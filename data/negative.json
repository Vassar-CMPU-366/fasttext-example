It is as materially poor as it is culturally rich. And Puerto Rico has entered a new and exotic version of bankruptcy, facing a staggering $123 billion in debt and pension obligations.\nIn short, it is difficult to imagine a worse time for governing-party officials in this struggling Caribbean commonwealth to persuade Washington it is ready to become the 51st American state.\nBut they have pledged to make their case anyway.\nTell them that it seems impossible, and they will conjure the long moral arc of the universe and how it bends toward Puerto Rican statehood. “That’s what they told the blacks,” an indignant Ramón Rosario Cortés, Puerto Rico’s public affairs secretary, said in an interview last week. “That they were wasting their time attending the marches of Martin Luther King Jr. because nobody was ever going to hear the cry of the people!”\nA vigorous push for statehood was a central campaign promise of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, 38, who was inaugurated in January. Next month, he will ask residents to vote, in a nonbinding referendum, for statehood as part of a long-term fix for a commonwealth facing a period of severe austerity that is likely to include shuttered public schools, frozen salaries, slashed pensions and crimped investments in public health. The island remains in the grip of a recession that has lingered for much of the past decade.\nStatehood, Mr. Rosselló and his allies argue, would mean more investment in infrastructure, which would attract more businesses and create a more stable economy. Mr. Rosselló has also criticized Puerto Rico’s current relationship with the mainland as a “colonial status” that deprives its 3.4 million residents “of the right to political, social and economic equality under the U.S. flag.”\nBut Mr. Rosselló must not simply convince a wary Congress, which, by law, holds the key to Puerto Rico’s relationship with the United States. On the island, the “status” issue, as it is typically called, has for decades been the defining — and most divisive — question at the heart of Puerto Rican politics.\nThe three main political parties are not really divided along ideological lines; rather, Puerto Ricans know them as the party of statehood, the party of independence and the party that supports some improved version of the status quo. Voters in the June 11 referendum will be asked to choose among those three visions, and Mr. Rosselló’s allies are making a big push.\n“Treasure your American citizenship,” read signs posted around the capital. “Guarantee it. Vote for statehood.”\nBut resistance runs deep. Jose Falu, 63, a black Puerto Rican who served in the Army from 1978 to 1984, was visiting the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in San Juan last week. He said he would like to see the commonwealth receive the same treatment as states — but not become a state. “I’ve lived in the United States during my period in the Army,” he said, “and they don’t treat the Puerto Ricans the same way as the Americans.”\nSuch is the swirl of complex feelings toward the mainland in Puerto Rico, obtained by the United States in 1898 as a spoil of the Spanish-American War. Its mash-up Caribbean culture has long encompassed strains of ardent American patriotism and concerns about the dilution of a unique Hispanic heritage, and its compatibility with the broader American project. In San Juan, the Capitol is adorned on the inside with paintings of Puerto Ricans who served with particular distinction and bravery in the American military. Abraham Lincoln’s famous quotation — “government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth” — graces the exterior.\nSome Puerto Ricans believe that the best expression of that sentiment would be a declaration of independence from the United States, but their numbers are small: The Puerto Rican Independence Party has never won the governorship.\n“I don’t feel optimistic at all” about achieving independence, said Humberto Rodríguez Ortiz, 29, an artist and bartender. “I just hope for it like a little kid.”\nDuring the Cold War era, the F.B.I. tried to undermine the independence movement here, but it has also been weakened by the perks of commonwealth status. Though Puerto Ricans residing on the island do not vote for president, and their sole representative in Congress cannot cast a vote, they are United States citizens and may move to the mainland as they please.\nIt is an option Puerto Ricans have increasingly taken advantage of in their effort to escape the economic malaise on the island, where 46 percent of the people are in poverty and the unemployment rate was 11.5 percent in March. More than 400,000 have moved to the mainland in the past decade. As of 2013, there were 5.1 million Puerto Ricans living on the mainland, according to the Pew Research Center, while the number of residents in the commonwealth is expected to dip below 3 million by 2050.\nThe middle ground has long been occupied by the Popular Democratic Party. Its leaders do not want to abandon the autonomy that the current status provides, but they argue that serious changes are needed if the island’s economy is to be saved.\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Héctor Ferrer, the party president, argued, among other things, that Congress should modify the Jones Act of 1920, which prohibits non-American ships from carrying goods between the island and the mainland, an exclusion that he said pushes up the prices of consumer goods and gasoline.\nBut he also criticized the referendum language, and warned of the cultural losses that would come with statehood. “We will lose our autonomy,” he said. “We will lose our culture. We will lose our language.”\nAt their conventions last year, Democrats and Republicans expressed support for the ability of Puerto Rico to choose its status. But skeptics on the island wonder how seriously statehood would be taken in Congress, given that it would mean billions more in outlays for federal programs in Puerto Rico; and in the Trump administration, where the White House has taken down the Spanish-language page of its website and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has supported efforts to make English the official language. During a debate, Mr. Trump criticized Jeb Bush for speaking Spanish on the campaign trail, saying, “This is a country where we speak English.”\nMr. Rosselló’s New Progressive Party controls both houses of the legislature, but his critics note that he was elected in November with only 42 percent of the vote, and the two main opposition parties have pledged to boycott the referendum.\nThe crisis has driven some Puerto Ricans into Mr. Rosselló’s camp. Erick Storer, 36, became a convert to the statehood movement when he was laid off three months ago from his job in the pharmaceutical industry. The sector had thrived here thanks to generous corporate tax breaks created by Congress in 1976.\nBut Congress began phasing out the breaks in 1996, and they disappeared in 2006 — one reason, experts say, the economy has taken such a hit. With no representation in Congress, residents like Mr. Storer have been left feeling as if they have little say in policy making.\n“We’re part of it, and we’re not part of it, and I don’t like that,” said Mr. Storer, who drives for Uber to make ends meet.\nOthers warn that statehood will not be a panacea. Among other things, Puerto Ricans would have to give up their current exemption from federal income tax for income earned in the commonwealth.\nFor some statehood supporters, the slim chance of convincing Congress of their cause is not as important as sending Washington a strong message. “It’s just so they can hear our voice,” said Marcos Díaz, 46, the owner of a moving company.\nBut there is also fear that the effort and attention being lavished on the referendum will be just one more distraction from the issues the island needs to address, among them corruption, nepotism and the need for a cleareyed economic plan. The last time a status referendum was held, in 2012, 61 percent of voters chose statehood, but the Popular Democratic Party instructed its followers to leave ballots blank, and argued that the end result had little merit.\n“I personally think it’s a waste of time,” said Gretchen Sierra-Zorita, a consultant who works with a number of Puerto Rico organizations in Washington. “Puerto Rico puts so much emphasis on electing parties and party leaders that represent a status option as opposed to a good-governance option.”\nSome of that sentiment was echoed last Tuesday afternoon at Yordy’s Mini-Market. A testament to Puerto Ricans’ enduring knack for industry and improvisation, it is part hardware store and part bar, with drinks mixed next to a key-duplicating machine during happy hour.\n“Neither Republicans nor Democrats want us,” Roberto Reyes Villegas, 50, a carpenter who works for San Juan’s municipal government, said as he drank a Medalla Light beer.\nMr. Reyes described himself as a regular voter who was not loyal to any party. But he said he refused to participate in the referendum. It was little more than a distraction, he said, cooked up by what he called the “legisladrones,” or thieving lawmakers, who, he said, have been “sucking millions out of Puerto Rico.”\nMr. Reyes said the austerity plans had not touched his salary or benefits yet. And at age 50, he is taking a philosophical view of what comes next, paraphrasing Einstein’s contention that the distinction between past, present and future was a “stubbornly persistent illusion.”\nHe knows that the future is a more concrete and perhaps frightening proposition for his 18-year-old son. But his son, Mr. Reyes said, is smart and bilingual. If things get worse, he said, his son would probably just move away."},{"url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/no-more-holding-that-phone-while-driving-under-new-law-in-washington","title":"No more holding that phone while driving under new law in Washington state","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Seattle Times","description":"Gov.

The first distracted-driving offense would also be reportable to insurance companies, which could raise rates like any other moving violation.\nAnother section of the new law also says a person who engages in “any activity not related to the actual operation of a motor vehicle” is subject to pay an additional fine of $100. It only applies if an officer catches a driver being distracted while committing a standard traffic offense, such as running a stop sign because their coffee spilled or a pet jumped in their lap.\nExemptions under the law include using an electronic device to contact emergency services, or operating an amateur radio station or two-way or citizens band radio services.\nAlso signed by Inslee on Tuesday was a measure that would make a fourth driving-under-the-influence offense a felony in Washington state. The new law allows prosecutors to file felony charges if a person gets a fourth DUI within 10 years. Existing law requires four misdemeanor DUI convictions over 10 years before the fifth offense can be charged as a felony."},{"url":"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/06/02/529759280/many-copd-patients-struggle-to-pay-for-each-breath","title":"Many COPD Patients Struggle To Pay For Each Breath","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"NPR.org","description":"One in 9 Medicare enrollees have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and many of them can't afford the inhalers that keep them out of the emergency room.","date":"","full_text":"After a lifetime of smoking, Juanita Milton needs help breathing.\nShe's tethered to an oxygen tank 24/7 and uses two drug inhalers a day, including Spiriva, which she calls \"the really expensive one.\"\n\"If I can't afford it, I won't take it,\" Milton says.\nThe 67-year-old's chest was heaving one recent morning from the effort of walking down the hallway into the kitchen. Her voice was constricted as she loaded medication into a device about the size of her palm.\n\"Capsule in. You close it and you push this blue button,\" Milton says, demonstrating how the device punctures the pill. She then takes two labored breaths to inhale the powder inside the capsule. \"And that's it.\"\nMilton, like many Medicare enrollees, is on a fixed income. She has $2,000 a month to pay for a mortgage, car payment, Medicare premiums and other expenses.\n\"I got to stretch out that, plus I have the less costly medicines that I have to pay for and also my oxygen,\" Milton says. \"You can only stretch it so far.\"\nAn estimated 1 in 9 Medicare beneficiaries are diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. And, in 2014, COPD was the third-leading cause of death in the country, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Inhalers like Spiriva and Advair account for billions in Medicare spending each year.\nYet, even if they are only responsible for monthly copays, many enrollees like Milton can't afford their inhalers. Milton depends on free samples provided by her doctor for her prescription of one inhaler, Breo Ellipta, but the supply is limited, so she regularly skips one of the two daily doses. And, in order to afford her Spiriva, she applied for drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim's financial assistance program and received one year's worth of free samples.\nBut, on a recent morning, Milton was down to two doses of Spiriva. Holding up a silver sleeve of medication, Milton says \"This is all I have left. So, if [the drugmaker doesn't] approve me for this year, I'm going to have to ask Dr. Stigall if there's something else I can take.\"\nDr. Brian Stigall of Hill Country Medical Associates in New Braunfels, Texas, keeps a closet full of free drug samples for patients like Milton.\n\"Thank goodness, the drug reps are good. They bring us lots of samples,\" Stigall says. \"I save those samples back for those Medicare patients.\"\nWithout the inhalers, patients suffer, he says. \"They are going to end up back in the hospital and they're going to end up seeing me much more often.\"\nPatients who suffer a full-blown attack, due to low oxygen intake, could need three to seven days of emergency treatment, Stigall says.\nRetiree Ken Wagar, who lives in Winter Haven, Fla., buys his inhalers overseas. Instead of paying Medicare copays of more than $500 for three-month supplies of Advair and Spiriva, Wagar pays $248 for the same amount of Advair and $73 for Spiriva.\n\"It's common and easy,\" says Wagar, 68. \"You have to order in advance because it takes a while to ship. ... You do what you have to do.\"\nAcross the country, doctors who treat COPD say costs are a common problem for patients. Dr. David Mannino at the University of Kentucky College of Public Health says some patients cut pills in half or take a prescription once a day instead of twice, just to save money.\nDr. Momen Wahidi, a pulmonologist at Duke University School of Medicine, says many patients \"weren't able to use [an inhaler because they] couldn't get it, couldn't afford it.\" And, when Dr. Peter Castaldi of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston surveyed thousands of Medicare patients in 2006, up to a third said they couldn't take their medication because of cost.\n\"Even at a relatively, seemingly, low amount of $20 per month out-of-pocket costs, you could see the effects of cost on people being able to take their medications,\" Castaldi says.\nAnd prices have only increased since 2006. Spiriva's list price has jumped 31 percent the past five years to $368 for a 30-day supply, according to drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim. And Breo Ellipta's price has risen 20 percent since 2013 to $321.74 a month, according to drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline.\nSpokespeople for both drug companies say insured patients would not pay those prices because of discounts, rebates and other price concessions negotiated with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. For example, GlaxoSmithKline estimated that the average out-of-pocket cost for patients with Medicare's drug coverage, Medicare Part D, was $33 in 2015 when the drug's list price was $281 for a month's supply.\nBut it's \"not unusual [for patients] to be on more than one inhaler\" and those costs add up, says Dr. Chien-Wen Tseng, with the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine and the Pacific Health Research and Education Institute.\nIn a recent letter published in JAMA, Tseng analyzed Medicare's prescription drug formularies in 2015 and the projected cost of deductibles and copays. She found that Medicare Part D beneficiaries with multiple inhalers could spend more than $2,800 in out-of-pocket costs annually.\nThe high price of inhalers is expensive for the Medicare program and \"drives people into the doughnut hole,\" she says. The dreaded doughnut hole is a coverage gap for Medicare Part D patients. Enrollees pay more for drugs out-of-pocket once the coverage gap is reached.\n\"Medicare Part D was really designed in 2006 with 2006 prices,\" Tseng says. In 2017, with much higher drug prices, \"does Medicare Part D really still work?\"\nFor Milton, the answer seems obvious: It doesn't. Most mornings after taking her Spiriva, Milton sits on her back patio. There, she talks with God.\n\"I don't pray,\" she says. \"I talk. I carry on a conversation.\"\nAnd that conversation often turns to her struggles with COPD.\n\"I understand and I have to accept it. I know that it was my doing,\" Milton says, adding, \"everything is in his hands.\"\nEditor's note: After this story was published, GlaxoSmithKline, which manufactures Breo Ellipta, noted that it recommends the drug be taken once a day. Doctors may prescribe twice-a-day dosage, however.\nSarah Jane Tribble is a senior correspondent at Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent newsroom that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

Supporters say it provides important legal cover from lawsuits, but critics say it allows religious institutions to discriminate against households of different religions, or LGBT parents.\nTexas House Bill 3859, titled the “Freedom to Serve Children Act,” was passed with a 93-49 vote, and it now heads to the state Senate for further debate. The bill was pitched by its author, Texas Representative James Frank, as defending the religious freedoms of adoption agencies. About one-quarter of all Texas adoption facilities affiliate with a religion, and Frank said the bill defends these from lawsuits if the agencies deny potential parents based on “sincerely held religious beliefs.”\nSimilar laws have been passed in five other states, most recently in Alabama. Texas’s would impact the most children, and is the most sweeping, because it includes state-funded agencies, whereas most other such laws do not. The adoption laws are ideologically aligned with those like Indiana’s 2015 “Religious Freedom Restoration Act,” signed into law by current Vice President Mike Pence when he was the state’s governor, which allowed a pizza restaurant to deny catering services to gay weddings.\nAdoption agencies in Texas are overburdened, underfunded, and plagued with abuse problems. Frank said his bill would ease these issues if passed. But it’s not clear how this would happen, critics say, and they doubted a law that provides legal cover for agencies to deny adoptions would lead to more placements. “Say you call an agency and say, ‘I’m Jewish,’ and it’s a Catholic agency and they hang up on you,” Suzanne Bryant, an adoption rights attorney, told the Associated Press, “The bill says you can be referred to another agency, but there’s no mechanism to set that up.”\nMost adoptions in the state go through Child Protective Services, a government agency not subject to the law. And in Texas, private and publicly funded adoption and foster care agencies are already allowed to choose who they place a child with, factoring in things like whether or not the parents attend church weekly, if they’re LGBT, and how long they’ve been married. So Frank argued his bill only adds legal protection to rules already on the books."},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-05-16/trump-s-leaks-russian-officials-could-discourage-us-allies-sharing-intelligence","title":"Trump’s leaks to Russian officials could discourage US allies from sharing intelligence","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Public Radio International","description":"Did the Trump leaks to Russian officials damage US intelligence relationships?","date":"","full_text":"cia.jpg\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to share classified information with Russian officials has the potential to severely harm the United States’ intelligence relationships with allies, a foreign official said.\nAccording to a report by The New York Times, Israel — a longtime intelligence-sharing partner — is the original source of the classified material Trump shared with Russian officials during a meeting at the White House last week. That could incentivize allies to withhold intelligence from the US, which currently benefits from a variety of intelligence-sharing agreements like the Five Eyes agreement with Canada, the UK, New Zealand and Australia.\n“We’re really dependent on getting information-sharing analysis, comparing notes with our partners and allies — it's a source of strength and support from the United States,” said Richard Nephew, a former National Security Council and State Department official who's now at Columbia University.\nSo far, at least one senior European intelligence official has said his country might stop sharing information with the US, according to a report from The Associated Press — “a damaging sign of how deeply this leak ... is potentially damaging for intelligence sharing,” Nephew said.\nWhat may be even more damaging, Nephew says, is if allies limit the intelligence shared to “low-level information.”\n“If you've got the good stuff — you know, information that was very difficult to acquire, very sensitive, potentially involving sources who have put their lives at risk — are you going to risk that information to share with the United States now?” Nephew said. “I think it's going to lead a number of our partners and allies to ask themselves that question ... and then make the decision maybe not to withhold all forms of cooperation but the most vital — the most sensitive intelligence — and that, after all, can be the most damaging thing.”\nWithout that intelligence, the US will be left “blind from a policy perspective” and “unable to accurately determine what policy is or should take if we don't know what we don't know,” Nephew said.\nThe loss of trust also poses an immediate security risk, as the US will be unable to learn “about emergent threats, problems that are coming across the transom that governments need to deal with,” Nephew said.\nOne more thing…\nPRI takes a global approach to the news of the day.

Get things tidy the night before\nA few simple steps taken before bed can make all the difference to our morning happiness. For me, that means placing a bottle of water on my nightstand (I always wake up thirsty,) and making sure the coffee pot is programmed to start brewing the minute my eyes are pried open by an enthusiastic toddler.\nTry laying out your clothes for the day, prepare your lunch and if you are feeling really ambitious have your gym bag packed and ready at the door.\nA study in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin found that that women who described their homes as “messy” or “cluttered” were more prone to depression, fatigue, and anxiety. Having a quick tidy before bed ensures you wake up without a list of chores to do.\n2. Do some quick stretches\nMost people get up too quickly in the mornings without giving their body time to wake up. Instead try lying in your bed for a while and stretching out all your muscles, then slowly rise and do more simple stretches.\nScientific American reported on a study that shows even small amounts of physical activity can make you feel good.\n3. Indulge in the bathroom\nInstead of just jumping in the shower and sudsing with a basic soap take the time to make this a mini spa experience. Use a luxe shower gel, body lotion and invest in fluffy towels. Add some whale song for the ultimate in gentle waking.\nInnovative thought and creativity can strike you in the shower, bolstering happiness and self worth, according to Washington University psychologist R.

If you can’t bear to eat early in the morning try a liquid breakfast like a smoothie or veggie juice with mood boosting ingredients.\nA study in Psychological Science found that by being organized with a little pre-planning we naturally make better nutritional decisions.\n5. Plan something fun for later\nIf all else fails, having something to look forward to during the day really helps to chase away the early morning blues.

Part 1 of 2.","date":"2017-05-09","full_text":"Fort Lauderdale, Fla. —When she enrolled in a South Florida drug treatment program in 2015, Alison Flory had high hopes of getting her life in order and starting anew.\nBut instead of receiving life-saving health care, the 23-year-old from a Chicago suburb found herself being recruited from one recovery residence to another as a string of shady drug treatment facilities systematically overcharged her mother’s health insurance policy for expensive, unnecessary procedures and tests.\nBy October 2016, Alison was dead.\nThis is the story of how two troublesome national trends – booming drug addiction rates and widespread fraud in the health care industry – conspired to destroy a young woman’s life.\nThe US is in the midst of an epidemic of drug addiction and fatal overdoses with more than 52,000 deaths in 2015 – and the numbers are rising. The carnage is fueled in part by the widespread legal distribution of opiates to medical patients, easy availability of cheap heroin, as well as an ever-expanding lineup of other types of prescription drugs and synthetic intoxicants ripe for abuse.\nThe crisis is creating a broad new spectrum of Americans struggling with addiction – from suburban high school students, to young adults, to white-collar office workers, to grandmothers on Medicare.\nAt the same time, America is facing an epidemic of fraud in the health-care industry. Experts estimate that the government and private insurance companies lose $100 billion each year to health care scams and fraudulent claims. (That is more than the entire GDP of 131 of the world’s 195 countries. It would place 24th on the Fortune 500 list of largest US corporations, ahead of Boeing, Microsoft, and Bank of America.)\nSome Americans cynically dismiss health-care fraud as something less than a major crime problem, federal investigators say. It is just money from the government or money from deep-pocket insurance companies, these cynics suggest.\nBut when greed replaces much needed health care for the most vulnerable in society, experts say, the result can be devastating – even fatal.\nThis is Alison’s story.\nOver a 15-month period in 2015 and 2016, Alison moved nine times to different drug treatment centers. It was largely the work of fellow addicts – young men – who were paid to lure her and others away from their current treatment program. They did so with the promise of free rent, free use of a scooter, and other benefits – including possible romance – if the patient agreed to enroll in a particular treatment program and live in a recovery residence or sober home associated with that treatment program.\nSobriety had nothing to do with it. It is an open secret among addicts enrolled in South Florida treatment facilities that hundreds of suburban homes posing as drug-free recovery residences are little more than co-ed flop houses where the use of drugs is permitted and sometimes encouraged.\nRather than promoting health and healing, the business model that supports this multimillion-dollar health-care fraud involves warehousing addicts in fake sober homes to facilitate the perpetual fleecing their parents’ insurance policies.\nMany of the addicts are complicit in the scam, using their parents’ insurance benefits like a credit card to fund a work-free and responsibility-free South Florida lifestyle while hiding behind a false façade of “treatment.”\nFor individuals struggling under the weight of addiction with poor judgment, low self-esteem, and inadequate coping skills, this scam and the associated lifestyle is the antithesis of rehabilitation.\n“This goes beyond anything I could ever imagine, that so many people are so selfish and heartless,” Alison’s mother, Jennifer Flory, said in an interview.\nAt first, Ms. Flory was relieved that under the Affordable Care Act a parent’s health insurance policy extends to their children up to age 26 – including requiring open-ended coverage for drug treatment programs.\nA mother of five, Flory was working in a job she didn’t particularly like, but she resolved to remain in that job because it came with a generous health insurance plan that she couldn’t otherwise afford. “I thought [having health insurance covering Alison] was a blessing. I thought, I have to keep this job until Alison is out of treatment,” she said.\nNow, two years later, she has a different perspective. “Oh my God, if I would have just lost my job and not had insurance, she would still be alive.”\nEvidence of fraud\nThroughout her daughter’s ordeal, evidence of fraud arrived almost daily at Flory’s house in Illinois. But she didn’t know what to look for.\n“I would get bills and bills and bills in the mail and half of the time I would just throw them in a drawer,” she said. “I just thought, ‘Oh cool, Alison is getting treatment.’ ”\nMany of the statements were for expensive drug tests at sophisticated laboratories. Random spot tests cost $5 to $10 each and can be performed once a week or less.\nIn contrast, under the fraudulent business model that has taken root in South Florida and elsewhere, certain treatment programs are collecting their patient’s urine three times a week and sending it to a lab for highly sophisticated testing. Instead of $5 to $10, these tests cost anywhere from $1,000 to $4,000, or more.\nSuch bills are routinely being sent out and they are routinely being paid by insurance companies. They fuel an insurance-funded web of bribes and kickbacks with a steady stream of payoffs flowing between treatment centers, patient recruiters, sober homes, and laboratory operators, according to law enforcement officials.\nDuring Alison’s 15 months in drug treatment, her mother estimates her insurance company was billed $750,000. It is not clear how much of that was actually paid by the company.\nIn a single day, she says, her insurance was once charged $10,000 from a treatment center that her daughter may or may not have attended for that one day. “She never told me anything about it,” Flory says.\nFor Flory, her daughter’s experience has produced more questions than answers.\n“My question to the treatment centers is this: So you guys have billed my insurance almost $750,000 and my daughter is dead. You mean to tell me that $750,000 cannot get a person to a stable point in life to be able to function?”\nHow patients are recruited\nAlison’s story begins with a tragedy eight years ago, in May 2009, when she was in high school. Shortly after she broke up with her boyfriend, he threw himself in front of a speeding train. Alison was at his side in the hospital when he was pronounced dead. She was 17.\nThe pain and guilt nearly crushed her, according to her mother. A friend wanted to help and gave her some pills to make her feel better. That is the moment the door opened to addiction.\nAfter graduating from high school, Alison studied video-game design and art in college. Then she worked at a fabric store, as a dance instructor, and at the front desk of a hotel.\nBy 2015, Alison’s mother recognized that her daughter had a drug problem. Alison admitted her addiction and said she wanted her life back. She enrolled in a drug treatment program in Pompano Beach, Fla.\nOnce in Florida, she improved and seemed to be firmly on the path to recovery. After being released from detox, she moved to an intensive out-patient program (IOP) at a drug treatment center where she received counseling, therapy, and drug testing.\nAs an out-of-state patient, she needed to find a place to live during the treatment. That is where sober homes and halfway houses enter the picture. Such recovery residences are usually a group house in a suburban neighborhood shared by other recovering addicts. Legitimate recovery residences charge their patients rent and do not permit co-ed housing.\nAt some point during this second-level of treatment, Alison attended an anti-addiction group meeting where she was approached by an attractive young man who suggested that she move to a different treatment center and into a co-ed recovery residence where she wouldn’t have to pay any rent.\n“She ended up admitting [later] that she was following him [for potential romantic reasons], but what she didn’t realize is that the guy was getting paid,” says Flory. “So it was never in her best interest, ever.”\nIn retrospect, it was a turning point. It took Alison off a road to recovery and put her instead on a path toward relapse after relapse after relapse.\nA shady treatment center\nBy switching, she was leaving behind a reputable and successful treatment program to enroll in something called Reflections Treatment Center in Margate, Fla.\nReflections paid patient recruiters and brokers to identify young patients whose parents’ insurance policies could be systematically overcharged.\nScores of unscrupulous treatment centers in South Florida are conducting the same insurance scam, but law enforcement and other officials say Reflections appears to have been the worst of the worst.\nReflections was run by Kenneth “Kenny” Chatman, a convicted felon who had served time in federal prison for stealing credit card numbers. He registered Reflections in his wife’s name to conceal his own involvement.\nOthers in the drug-treatment community saw what he was doing.\n“Everyone knows Chatman was a [problem], I mean basically we all knew,” says Richard Riccardi, owner of Fellowship Living Facilities, which runs long-established, legitimate recovery residences in Margate and Fort Lauderdale.\nFBI agents raided and shut down Reflections in December. Mr. Chatman was arrested and later pleaded guilty to health-care fraud. He also admitted that he engaged in sex trafficking by recruiting some of his addicted female patients to work in the sex industry.\nJohn Lehman, president of the Florida Association of Recovery Residences, says Chatman showed up on his radar several years ago. “All the kids that were living in various [recovery] houses in Palm Beach and Broward Counties would be transported to Reflections for ‘treatment,’ ” he says. “But none of them were getting any treatment. It was a joke.”\nIn 2014, Mr. Lehman began pushing for an investigation. Eventually he went to the Palm Beach Post. Reporters began writing news stories about Chatman and corruption in the drug treatment and sober home industry. The Post reported that drug treatment had become a $1 billion business in Palm Beach County, the county’s fourth-largest industry.\nThe stories sparked a public outcry that prompted criminal investigations. A Sober Homes Task Force was set up to identify legislative and other solutions.\nBut in September, just as federal agents were zeroing in on Chatman’s alleged scams, his wife, Laura, applied for a license to open a second drug treatment facility. To Lehman’s disbelief, the Florida Department of Children and Family Services granted a provisional license.\n“Everyone on the planet knew that this guy should be shut down, yet they make application and are issued another provisional license,” Lehman says.\nA systemic problem\nIt wasn’t just Chatman and Reflections. The proliferation of overbilling and sober home scams in Florida have made it difficult for legitimate recovery residences to stay in business.\nThere are 958 licensed drug treatment centers in Florida and roughly 3,000 legitimate recovery residences in the state. Lehman estimates that 6,000 to 7,000 houses claiming to be sober homes are really drug dens or flop houses.\nAt any one time there are as many as 10,000 patients enrolled in clinical drug treatment services in Florida. Of those, 75 percent are from out of state, he says.\nMost will seek to live in a recovery residence in Florida rather than return home immediately after detox treatment, creating a market of addicts that is exploited by corrupt treatment centers. They pay kickbacks of $400 to $500 per week to sober homes for each insured resident who signs up for treatment, Lehman says.\nThe need for housing is the leverage that these treatment centers use to obtain new patients and gain access to their parents’ insurance benefits, officials say. Insurance companies will pay for drug treatment, but not forever. When the coverage lapses, the fraudsters need a way to extend the insurance gravy train.\nShady treatment centers often give their clients two options: Hit the road or “take what is behind Door No. 2,” says Lehman.\nHe says the option behind “Door No. 2” sounds something like this: “It says here on your medical chart you are a heroin user. You go out and have a weekend party with your friends and you shoot lots of heroin and then you go back to detox and when you get out of detox you can come back into the [IOP] program and your insurance benefits will be reset because it will be a new episode of care. And we can bill your insurance company and therefore you can have all the housing you want.”\nIt sets up a cycle of recovery and relapse.\n“I have met people on the street and they have been down here for two or three years on the spin cycle under two or three different policies,” says Maureen Kielian, Florida director of Steered Straight, an anti-addiction group, and a member of the Sober Homes Task Force.\nMs. Kielian says there is a huge downside to drug treatment insurance scams. “It keeps those seeking recovery sick,” she says. “It just keeps them sick, and they are dying.”\nConsequences: overdose deaths\nBetween 2012 and 2015, the number of overdose deaths more than doubled in Palm Beach County, where many of the treatment centers and recovery residences are located. The county medical examiner is still compiling the total for 2016, but the expectation is that it will almost double again from 307 to nearly 600 overdose deaths in 2016.\n“It is horrific,” says Al Johnson, chief assistant in the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office, who heads the Sober Homes Task Force.\nJohnson says his office receives frequent phone calls from parents worried about their children in treatment. One said she was sure her son wouldn’t survive the year. She wanted to come to Florida to see him one last time.\nAnother parent called and said her daughter had relapsed and she didn’t know where she was but that she was sure she was in a “bad place.” Johnson adds: “Our investigator said, ‘Ma’am, get on an airplane, come down, get your daughter, and take her home.’ ”\nThe point of the task force is to save the legitimate treatment centers and recovery residences and weed out the bad actors, Johnson says. “Let’s clean up the industry so this truly is the place to go for effective, productive treatment,” he says. “There are good providers that are dedicated not to a profit motive but to recovery.”\nThere are signs of a potential turnaround. “I was told by the code enforcement chief in Delray Beach that 40 houses have closed down,” Johnson says, referring to flop houses.\nHow Reflections was shut down\nOne of the biggest problems faced by addicts and their family members is trying to differentiate between legitimate providers and corrupt providers.\n“It’s disgusting, these people and what they do,” says Flory. “Alison’s case was particularly horrible because she got wrapped up in the Kenny Chatman thing,” she says.\n“She got into every sad thing I think there was,” Flory says of her daughter’s experience in South Florida.\nShe partly blames herself. “I told her to trust the people who were looking over her. I told her she needs to not make decisions on her own. Let the people around her who care about her and are treating her, the doctors and so forth, let them help her to make decisions.”\nThe mother adds: “Little did I know I was telling her to put all her trust and faith into these people who were taking advantage of her. That’s what got me, there is so much more to it than just a young girl making bad choices.”\nAmong those people was Chatman.\nOn March 15, he appeared in federal court in West Palm Beach in handcuffs and leg irons. Prosecutors said he and his companies received fraudulent insurance reimbursement payments of between $9.5 million and $25 million.\nAccording to a signed statement as part of his guilty plea, Chatman and others recruited some of his female patients residing in sober homes into prostitution. They advertised on websites like Craig’s List and Backpage.com.\nThe statement adds: “The defendant and co-conspirators provided controlled substances to these addicted patients to induce them to perform sexual acts.”\nImplicit in this arrangement was Chatman’s power to also withhold controlled substances from drug-dependent women. Those who were noncompliant with Chatman’s wishes could face debilitating symptoms of sudden drug withdrawal, loss of income, and eviction from the sober home. In essence, they could be dumped on the street, sick and homeless.\nBy contrast, those who complied were not required to attend drug treatment sessions and submit to drug testing – but their insurance policies were billed as if they had, according to the signed statement.\nAt one female-only sober home, near West Palm Beach, Chatman confiscated cell phones, screwed down the windows, and prohibited the women from leaving the house, according to court documents.\nChatman could have faced up to life in prison on the sex trafficking charge, but with federal sentencing guidelines he will likely spend 12 ½ to 15 years in prison under his plea agreement. His sentencing is set for May 17.\nChatman wasn’t the only one responsible for the fraud at Reflections.\nThe medical director at Reflections was Donald Willems. During his tenure at Reflections, Dr. Willems was under indictment in state court on pending racketeering conspiracy charges for allegedly helping to run an opiate pill mill in Pompano Beach a few years earlier.\nOn March 23, Willems pleaded guilty in the Chatman case. He admitted that he used his position as a licensed physician to falsely declare that the excessive drug testing and other treatments at Reflections were medically necessary and thus covered by health insurance policies.\nIn addition to excessive drug tests, he authorized expensive saliva, DNA, and allergy testing, regardless of whether patients had allergies or any need for such tests.\nDespite his actions in the Chatman case and the pending charges in the 2012 pill mill case, Willems’ medical license remained in good standing with a “Clear/Active” listing right up to the day of his guilty plea.\nBarry Gregory, a licensed mental health counselor, worked as the clinical director at Reflections. In a YouTube video shot in September 2015, Dr. Gregory said Reflections was licensed to provide three different levels of care. “We really believe our job is to save lives and that is what we are doing,” he says on the video.\nOn Feb. 16, Gregory pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit health-care fraud. In a signed statement as part of his guilty plea, Gregory admitted that he knew that Chatman was telling patients that they were allowed to continue to use drugs while they were clients at the treatment center.\n“As many as 90 percent of the patients [at Reflections] continued to use controlled substances while purportedly obtaining treatment,” Gregory said in the statement.\nOct. 14, 2016\nIn August 2016, Alison moved with her boyfriend into her last sober home, this one a yellow three-bedroom ranch-style house on NW 33rd Avenue in Lauderdale Lakes.\nThe neighborhood had seen better days. Two years ago, the community of 35,000 was named one of the 10 most dangerous towns in Florida. Crack cocaine was being sold in the parking lot of a convenience store a few blocks from the sober home.\nBut Alison had a reason to move in. She could live there rent-free, and was also being paid $350 a week. According to her mother, the payment was for her work as a “house manager.” She was also enrolled at Reflections and supposedly was attending treatment sessions three times a week. This was her second stint as a patient at Reflections.\nFlory confirms that her insurance was being billed during that period for treatments and drug tests.\nThe sober home on NW 33rd Avenue was rented by a man who lived next door and ran the sober home. He had a van and would transport the clients to their treatment sessions at Reflections. According to Alison’s mother, sometimes Chatman himself would arrive in a van to pick up Reflections clients.\nAt some point in the early morning hours of Oct. 14, Alison and one of her housemates, Nicole De La Pena, decided to smoke crack cocaine. Earlier, they made a purchase down the street, according to an account Nicole gave to her mother, Johanna.\nWhat neither Alison nor Nicole could know was that the crack cocaine they were about to smoke was laced with carfentanil.\nThree weeks earlier, the Drug Enforcement Administration had issued a nationwide warning about carfentanil, a synthetic opiate said to be 10,000 times more powerful than morphine. The DEA warned that mere skin contact could cause an overdose in a paramedic or police officer responding to an emergency. A dose of carfentanil about the size of a grain of salt would likely be fatal to a human, experts say.\nAlison was last seen alive by her boyfriend at 4 a.m. when he saw her asleep in her bed and still breathing.\nLater that morning around 8:30 a.m., the man who ran the sober home arrived to take clients to their treatment sessions at Reflections. He was unable to awaken Alison.\nAccording to a recording of the 911 call, it took the house manager 37 seconds to vocalize a muffled, “Hello.”\n“Your phone dialed 911. Do you have an emergency,” the operator asked.\n“Yes, I am trying to figure out right now,” the manager responded. “Um, um, I have, I have, I have someone in here and she’s – we’re trying to wake her up but I don’t feel no pulse.”\nAt no point during the 911 call was the manager able to state the address of his sober home or even the nature of the emergency despite requests from the emergency operator. The call lasted one minute and 48 seconds.\nSome advocates for reform of the sober home industry say that those who run sober homes should be trained in CPR and maintain a stock of naloxone, an antidote for opiate overdoses.\nIt is not clear that this would have saved Alison’s life on the morning of Oct. 14, but experts say it might have.\nWhen paramedics arrived, they were unable to revive Alison. She was pronounced dead at 9:08 a.m.\nThe medical examiner’s report says Alison died of carfentanil and cocaine toxicity.\nPolice photos taken inside Alison’s room in the sober home shortly after her death show the presence of three postage-stamp sized pink plastic bags with white residue inside. Two were on the floor near her closet, one was inside a shoe. They are the type of bags that are used to sell street quantities of illegal drugs.\nIn addition, the photos reveal a five-inch glass tube with smoke residue inside and seven pills in a cluster on the night stand beside the bed.\n'All they care about is the money'\nFlory says there is no way to measure the pain caused to parents and other family members of addicts lost to drug addiction. “It is the most horrible thing I would imagine ever having to go through, losing my oldest kid,” Flory says.\n“We talked, we confided in each other, we hung out, we had the same sense of humor,” she says of her daughter. “She was literally my best friend.”\nUntil Alison’s experience in South Florida, Flory said she never really considered the full cost of fraud in the American health-care system.\n“I just thought it didn’t really affect anybody. Yeah, insurance fraud is making people’s premiums go up, but that’s it,” Flory says. “I didn’t know it was killing people.”\nAt some point during her ordeal in the South Florida spin cycle, Alison apparently figured it out. In a moment of candor she told her mother it was fraud, that it was all a gigantic scam. “All they care about is the money,” Alison said, according to her mother.\n“I told her, no, that’s not true,” Flory said she replied to her daughter. “She told me that these people are just greedy and selfish and they just want to make money. I said that is ridiculous.”\nThe mother adds: “I just thought she was trying to be dramatic. But yeah, she is laughing now. She is looking down and saying, ‘I told you so.’ ”\nFollow Stories Like This\nSign Up\nFlory says she is telling Alison’s story for one reason – to save other lives.\n“The most important thing is to understand what is happening and put an end to it,” she says. “To find a solution so that other people don’t have to go through this.”\nTomorrow, in part two of our special report, we’ll look at how mothers of drug addicts are creating an informal network to help others avoid the pitfalls they experienced."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/17/san-diego-california-homelessness-mayor-kevin-faulconer","title":"'A tableau of suffering': seaside city of San Diego faces a dark homelessness crisis","author_text":"Kelly Davis","keywords":["San Diego","California","Us News","Homelessness","Society","Housing","Communities","Poverty","Social Exclusion"],"publication_text":"the Guardian","description":"The southern California city has a reputation for beaches and beer. But amid a dramatic spike in homelessness, people are coming to terms with a new reality","date":"2017-05-17","full_text":"A “tableau of squalor and suffering” isn’t what comes to mind when people think of San Diego, a town with the motto “America’s finest city” and a reputation for its craft-beer culture and miles of beautiful beaches. But that’s how Dan McSwain, a columnist for the San Diego Union-Tribune, described the city’s homelessness crisis in a piece last year, the first in a series pillorying city leaders for not doing more to address the issue.\nSince then the situation has, if anything, worsened.\nOutside in America is a year-long series on homelessness in the western US. The project focuses on people on the frontline of a devastating crisis and enables readers to take action to help solve the problem.\nMore from this series\nA recent count found a dramatic 104% increase in “tents and hand-built structures” located downtown,for a total of 418, compared to 2016. Driving through East Village, a gentrifying neighborhood on the edge of downtown, it’s tough to find a street that doesn’t have a tarp or tent – or dozens. People with neither tent nor tarp fashion makeshift shelters out of shopping carts, storage bins and blankets.\nHelming the city during this crisis – and also the focus of criticism for what some onlookers call a failure to address it effectively – is San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer. A moderate Republican in a predominantly Democratic city, he acknowledges that homelessness may be the defining issue of his term.\n“We cannot just do what we’ve always been doing. It’s not working,” he said recently from his downtown office. Just before his interview with the Guardian, he had attended one of multiple weekly meetings focused solely on homelessness.\nThe issue is not new in San Diego. Nearly three decades ago, then-mayor Maureen O’Connor spent two days sleeping on the street, incognito, to get a better sense of the problem. But ambiguity over who is responsible for providing the bulk of homeless services, namely the city or the county in which it is located, has resulted in years of finger-pointing and stagnation.\nThere has been a steady increase in the homeless population under Faulconer’s watch; about 5,600 homeless people were recently counted in the city, and the county’s numbers place it among the top five US metro regions. Still, it would be tough to argue this is Faulconer’s fault.\nOther large west coast cities with high housing costs have seen similar increases; in San Diego, apartment rents average more than $1,700 a month. And since 2003, more than 5,000 residential hotel units, often considered the housing of last resort, have been demolished or converted into boutique hotels.\nThe situation has prompted frustration on all sides, and proposals that are a little off-the-wall: a pair of businessmen recently suggested banning camping downtown and restricting it to a site 13 miles outside the city. (They called it Camp Hope.) It may not be helping matters that the mayor’s point person on homelessness left her post last week without explanation.\nA southern California native, Faulconer started off in 2006 as a city councilman who had an uneasy relationship with homelessness. He repeatedly opposed locating a temporary emergency shelter in his downtown district. And he voiced support for arresting or ticketing people who sleep in public overnight. But since his election as mayor in 2014, Faulconer, either by will or force, seems to have grasped the severity of the issue.\nIn 2016, for instance, he allocated $3.3m to homelessness programs on top of the federal funding the city receives. He has also proposed an increase in the city’s hotel-room tax, a portion of which would go to homeless programs. The tax would need to be approved by voters, but Faulconer says he has the support of hoteliers and the city’s tourism industry, who’ve complained that homelessness is impacting their bottom line. One hotel manager said he recently had to scrambleto stop the cancellation of an event worth $500,000 after a planner said she didn’t feel safe outside.\nBut while many San Diegans might wish for a quick fix, it is proving difficult to bring people off the streets.\nDespite the rising homeless numbers, shelter usage is actually down, even on rainy nights when the city makes additional beds available. “Most folks out there, they think the best thing they have going is their tent,” said Bob McElroy, CEO of the Alpha Project, one of the city’s largest homeless services providers.\nAlpha Project has submitted a proposal to the city for an intake center with a “sleeping courtyard” that would accommodate up to 150 people and a camping space with room for 25 tents. Over a three-year period, the project would expand to include 700 units of permanent housing.\nThe idea of a safe space to pitch her tent is appealing to Lawell Brooks, a 29-year-old who sleeps under a blue tarp. On a recent morning, it was one of more than two dozen tents and tarp structures pushed up against a fenced-in empty lot in East Village. “I could probably have gotten a job by now,” she said, “but I don’t want to leave my stuff.”\nThe contours of her life are defined by her living situation. Each morning, she makes a quick trip two blocks over to a facility called Father Joe’s Villages,to take a shower and get dressed so she doesn’t appear to be residing outside. She’s been arrested simply for sleeping under her tarp, a violation of a city law banning “any vegetation or object” from being in the public right-of-way. Now she pays close attention to the signs on fences and light poles announcing when police and city workers will be conducting a clean-up.\nMichael McConnell, a homeless advocate who lives downtown, regularly documents these sweeps on social media; his posts suggest their futility. They show that a street cleared by mid-morning will be full of tents again within hours.\nAddressing homelessness means recognizing that one size doesn’t fit all, he said. McConnell supports the idea of giving people a safe place to sleep and having street outreach workers, not police, keep tabs on folks. Some might only need a few months of rental assistance, or help finding a landlord who’ll accept a housing voucher, he said. In other cases, it could take months before an outreach worker gains someone’s trust.\nHe is realistic about the city’s future.“People are not going to just disappear,” he said."},{"url":"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/06/are_you_smarter_about_the_law_than_a_seventh_grader_try_juvenile_jeopardy_pathways_to_peace.html","title":"Are you smarter about the law than a seventh grader?

And while there are many factors to consider, there’s evidence that automation and the rise of robots may not eliminate as many jobs as projected. Here are some of the sectors offering long-term job security for decades to come.\nCLEAN ENERGY\nThe fastest growing profession in the country: wind turbine technicians.\nSolar energy is also a bright spot for the unemployed and underemployed, “growing at a rate 12 times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy,” according a 2017 report published by Environmental Defense Fund. The majority of this growth consists of installation jobs. Robots can’t climb onto rooftops to mount photovoltaic panels (or repair them), which means there’s an ever-growing number of positions for living, breathing workers.\nEDUCATION, HEALTHCARE AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS\n“Where humanity matters there will be humans,” says business advisor and technology consultant Shelly Palmer.\nSchools, hospitals and businesses continue to need workers to do “people things” since robots can only react to predictive behaviors or conduct menial tasks. “Robots do not yet have the ability to perform complex tasks like negotiation or persuading, and they are not as proficient in generating new ideas as they are at solving problems,” says Mynul Khan, chief executive officer of Field Nation in an op-ed for Tech Crunch.\nTo learn how education could adapt in an automated world, check out this additional reading:\nENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE\nThe number of architectural and engineering jobs has more than tripled from last year’s average of 2,000 each month to 7,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the industry isn’t just having a moment. It’s estimated by 2022, biomedical engineering will experience 23 percent growth, environmental engineering 12 percent and civil engineering (the field with the most positions) 8.4 percent.\nFueling the demand for this non-automated workforce? An aging population and crumbling infrastructure.\nMAINTENANCE\nCall it “Rise of the Maintenance Workforce.” While robots are clearly putting pressure on the American labor force, when they break, humans are needed to fix them. The demand for people who can repair hardware and software, as well as code new programs, is expected to steadily increase. By 2022, there may be more than half a million new jobs in robotic and machine learning maintenance, installation and repair. Some labor experts project that modern technologies will ultimately create more jobs than they destroy.\nThis gradual shift can best be witnessed in U.S. manufacturing, which has shed almost 5 million jobs since 2000. The auto industry has introduced around 52,000 robots during the past seven years, helping to spur the creation of nearly 260,000 jobs. A 2013 study done by the International Federation of Robots (which despite its name is not made up of robots; rather it’s a group of tech industry leaders) estimated that 10 to 15 percent of jobs in the auto sector were created because robots and machines were introduced to assembly lines.\nTo learn more about how robotics is affecting manufacturing, check out this additional reading:\nThe New Hire: How a New Generation of Robots Is Transforming Manufacturing\nHow Artificial Intelligence and Robots Will Radically Transform the Economy"},{"url":"http://live.mprnews.org/Event/The_trial_of_officer_Jeronimo_Yanez","title":"Daily dispatches: The trial of officer Jeronimo Yanez","author_text":null,"keywords":["Breaking News","Courts","Crime","Police","Race"],"publication_text":"MPR News","description":"","date":"","full_text":"The aftermath: 18 arrested in peaceful protests following the verdict\nEighteen people were arrested after a march that blocked Interstate 94 in St. Paul late Friday night and into early Saturday morning.

Next City is exploring why–and seeking solutions from residents.","date":"2017-05-17","full_text":"Most often we hear about the zip codes in North Philadelphia, where some have lower life-expectancy rates than in Syria. Or we hear about how a once-poor area is becoming gentrified, with property rates going through the roof in Brewerytown in the 19121. Or, we hear about how the zip codes in Center City are rich—and getting richer. But what about the middle-class neighborhoods that haven’t seen many changes, or investments into their communities?\nThis is exactly what Ariella Cohen and her team at Next City, a Philly-based national online publication aiming to create better cities, asked themselves. And they found some worrisome answers for a “middle neighborhood” as urban planners call it, in the 19150—otherwise known as East Mount Airy.\nHer team commissioned socially conscious investment firm Reinvestment Fund to do a deep “data dive” into the area’s makeup and hired Philadelphia magazine real estate editor Sandy Smith to do on-the-ground reporting about what makes the community tick, Cohen said.\nWhat they found is that East Mount Airy is a historic, middle-class African-American neighborhood with very high voter turnout and civic engagement. But the area also is facing higher rates of foreclosure and eviction than is expected for an area that’s been stable for so long.\n“[East Mount Airy is] vulnerable because they aren’t getting as much attention or investment, but they have the existing community infrastructure for stability,” Cohen said.\nIn their series, Next City found some reasons why the area could soon be struggling. For one thing, the community is older, and when the 2008 mortgage crisis hit, many were approaching retirement age. Now, many families are struggling to maintain their homes at all, Next City reported.\n“[East Mount Airy is] vulnerable because they aren’t getting as much attention or investment, but they have the existing community infrastructure for stability,” Cohen said.\nTo discuss their findings in their five-month-long project into East Mount Airy, Next City is teaming up with 900AM WURD to moderate a panel about the changing neighborhood. The free event titled “Finding Tomorrow’s American Dream in Today’s East Mount Airy” will be hosted at Relish on Thursday from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. Drinks and appetizers will be provided to attendees.\nThe panel will include Councilwoman Cherelle Parker, Emily Dowdall of The Reinvestment Fund, East Mount Airy community leader Diane Richardson and Smith, who reported on the area for several months. The data and reporting found over Next City’s Philadelphia in Flux series will be presented at the discussion—with several solutions to keep the area going. Some of these solutions have already been noted in Next City’s series like foreclosure prevention clinics and other community-stabilization investments.\nAfter the panel discusses the findings, they’ll transition into an interactive conversation called a “Talk-Back.” Attendees will be able to ask questions from the panelists—and most importantly, propose their own solutions, Cohen said.\n“It’s always really interesting and fun for me to get a chance to meet new people from different parts of the city and hear about their experiences in the city and their solutions for solving whatever stresses they’re seeing in their community,” Cohen added.\nHeader photo via Google Maps"},{"url":"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/analysis/2017/03/23/e-coli-outbreak-linked-to-soynut-butters-sickens-nearly-2-dozen","title":"E. coli Outbreak Linked to SoyNut Butters Sickens More than 2 Dozen","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 23 people in nine states had been infected as of March 21 with a particularly dangerous strain of E. coli linked to I.M.

","date":"2017-03-04","full_text":"The headline and data in this analysis were updated on April 3, 2017 to reflect the most recent case count and investigation updates from the CDC.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 29 people in 12 states had been infected as of March 30 with a particularly dangerous strain of E. coli linked to I.M. Healthy brand SoyNut Butters and Granola products. Twenty-four of the reported victims are younger than 18, and 12 have been hospitalized. Nine have developed a type of kidney failure known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).\nAccording to the company’s announcement, which is posted on the Food and Drug Administration’s website, I.M. Healthy products from SoyNut Butter Co. in Glenview, Illinois, were distributed to child care centers and schools in multiple states. The CDC reports that four of those sickened attended centers where the products were served.\nThis outbreak is particularly alarming as young children exposed to E. coli are more likely to develop severe illness and HUS than are healthy adults, who can often recover relatively quickly. Children have less-developed immune systems with a limited ability to fight infections. In addition, children’s lower body weight reduces the amount of a pathogen needed to cause illness. There are many short- and long-term health consequences that can develop from infection with E. coli, including HUS, renal failure, coma, seizures, hypertension, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and even death.\nCongress has acted to modernize FDA’s food safety oversight system to reduce the likelihood of incidents like this one. But to prevent similar outbreaks and protect our food supply, it is imperative that FDA continue to implement the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and that Congress maintain its bipartisan commitment to fund this work. Thanks to the act, up to 300,000 facilities that process the food we eat have an affirmative, legally enforceable responsibility to take steps to prevent contamination of their products with E. coli and other pathogens that can sicken and even kill people. This requirement became effective for large operations in September 2016, and will begin to be enforced against midsize and smaller facilities over the next two years.\nAny delay in FSMA’s implementation due to insufficient funding or other factors could leave Americans at risk. Recognizing the large and urgent task before FDA, Congress has increased its food safety budget since 2011. As lawmakers consider spending bills for fiscal year 2017, they should continue to make FSMA implementation funding a priority. A wide range of food companies, retailers, and trade associations remains committed to the higher funding levels they previously approved. Last year, the House and Senate appropriations committees recommended additional funding of just over $33 million and $40 million, respectively, for FDA’s food safety programs. Adoption of these proposals in Congress’ final spending measure for fiscal 2017 will ensure that those responsible for keeping food safe have the resources to do the job effectively.\nSoon after completing fiscal 2017 spending legislation, Congress will begin writing appropriations bills for the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. Although the White House released a summary budget proposal on March 16, the document did not detail proposed funding levels for FDA. As the president and Congress detail their budget priorities for fiscal 2018, support for the agency’s critical food safety mission should not waver.\nSandra Eskin directs The Pew Charitable Trusts’ work on food safety."},{"url":"https://ensia.com/features/19036","title":"Fungal diseases are on the rise. Is environmental change to blame?","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Ensia","description":"Scientists and physicians are looking for clues to a worrying increase in fungal infections and exploring ways to reduce the threat.","date":"","full_text":"And some fungi are pathogens, causing disease in plants and animals, including humans. Throughout human history, fungal diseases have been pretty rare. Those that do arise tend to be only skin deep (think athlete’s foot or ringworm). Our complex immune systems and our hot bodies — most fungi can’t survive our internal temperatures — have largely protected us from major life-threatening fungal outbreaks.\n“We live in a sea of fungi, but probably less than 20 to 30 species are common pathogens in humans,” says John Perfect, an infectious disease specialist at Duke University.\nInvasive fungal infections — the really bad kind that infect the heart, blood, brain, bones and other internal organs — kill about 1.5 million people worldwide every year. According to some estimates, at least as many people die from the top 10 invasive fungal diseases as from tuberculosis or malaria. Perfect and other experts say these deadly diseases are on the rise. Some fungal pathogens that infect humans are emerging in parts of the world where they’ve never been found. In hospital patients, these life-threatening fungal infections are becoming more difficult to treat. Scientists and doctors are beginning to trace these worrying trends to human activity and changes in the environment, and working to figure out what we can do differently to reduce the threat.\nThe rise of human fungal infections coincided largely with the onset of the AIDS pandemic of the 1980s, says Robin May, a microbiologist at the University of Birmingham in the UK. Fungal diseases flourished in the severely immune-compromised population of people with AIDS. One fungal disease in particular — cryptococcosis — became an AIDs-defining illness in the 1980s. While the advent of antiretroviral therapy substantially reduced the number of people getting — and dying — from cryptococcosis, the disease remains a big problem in some parts of the world.\nThe main cause of the disease is a common fungus found in soils all over the world called Cryptococcus neoformans. In some people with cryptococcosis, the fungus invades the lungs, causing pneumonia and other breathing problems. In some cases it spreads to the nervous system and causes swelling around the brain. More than 1 million people with HIV/AIDS worldwide are affected with cryptococcal meningitis each year. The infection often is fatal in those with weakened immune systems, though it’s rare in people who are not immunocompromised.\nThen in 1999, doctors on Vancouver Island in Canada diagnosed six people with what appeared to be a more virulent strain of cryptoccosis. None of the infected individuals had medical conditions, such as HIV, that would weaken their immune systems. They were otherwise healthy.\nResearchers tracked the new infections to a different species of fungus — Cryptococcus gattii — a fungus that is more commonly found in the tropics. How the fungus made its way to Canada’s west coast is anybody’s guess. But it colonized its new, northern environment causing infections over the next decade in healthy individuals across the Pacific Northwest before starting to wane.\nThe emergence of C. gattii in the Pacific Northwest raised the notion that changes in climate could potentially increase the range of some fungal pathogens, according to May, who studies why some fungi are more harmful to humans than others. Researchers are now trying to understand how long-term changes in weather patterns — temperature or moisture, for instance — might impact human exposures to C. gattii and other fungal pathogens in the environment.\nLinks to Climate Change\nVery few fungi can survive extreme heat or freezing temperatures. Instead, most thrive in moist, temperate climates. As the world warms, that temperate range is increasing, says May. And the fungi are keeping pace.\nSome of the clearest reports come from agriculture, where fungi cause more than two-thirds of all crop diseases worldwide. “Major fungal diseases such as rice blast, wheat stem rust and corn smut challenge the global food supply,” says Sarah Gurr, chair in food security at the University of Exeter in the UK.\nShe and colleagues have shown in the northern hemisphere that fungal pests are shifting poleward at a rate of 7.6 kilometers (4.7 miles) per year. This means new fungal threats for some of the world’s most important grain producers, including the northern prairies of Europe and North America, says Gurr.\nFungal diseases are having their moment in wildlife too. Over the past 30 years, a chytrid fungus has led to the extinction of more than 200 species of frogs, leading to the greatest disease-caused loss of biodiversity in recorded history. Deadly white nose syndrome — named for the white fungal growth that characterizes it — has been spreading through bat populations in the eastern half of North America since 2007.\nFungal species can only cause disease if they can survive at host temperatures, explains Arturo Casadevall, a microbiologist and immunologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. Casadevall and others worry that global warming could drive the evolution of more heat-tolerant fungi — a change that could have big implications for human health.\n“A major factor protecting us from fungal disease is the difference in temperature between the human body and the outside environment. As fungi adapt to living at higher temperatures, we may begin to lose some of that natural protection,” says Casadevall. For a heat-tolerant fungus, the human body might start to look less like a sweltering furnace and more like a balmy retreat.\nCasadevall and colleagues have demonstrated that some fungi may already be adapting to warmer temperatures. When they analyzed thermal susceptibility data for several strains of yeast (a type of fungus) gathered since 1985, they found an increase in the past 20 years in the maximum temperature that some strains could withstand. The findings, say the researchers, are a “clear warning that global warming may cause fungi to become significantly more thermally resistant,” though it’s not possible yet to predict which species may become new human disease threats.\nNon-Environmental Factors\nThe rise in invasive fungal diseases may be due to a number of non-environmental factors too, including increased susceptibility due to medical procedures.\n“Advances in medicine have come with a few trade-offs, one of those being a rise in human fungal infections,” says Jack Edwards, a medical mycologist at Harbor/UCLA Medical Center in California. Edwards studies life-threatening infections due to yeast in hospitalized patients.\nThe CDC estimates there are roughly 46,000 cases of hospital-associated invasive candidiasis each year, a number that’s increased over the past two decades. It’s one of the most common bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients, and is caused by Candida yeasts that normally live in the gut and on the skin with few problems. But in patients with weakened immune systems — people on cancer chemotherapy or who have undergone an organ transplant, for instance — Candida can be a big problem, causing deaths in about 30 percent of patients with bloodstream infections.\n“Every time you take an antibiotic, you’re killing off some of the good bacteria in your gut that keep the growth of harmful organisms such as pathogenic yeast in check.” – John PerfectOveruse of antibiotics may be another factor leading to more life-threatening fungal infections. The human gut microbiome — the living things within our intestinal tract — consists of a few trillion organisms, including bacteria, viruses and even fungi. It’s a whole community of microscopic bugs — some of them helpful, some of them harmful. Our health depends on just the right balance.\nMost antibiotics don’t discriminate between good and bad bacteria, explains Perfect. “Every time you take an antibiotic, you’re killing off some of the good bacteria in your gut that keep the growth of harmful organisms such as pathogenic yeast in check,” he says.\nDrug Resistance\nInvasive fungal infections can be some of the trickiest medical problems to treat. A dearth of antifungal medications is one reason, says Edwards. There just aren’t a lot of drug options for preventing or treating fungal disease.\n“We have vaccines for parasites, viruses, bacteria. But no fungal vaccines,” says Edwards. He’s working with collaborators to develop a vaccine against candidiasis that could be given to transplant recipients, intensive care patients and others at high risk to prevent the life-threatening yeast infection.\nDrug-resistant fungal infections complicate the picture.\nSome experts fear that rampant use of single-target-site fungicides — chemicals with one very specific means of killing fungi — in agriculture could translate into more drug-resistant fungal infections in humans.\nIn Europe, the Americas and Asia, researchers have found drug-resistant strains of Aspergillus fumigatus in garden soil, plant seeds, rice fields and compost. The fungus causes a disease called aspergillosis, which can cause breathing problems in both immune-suppressed and healthy people.\nThe discovery of drug-resistant aspergillosis in patients who have never before taken antifungal medications suggests that drug resistance in some cases could be coming from the environment and not from previous use of antifungals, says Gurr.\nShe says we should limit use of agricultural fungicides that are structurally similar to medically important antifungal medications. More research is needed too, she says, on the basic life cycle of fungal plant pathogens.

Lighted bracelets were blinking, celebrities were sighted (Rhianna, Jay Z, Marshawn Lynch), there were long lines for libations and bro hugs between the players during warm-ups.\nBut that festive mood vanished as soon as the ball was tipped and the game got under way. The arena immediately filled with a thick intensity, a competitive heat emanating off the players on the floor. From the opening seconds, every shot was contested, every rebound a battle.\nThis felt less like Game 1 of the 2017 NBA Finals and more like Game 8 of last June’s series. As though a full year hadn’t elapsed, as though all the emotion from last year’s Game 7 poured directly into Thursday night.\nThis was not a “feeling out” opening game. This was a “we know you and you know us” declaration game. And the Warriors were the team making the statement, pummeling the Cleveland Cavaliers 113-91.\n“They’re the best I’ve ever seen,” Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said. He had a smirk when he said it but he repeated it.\n“No team has done this before, right?” he asked.\nThat’s right. The Warriors are 13-0 this postseason. After a game like Thursday’s, the possibility of doing the unthinkable, going undefeated — four, four, four, four — throughout the playoffs will be raised.\nBut one expects Lue is using that praise as a prod to goose his proud team. The Cavaliers will adjust. They came back from a 3-1 deficit last June. Few are predicting a Warriors cakewalk.\n“There’s no time to be disappointed,” said Cavs point guard Kyrie Irving. “There’s a lot of things we can correct.”\nThe Cavaliers and Warriors are making history. For the first time in NBA history and the first time in more than half a century in the four major pro sports, two teams are meeting for a third straight championship. The Warriors won the first, the Cavaliers the second, so this — the third in the trilogy — is truly the rubber match. The grudge match.\nThere’s so much on the line, so much to prove. These two heavyweights have been waiting to trade blows since last season ended on the same floor at Oracle. In a joyous celebration for the Cavaliers. In a distressing heartbreaker for the Warriors, who went ice cold in the final minutes of Game 7.\nThat epic loss spurred the Warriors to go out and sign Kevin Durant, morphing from cute newcomer to Super Villain. The addition of Durant prompted the Cavaliers to go out and strengthen their supporting cast.\nWhen asked what stood out to him about the Warriors, LeBron James had a simple answer.\n“KD,” he said.\nOther than personnel changes, the biggest difference between last year’s iteration of this matchup and now is the increased level of intensity. The deepening of the rivalry. The hardening of the grudges, the rewinding of memories, the fermenting of emotions.\nAnd you could sense that immediately, from the moment the ball was tipped.\nDurant in particular played like a man with a point to prove, a wish to fulfill, an internet to quiet. He was spectacular, the best player on the court — and that includes LeBron James. Too often for the Cavaliers’ liking, he found a wide-open lane and flew to the basket. He added eight assists to his 38 points.\n“I just tried to do my part,” he said, “stay locked in on both ends and have some fun out there.”\nStephen Curry, who needed redemption after last year’s poor Game 7 performance, was also dazzling. He and Durant — who once were expected not to work well together — combined for 66 points and 18 assists.\nDraymond Green, whose on-court antics in 2016 led to a Game 5 suspension and caused many of the Warriors’ momentum problems, was at his best: emotional, passionate but fully in control. The bench was solid, the maligned centers — Zaza Pachulia, who was vilified by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, and JaVale McGee, whose basketball smarts were anonymously called into question by the Cavaliers — were key contributors. The team had only four turnovers to the Cavaliers’ 20.\nIn other words, it was all good for the Warriors. Including the fact that Mike Brown, their acting head coach, has now led them to an 11-0 record. Brown, who was fired twice by Cleveland, became the first Finals coach to be paid by both teams on the floor. Steve Kerr, unable to coach because of his ongoing chronic pain, addressed the team. But, even with Kerr only behind the scenes, his vision was being fully executed on the floor.\nThe Warriors pulled away at the start of the third quarter. By the fourth quarter, the air inside Oracle had lightened. The outcome of this opening game was already decided.\nIt had evolved from Game 8 back into a normal Game 1, just the first step of the series.\nBut it is going to be intense, every step of the way.\nAnn Killion is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.

","date":"","full_text":"In the process of making his announcement that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accords, President Donald Trump appeared to cite scientific findings by MIT about the impact the pact would have. Not so fast, the researchers said.\nTrump said in his Rose Garden speech that even if the climate agreement were fully implemented, “it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree -- think of that; this much -- Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount.”\nTalking points issued by the White House said, “According to researchers at MIT, if all member nations met their obligations, the impact on the climate would be negligible. The impacts have been estimated to be likely to reduce global temperature rise by less than .2 degrees Celsius in 2100.’’\nBut MIT said the statement was misleading.\n“The relevant MIT researchers believe that the Paris agreement is an unprecedented and vital effort by nearly 200 countries to respond to the urgent threat of global climate change,” MIT said in a statement Thursday evening.\nJohn Sterman, an MIT researcher who works to analyze climate change scenarios, and Andrew Jones, a researcher with the think tank Climate Interactive, told the Washington Post that their analysis shows that the current country level pledges under the Paris agreement would reduce the planet’s warming by the year 2100 down from 4.2 degrees Celsius (7.56 degrees Fahreheit) to 3.3 degrees Celsius (5.94 degrees Fahrenheit), or nearly a full degree.\nThe co-founder of the MIT program on climate change told The Associated Press that the administration was citing an outdated report, taken out of context. Jake Jacoby said the actual global impact of meeting targets under the Paris accord would be to curb rising temperatures by 1 degree Celsius (or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit).\n‘‘They found a number that made the point they want to make,’’ Jacoby said. ‘‘It’s kind of a debate trick.’’\nMIT Technology Review reported that the “two-tenths of one degree” number cited by Trump appears to have come from a 2014 study by the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, not a 2016 study cited by the White House.\nThat 2014 study didn’t include all the eventual commitments to cut emissions by nations or assume that the pledges would continue beyond 2030.\n“This idea that the Paris agreement has a negligible impact on future climate change is certainly not what we conveyed and was not the conclusion of our analysis. We make clear that if we want to limit warming to 2 °C, we need to do more and we need continued effort past 2030,” said Erwan Monier, co-author of the study and principal research scientist at the university’s department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences.\nMartin Finucane of the Globe staff contributed to this report."},{"url":"http://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/29/veterans-suicide-line/353275001","title":"It's been a year.

The crisis line was established in 2007 and operates at its own site at Canandaigua Veterans Affairs Medical Center here with an additional center in Atlanta that opened in October 2016.\nThe VA estimates that the crisis line has answered close to 2.8 million calls since it was launched and initiated emergency services more than 74,000 times.\n► March 30: When veterans become cops, some bring war home\n► March 20: VA suicide hotline still riddled with problems, investigation finds\nThe Veterans Health Administration was scheduled to put recommendations in place for the crisis line by September and then asked for an extension to March — a deadline it also hasn't met. The report from the Veterans Affairs' Office of the Inspector General released March 20 found that the agency's \"failure to implement our previous recommendations impairs the VCL's ability to increase the quality of crisis intervention services to veterans seeking help.\"\nAdditional findings:\n• The crisis line did not respond adequately to a veteran's urgent need.\n• Crisis line workers continue to poorly manage incoming phone calls.\n• Governance and oversight of the Veterans Crisis Line's operations also continue to be deficient.\nOne veteran's interaction with the crisis line and backup centers led the Office of Inspector General to identify problems with manually writing down of callers' numbers, a lack of process to review adverse outcomes, an inability to record calls and an inability to track the performance of the backup call centers that take calls when counselors in Canandaigua are busy with other veterans.\nAnd follow-up was lax, according to the most recent evaluation from the Office of Inspector general.\n► March 14: Petraeus, other ex-generals oppose bill to let mentally ill vets get guns\n► Dec. 24: Vet with PTSD 'saw life' in puppy present\n\"VCL leaders did not collect data regarding attempted or completed suicides following a veteran's contact with the VCL,\" the report indicated. Nor did crisis line leadership review or debrief staff if veterans who had been in contact attempted or committed suicide.\nVA Inspector General Michael Missal acknowledged staff members' dedication but said in a statement accompanying the release of the report: \"It is imperative that VA take further steps to increase effectiveness of VCL operations.\"\nThe crisis center has had no permanent leadership since June when the director appointed after a shakeup following the February 2016 report resigned four months later, said the most recent report and further information from the Military Times in June.\n► Dec. 7: Mental health advocates celebrate passage of 21st Century Cures Act\n► Dec. 1: Free clinics aim to fill VA’s shortfalls in mental health\nThe March 20 report makes an additional 16 recommendations intended to address the ongoing deficiencies including these:\n• Hold backup call centers to the same standards as the Veterans Crisis Line in New York.\n• Develop more robust reporting of the clinical outcomes.\n• Use an automated transcription function for callers' phone numbers.\n• Review data on outcomes.\nThe problems continued in part because of the October launch of the additional call center in Atlanta that redeployed Canandaigua staff to provide training.\nThe VA estimate that the crisis line handles half a million calls a year — in addition to texts and emails — space requirements in upstate New York and recruitment pool limitations created the decision to expand to a second site.\n► July 7: 20 veterans a day committed suicide in 2014, new data show\n► June 12: Experts worry high military suicide rates are 'new normal'\nIn a statement delivered to an April 27 Senate hearing on preventing veteran suicide, Missal said that bringing Atlanta up contributed to a delay in developing procedures, including deferring annual lethality-assessment training for responders.\nLethality assessments gauge a caller's potential for suicide.\n\"Lack of formal planning and inaccurate forecasting resulted in more than 16,000 hours of Canandaigua FTE (full–time equivalent) employees being temporarily redirected to the Atlanta call center for training and operations,\" Missal said. That's the equivalent of 100 employees working 40 hours a week for four weeks to train Atlanta staff.\n\"This led to an increase in the number of calls that rolled over to backup centers and delays in the development and implementation of VCL processes, policies, and procedures,\" he said.\nThe report showed that the crisis line's November rollover rate, the number of inbound calls that staff did not answer, was close to 30%.\n\"Backup call centers historically have placed VCL rollover calls into a queue without immediately providing service or risk assessment,\" the VA Office of Inspector General found.Veterans Affairs' acting under secretary for health, Dr. Poonam L. Alaigh, agreed with the latest report and all 16 inspector general recommendations. She outlined a list of responses with target dates from May to December of this year.\nVeterans, their friends and family and military personnel can communicate with the Veterans Crisis Line confidentially in three ways.\n1.

And dog owners aren't going quietly.","date":"","full_text":"Shirlington Dog Park in South Arlington attracts canines and their two-legged friends from across the Washington region. The popular space is one of the largest dog parks in the area, with more than 100,000 square feet and a stream where dogs can play. Now, the park is at risk of being downsized to less than half its current space under an Arlington County redevelopment plan.\nThe plan, called the Four Mile Run Valley Initiative, would alter the industrial and commercial area along Four Mile Run Drive between S. Walter Reed and Shirlington Roads as well as Jennie Dean Park and Shirlington Dog Park.\nThree alternatives have been put forward for the park, including one that would reduce it to as little as 27,000 square feet. The two other proposals, known as Alternative 2A and Alternative 2B, would cut the park to 47,000 and 55,000 square feet, respectively.\n“You’re not going to cut the number of people in half,” said Kim Houghton, owner of Wag More Dogs, a pet grooming shop located at the park entrance on S. Oxford Street. “You’re just going to slam them into the smaller space.”\nThe details were presented to community members and a county-board appointed working group in mid-May. That group has been tasked with giving feedback and guidance to county staff and the board.\nHoughton is among those who regularly attend the monthly meetings. Like other concerned residents in the room, she openly voiced her opinion to the working group, but she was disappointed in the response.\n“They weren’t even listening,” Houghton said.\nLisa Grandle, park development provision chief for the Arlington County Department of Parks and Recreation, said the county understands the community connection with the dog park. She added that there are some environmental problems, and the dog park will need to comply with stormwater management regulations.\n“There are runoff issues and some challenges with the existing surfaces,” Grandle explained. “If it tries to stay within the existing footprint, and we do the things that we’re required to do from a stormwater regulation standpoint, like providing a vegetated buffer, that would reduce the size.”\nGrandle also says that concerns about the dog park’s future are premature. The redevelopment of Shirlington Dog Park is part of the working group’s wider look at the area; there is currently no funding to support the project. Even if funding is obtained in the next fiscal year’s capital improvement program, according to Grandle it would still be several years before the work begins.\nThere is, however, an imminent proposed plan to redevelop a yet undetermined portion of the commercial area near Jennie Dean Park, turning it into green space.\nThose in loud opposition of changes to the dog park have signed an online petition, which is steadily nearing its goal of 2,500 supporters. Some have also joined the Save Shirlington Dog Park Facebook group.\n“A lot of people are like don’t touch it. Maintain it, take care of it, but don’t do any major alterations,” Houghton said.\nThe county board will be presented with the plans for the first time at a work session on Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 7:00 p.m. at Courthouse Plaza. The next formal update for community members will be held in July."},{"url":"https://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2017/05/30/good-things-small-packages-five-summer-music-festivals-that-wont-break-the-bank","title":"Good Things, Small Packages: Five Summer Music Festivals That Won’t Break the Bank","author_text":null,"keywords":["Festivals","Guide"],"publication_text":"KQED Arts","description":"Looking to get your fest on without draining your savings account?

Do you thrive on the act of snaking your way through a crowd 200,000 strong to find your friends at Outside Lands?\nIf that’s a hard no, no and no, thank you, you’re not alone. Upwards of 32 million people now attend music festivals in the U.S. — and if you’re currently recovering from this year’s BottleRock, more power to you! But not everyone loves a massive festival. For example: people who can’t afford to spend half their month’s rent on a wristband that gets you access to slightly nicer than usual Port-a-Pottys.\nLuckily, if you don’t have the dough or can’t stomach the crowds, that doesn’t mean you need to skip out on music festivals entirely. Here are a handful of fests that won’t break the bank (these all clock in at $50 or under for a single-day ticket) or lead to large crowd-induced panic attacks (I am not a doctor).\nJune 9–10 at Gundlach Bundschu Winery, Sonoma\nSet among a picturesque 300-acre vineyard in the foothills of the Mayacamas Mountains, this festival would be a charmer even without a great lineup — but it has that too. Booked by (((folkYEAH!))), this fest’s bill is an annual who’s-who in sun-baked West Coast indie music: The Allah-La’s bring psychedelic desert twang up from L.A.; the Mattson 2 reinterpret Coltrane’s A Love Supreme through a beachy 2017 filter; Christopher Owens’ new band Curls brings, well, Christopher Owens being inscrutably Christopher Owens-like. Others to check out: Tara Jane O’Neil, San Francisco’s own Heron Oblivion and Cool Ghouls, and Marty O’Reilly, from Santa Cruz. Tickets ($40 and up) here.\nJune 16–18 at the Peg House, Leggett\nI almost feel bad writing about this festival in Standish Hickey State Park, about 200 miles north of San Francisco, because its charm lies in how small, laid-back and idyllic it feels — the last thing I’d want, as the kids say, is to blow up its spot. But that’s what Oakland indie-pop singer Ash Reiter gets for organizing a fest around a single wooden stage, with yoga every morning, a trippy liquid light show every night, a general store with great breakfast burritos, and a campground and a swimming hole on the Eel River a stone’s throw away. The sounds of Oakland dominate this bill, including punky doo-wop staples Shannon and the Clams, electro-soul from the Seshen, dreamy psych jams from Meerna, and more. Tickets ($50 and up) here.\nJune 17 at Potrero del Sol Park, San Francisco\nNow in its seventh year, this one-day food, beer and music party thrown by The Bay Bridged packs a lot into roughly seven hours — and this year’s lineup is maybe the best yet, in large part thanks to a strong showing from women: The Coathangers bring cathartic yet danceable punk rock from Atlanta, while a trio of locals — R\u0026B singer Rayana Jay, indie-pop buzz machine Jay Som, and dreamy shoegaze purveyor Madeline Kenney — make the lineup’s finer print the cool place to be. Oh yeah, and Thee Oh Sees are playing too. Pro tip: This festival’s food truck lineup is nearly as hotly anticipated each year as the music. Come hungry. Tickets ($29 and up) here.\nAug. 11–13, Downtown San Jose\nWith 10 stages throughout downtown San Jose, this annual celebration handily reflects the diversity of the genre, with blues, R\u0026B, funk, salsa and other Latin music represented alongside jazz from all corners of the globe. Big names like saxoponist Maceo Parker, Parliament Funkadelic and Hammond B-3 organ legend Dr. Lonnie Smith appear at this smorgasbord of a fest alongside emerging local talent, like the fast-rising Oakland singer Kalil Wilson. With more than 100 performances — both indoor and outdoor — over the course of three days, this is one of those elusive musical situations where there might actually be something for everyone. Tickets ($20 and up) here.\nSept. 4, around 3rd and Chestnut Streets, Oakland\nThe only festival I feel comfortable recommending before the lineup’s even announced, Hiero Day is an annual Labor Day weekend gift to the community from Hieroglyphics, the hip-hop collective that defined the sound of East Bay hip-hop in the ’90s. What began as a free, feel-good block party in Oakland’s oft-overlooked Acorn neighborhood in 2012 has grown in the past couple years into a legitimate festival, with ever-better lineups (featuring both rap veterans and up-and-comers), increased ticket prices and, yes, the infrastructure problems that come with a party everyone wants to attend. (Last year’s festival saw at least one major safety issue from overcrowding.) Still, by the time the sun starts to set and Souls of Mischief emerge to perform their classic “93 ’til Infinity,” it’s hard to beat the mood here. It’s a Town party through and through. Tickets ($19.93 and up last year) here.\n(Video by our friend and colleague Alex Ghassan, whom we miss very much.)"},{"url":"http://www.wnyc.org/story/four-signs-south-bronx-gentrifying","title":"Four Signs the South Bronx Is Gentrifying","author_text":null,"keywords":["Npr","New York","Wnyc","Arts","Culture","News","Public","Radio"],"publication_text":"WNYC","description":"WNYC is exploring New York City's affordability crisis one neighborhood at a time, starting with Mott Haven in the South ...","date":"","full_text":"This year, WNYC is taking a close look at New York City's affordability crisis, one neighborhood at a time. And we're starting in Mott Haven in the South Bronx. It's a community that's struggled for decades with crime and poverty. But like much of New York, it's gentrifying. Here are some of the tell-tale signs.\n1. Developers are staking a claim\nSomerset Partners and the Chetrit Group have bought up old warehouses along an industrial stretch of the Harlem River waterfront, just like developers did in Dumbo and Williamsburg years ago. They're planning six residential towers plus restaurants, a coffee shop, beer garden, food hall and boutique nearby. \"We want to respect the heritage of the community, the people and at the same time provide opportunities for individuals and families both existing in the community and new to the community,\" said Somerset partner Keith Rubenstein.\n2. Artists and millennials are moving in\nGalleries are sprouting up along the waterfront, and the new coffee shop is a hub for recent college grads who've been priced out of other boroughs. Developer Rubenstein has partnered with designer Jerome Lamaar to open a boutique. Lamaar says he wants to do for the Bronx what Jay Z has done for Brooklyn. \"My goal is to make it into a hub for creativity, because I love art, I love fashion, I love culture,\" he said. \"So for me this is a representation of the way I've always seen the Bronx.\"\n3. Housing costs are spiking\nNYU's Furman Center recently listed Mott Haven among the city's top gentrifying neighborhoods, with rents up 28 percent since the '90s. Rowhouses are being snatched up at foreclosure auctions, renovated and flipped. And residents are worried about getting pushed out. \"It's real good to live in the Bronx, but the rent is crazy,\" said lifelong resident Sonia Santiago. \"Maybe they want to move these people and bring the white people.\"\n4. Community leaders are mobilizing\nDeveloper Rubenstein and his partners got flak for trying to rebrand the neighborhood The Piano District, after the old piano factories that used to be there. Then many community members were outraged when he hosted a party for celebrities and local politicians a year ago that had burning trash cans and bullet-riddled cars as decor. Most recently, he teamed up with Bronx-born producer Swizz Beatz for an art show that was criticized for failing to include enough local and Latino artists. Rubenstein says he didn't mean to offend anyone, and is committed to working with the community. But Ed Garcia Conde who writes the blog Welcome2TheBronx calls it the Columbus effect. \"First you think, 'Oh that's nice, that we are no longer being overlooked,'\" he said. \"Then all of a sudden you realize this isn't for us. This isn't for anyone who lives in the Bronx. This is clearly for people from Manhattan or Brooklyn who are being pushed out of other boroughs.\"\nFor the next few months, WNYC producer Sophia Paliza-Carre will be at the Mott Haven Library to hear your thoughts.

The president interrupts his briefers with questions but also with random asides. He asks that the top brass of the intelligence community be present, and he demands brevity.\nAs they huddle around the desk, Trump likes to pore over visuals — maps, charts, pictures and videos, as well as “killer graphics,” as CIA Director Mike Pompeo phrased it.\n“That’s our task, right? To deliver the material in a way that he can best understand the information we’re trying to communicate,” said Pompeo, adding that he, too, prefers to “get to the core of the issue quickly.”\nYet there are signs that the president may not be retaining all the intelligence he is presented, fully absorbing its nuance, or respecting the sensitivities of the information and how it was gathered.\nEarlier this month, for instance, Trump bragged to top Russian diplomats about the quality of the intelligence and revealed highly classified information, related to the fight against the Islamic State, that had been shared by a U.S. partner.\n“I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,” Trump told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during their May 10 meeting in the Oval Office, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the exchange.\nHe recently — despite all evidence to the contrary — said that perhaps China, not Russia, had tried to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. And during a meeting in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, the president seemed to effectively confirm that the private information he divulged to the Russian diplomats came from Israel.\n“Just so you understand, I never mentioned the word or the name Israel,” Trump told reporters, responding to a question no one had asked. “Never mentioned it during that conversation.”\nIn March, the president also pressured two of the nation’s top intelligence officials to help him publicly push back against the FBI investigation into possible collusion between the Russian government and his campaign, a request both men felt was inappropriate.\nThis portrait of Trump as a consumer of the nation’s secrets is based on interviews with several senior administration officials who regularly attend his briefings. Some of the interviews were conducted in early May, before the president’s meeting with the Russians.\nTrump’s posture toward the intelligence community and its work product has evolved in the months since he was sworn in as president.\nBefore his inauguration, Trump spoke of U.S. spy agencies with contempt. He sent demeaning tweets accusing intelligence officials of behaving as though they were in “Nazi Germany,” and he assailed them for what he said were “disgraceful” leaks to the media regarding Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.\nIntelligence officials were prepared to deliver daily briefings to Trump throughout the transition period, but the president-elect often turned them away, usually agreeing to sit for briefings only once or twice per week.\n“You know, I’m, like, a smart person. I don’t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,” Trump told Fox News last December.\nPresident Barack Obama offered a retort when he later appeared on “The Daily Show.”\n“It doesn’t matter how smart you are,” Obama said. “. . . If you’re not getting their perspective, their detailed perspective, then you are flying blind.”\nAs president, Trump now takes briefings nearly every day. In a White House with few steadying mechanisms — and one led by a Washington neophyte who bristles at structure and protocol — the daily intelligence briefing is the rare constant.\nThe sessions often run past their scheduled time, stretching for 30 or 45 minutes, prompting Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to pop into the Oval Office to cut off the discussion: “Mr. President, we’ve got people backing up outside.”\n“A president who I think came into the office thinking he would focus on domestic issues — ‘make America great again’ — has learned that you inherit the world and its problems when you’re president of the United States,” said Daniel Coats, director of national intelligence and a frequent participant in Trump’s briefings.\n“One time he came in and said, ‘All right, what’s the bad news this morning?’ ” Coats added. “You can see the weight of the burden on the shoulders of the president.”\nYet while Pompeo and Coats praise the intelligence-consuming habits of the president who appointed them, Trump’s standing among career intelligence officers remains strained. He has continued to disparage their motives and work — most notably by refusing to accept the consensus of the CIA, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that Russia waged an unprecedented effort to disrupt the 2016 election. In a recent television interview, Trump said that it “could have been China, could have been a lot of different groups.”\nAnd Trump’s reaction to the disclosure that he shared highly classified information with Russian officials was to declare it his “absolute right” to do so and lash out at leakers — making clear that he still sees his own intelligence services as adversaries.\nShortly after taking the oath of office, Trump visited CIA headquarters and delivered a freewheeling speech in which he boasted that “probably almost everybody in this room voted for me,” while standing in front of the agency’s sacred memorial wall that honors employees killed in the line of duty.\nMark Lowenthal, a former assistant director of the CIA and the president of the Intelligence and Security Academy, said Trump’s biggest challenge is his “lack of previous exposure” to sensitive intelligence.\n“Pompeo and Coats are doing their best to give him the most accurate daily briefing, but my sense is in the rank-and-file, they are very worried about how do you deal with him and about sharing with him sensitive material,” Lowenthal said. “This is the result of his behavior, both during the campaign and that visit to the CIA, which was a disaster, and now the whole Russia briefing.”\nStill, Trump tells advisers that he values his daily briefings. Though career intelligence analysts often take the lead in delivering them, Trump likes his political appointees — Pompeo and Coats — to attend, along with national security adviser H.R. McMaster. Pompeo and Coats, whose offices are in McLean, Va., have had to redesign their daily routines so that they spend many mornings at the White House.\nVice President Pence usually attends, while other administration principals join depending on the topic of the day, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly. Senior members of the West Wing staff sometimes float in and out of the Oval Office during the briefings.\nJared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, often observes quietly; he receives his own intelligence briefing earlier in the morning, according to two White House officials. Some Democrats are now calling for Kushner’s security clearance to be reviewed after The Washington Post reported Friday that he attempted to set up back-channel communications with the Russian government during the presidential transition.\nThe briefings are tailored around events on the president’s schedule. For example, if a foreign leader is visiting, Trump will receive information pertinent to that country, often delivered by a subject-area expert.\nIntelligence officials said they use the briefings in part to impress upon a president who has viewed their community with skepticism the breadth and depth of the government’s espionage capabilities.\nTrump prefers free-flowing conversations over listening to his briefers teach lessons. “It’s a very oral, interactive discussion, as opposed to sitting there and reading from a text or a script,” Pompeo said.\nPompeo added: “He always asks hard questions, which I think is the sign of a good intelligence consumer. He’ll challenge analytic lines that we’ll present, which is again completely appropriate. . . . It is frequently the case that we’ll find that we need to go back and do more work to develop something, to round something out.”\nTrump will task his briefers with returning the next day with more information about a particular subject, or will turn to McMaster and say, “General, give me more information,” according to Coats.\nPresidents have received daily intelligence updates for more than 50 years, usually in written form as the President’s Daily Brief, as the classified document is known. The “briefing book” is designed to provide a summary from all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies of key security developments and insights, in the United States and abroad.\nThe ways in which presidents have processed the material have varied greatly, based on their preferences. For instance, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush favored daily in-person oral briefings, according to David Priess, a former intelligence officer and CIA briefer. Some presidents read materials in narrative form, while others preferred shorter updates known as “snowflakes,” he said.\n“The President’s Daily Brief is adapted to the personality and the style of each president,” said Priess, author of “The President’s Book of Secrets.” “It can be longer; it can be shorter. It can have greater sourcing information; it can have thinner sourcing information. It can have in-depth assessments; it can have virtual tweets.”\nWhen he took office, Trump signaled to his national security team that he favors concise points boiled down to a single page.\n“I like bullets or I like as little as possible,” he said in a pre-inaugural interview with Axios. “I don’t need, you know, 200-page reports on something that can be handled on a page.”\nTrump also has encouraged his briefers to include as many visual elements as possible. This is a reflection, aides said, of Trump’s career as a real estate developer who evaluated blueprints and renderings to visualize what a property eventually would look like.\n“Sometimes,” Coats said, “pictures do say a thousand words.”\nGreg Miller contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/05/british-general-election-labour-party-railroad-nationalization/528459","title":"Should Britain Nationalize its Railways?","author_text":"Feargus O'Sullivan ","keywords":[],"publication_text":"CityLab","description":"The Labour Party’s promise to end private ownership of rail services finds broad appeal across the U.K.","date":"","full_text":"As Britain’s Labour Party closes the gap with its Conservative rivals in the June 8th general election, there’s at least one part of the party’s platform that’s widely popular: nationalizing the railways.\nAccording to the party’s manifesto, a Labour government would end the outsourcing of passenger services to private companies, a practice that began in 1994. The idea might seem complex and expensive, but it has become a significant feature of Britain’s current election campaign—and it’s an idea that many U.K. citizens seem to like a lot: A recent survey found 52 percent of respondents favored renationalization, versus 22 percent against. That makes the idea currently more popular than the party that proposed it.\nIt’s just one part of a broader proposal to create national energy, mail, and utility companies if Labour is elected—and that’s no small “if.” Despite recent poll jumps suggesting a close race on the 8th, Britain’s Conservatives are still favored to win, and nationalization has no place in their agenda.\nStill, Labour’s proposal is striking for its popularity. But is it feasible?\nThe short answer is yes, the long answer is maybe. A state takeover might be easier than it sounds, because Britain’s train companies aren’t truly private enterprises. Britain’s railways currently have a fiddly, tripartite structure that already mixes public and private ownership. In a vital difference from the United States, the tracks are still owned by the state, via a body called Network Rail. The trains are owned by private companies known as ROSCOs, or rolling stock companies. Actual passenger services, meanwhile, are run by another set of private companies, including Virgin Trains, Arriva UK Trains, and Abellio ScotRail, among others who bid to run services on five- to seven-year leases granted by the government.\nThis means that “renationalizing” Britain’s railways could actually be quite simple. Many current operators are on contracts that run out by 2020. The government would simply need to wait for these leases to expire before replacing their current operators with a unified state alternative. More expensive and complex would be creating a public rolling stock company, which would probably mean buying out a private operator at considerable cost.\nBy some metrics, Britain’s railways aren’t doing so badly at all.\nRailroad privatization has long been a hot-button issue in U.K. politics. When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sold off many government-run enterprises in the 1980s, she reportedly considered private rail as a step too far. Ever since her successor John Major broke up British Rail into a constellation of private companies in 1994, the performance of Britain’s railways has been decidedly mixed. That a reversal is even being considered is a record of the failures—at least in public perception—of the whole process.\nDespite the promise that competition would open up the rail market, passenger services have remained within the control of a small clique of transit companies. As Nicole Badstuber, a transit researcher at University College London notes, this has led to a situation where private companies profit without providing a truly free marketplace.\n“Railways aren't a free-market good, they're a natural monopoly most people are locked into where they live and only have one train operator to get them to work,” Badstuber tells CityLab. “There's no real competition there and if prices go up, you're stuck with them. The current franchise arrangements also don’t really promote investment in the system. What they promote is extracting value and as much profit in the 5- to 7-years franchise period.”\nThere’s also a curious trans-European twist to Britain’s privatized rail system. Many of the passenger companies are joint ventures with, or offshoots of, European rail companies that remain in public hands. Arriva Trains, for example, is owned by Germany’s Deutsche Bahn, while Abellio Scotrail is a subsidiary of Dutch national carrier Nederlandse Spoorwegen. Both of these companies charge lower fares in their domestic market (despite Britain’s flexible pricing offering some bargains) leading to accusations that profits skimmed from privatized British rail are essentially a subsidy for more affordable public fares on the European mainland.\nMeanwhile Britain’s government continues to pump subsidies of around £4 billion ($5.1 billion) annually into the system, while train companies pay out up to £200 million ($256 million) to shareholders annually. The image of the private companies has also been marred by high-profile failures, notably the poor services provided by rail services around London, damned last week as the worst since the rail watchdog was founded 14 years ago.\nRelated Stories\nWhether nationalizing rail would radically change this situation is still an open question. By some metrics, Britain’s railways aren’t doing so badly at all. When it comes to punctuality, frequency, and station quality, customer satisfaction is actually fairly high in Britain compared to other European countries. Passenger numbers have also grown considerably since privatization. As Sim Harris, managing editor of transit magazine Rail News, tells CityLab, any system that’s seen so much ridership growth is likely to experience strain regardless of its ownership status.\n“There are roughly twice as many passengers on the railways as there were 20 years ago, but we don't have twice as much railway, and we certainly don't have twice as many trains running,” he says. “If you take the number of trains timetabled in 1997 at an index of 100, the number of trains timetabled [today] gives you an index of 129. We've got nearly a third more trains running, but we're carrying twice the number of people. Plainly some trains, if not all, are going to be busier than they used to be.”\nCreating a more joined-up, fully state-owned system where franchises didn’t break off every five to seven years could provide more consistency, while retaining profits currently skimmed off by rail operators could feasibly lower fares or improve infrastructure. But the task of managing the huge and growing volume of rail passengers in Britain cannot be solved by nationalization alone.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the owner of Britain’s rail tracks."},{"url":"https://theconversation.com/when-trump-met-nato-blunt-talk-and-meaningful-silences-78444","title":"When Trump met NATO: Blunt talk and meaningful silences","author_text":"Simon Reich","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Conversation","description":"Candidate Donald Trump called NATO 'obsolete.' Since becoming president he has reversed that view, but what he said – and didn't say – during his recent visit will not have put NATO leaders at ease.","date":"","full_text":"Donald Trump’s electoral campaign was notable for his abrasive statements and blunt assessments about a variety of issues. Among his more unforgettable claims was his suggestion that NATO was “obsolete.”\nThis comment was largely founded, it seems, on a lack of understanding about what NATO does or how it functions. Since 1949, NATO has been a bedrock of American foreign policy, first in Europe against the Soviet Union and its allies, and then in Afghanistan. Trump’s desire to build bridges with the Russians, and his plain ignorance about NATO’s contribution in the war against the Taliban, largely explains his startling claim.\nBut what interests me as a keen observer of NATO politics is what Trump’s encounter with the other NATO leaders reveals about their relationship. And what will he claim about that meeting on his return?\nA reeducation\nAs in many other policy areas, some quick tutoring led Trump to completely reverse his position. Key to that education was undoubtedly Defense Secretary James Mattis, who reportedly told the German defense minister soon after Trump’s inauguration that NATO remained the “central pillar” of transatlantic security and commented in congressional testimony that Russia remained America’s number one security threat.\nSo Mattis himself, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson all traveled to Europe in the first 100 days of the Trump administration to reassure NATO allies about the organization’s continued importance. This sentiment was reinforced by General Curtis M. Scaparrotti, the current supreme allied commander Europe.\nBy April, Trump had issued a predictably blunt edict in which he reversed course: “I said it was obsolete. It is no longer obsolete.”\nStill, for many of us, a subsequent visit to see those we’d publicly criticized would be awkward. But just like his meeting with Pope Francis, Trump again demonstrated an amazing capacity to shrug off his earlier statements without any outward sign of embarrassment – while simultaneously asserting an authoritative tone.\nThe discussions in Brussels may have been more symbolic than substantial. But Trump’s ability to assume a claim of leadership – and success – was helped by two developments.\nClaiming a victory on NATO financing\nFirst, Trump chastised other NATO members, reiterating his demand that they contribute more to NATO’s common defense.\nSince the end of the Cold War, the size of the U.S. defense budget has varied, but expenditures always stayed above 2 percent of GDP. At the same time, however, most European budget expenditures haven’t. At NATO’s 2014 summit, NATO members agreed to target spending 2 percent of their GDP on defense.\nOf the 27 other NATO members, only four currently meet the threshold. And of those, only Britain has a substantial military capability. Most pointedly, Germany has significantly underspent on defense. The fact that the 2 percent threshold doesn’t formally have to be met until 2024 is one of those minor facts that Trump conveniently ignores.\nBut this issue has been a longstanding squabble. In a rare example of bilateral consensus, Trump echoed the sentiment of both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in demanding that they pay more. And, he added,\n“This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States and many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and [from] not paying in those past years.”\nTrump will surely characterize just bluntly voicing his concerns as a victory. And the vague promises of NATO members, particularly Germany, to increase their contributions to the common defense will reinforce that claim. The outcome, he will insist, is consistent with his campaign pledge – that he is getting a good deal for Americans.\nClaiming a victory on terror\nThe second development in Brussels is an agreement that NATO would focus more on the fight against Islamic terrorism. This was formally reflected in the statement, calling terrorism “a challenge that the international community must tackle together.”\nI imagine that Trump will undoubtedly again claim credit.\nThe Germans and French called this move “symbolic.” And, in some ways, they are right. The British and French are already deeply involved in the fight against terrorism, from Mali to the Middle East. And they have paid a heavy price for that involvement, as events in Paris, Nice, London and Manchester have made abundantly clear. But the assessment of the declaration as being purely symbolic may prove to be wrong in the long term – if a larger-scale Islamic State attack in the U.S. leads to Trump demanding that NATO provide a full-scale combat force to fight in Iraq or even Syria.\nWhat wasn’t said\nThree major issues were, however, ignored in Brussels.\nThe first was Russia. Trump’s ambiguous views about Russia contrast with the universal concern of Europeans. But NATO’s coming together around a common condemnation of Russian aggression in Ukraine allowed them all to smooth over their differences.\nSecond, disturbingly, Trump publicly declined to endorse the key security guarantee that is the foundation of NATO: a commitment that the U.S. would defend any NATO member attacked. In practice that means an attack by Russia.\nAnd finally, little was made of the leaking of critical intelligence about the terrorist attack in Manchester by American sources. Information sharing is at the heart of the fight against terrorism. But British Prime Minister Theresa May’s very vocal complaints were not addressed in Trump’s statement, although he did separately respond by authorizing an investigation into who and how it happened. Still, you can’t coordinate a fight against terrorism if your own services are leaking like a sieve.\nThe aftermath of Trump’s visit\nIn stark contrast to recent meetings with Obama, European leaders therefore were left unhappy by Trump’s lack of commitment to the core ideals that have traditionally bound NATO together: an explicit distrust of Russia’s intent and an explicit commitment to the values of democracy, human rights, free trade and free speech.\nThe fact that he ignored them all highlights the fact that the President Trump we see abroad is very similar to the President Trump we see at home."},{"url":"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/nashville-mayor-borrow-money-affordable-housing","title":"Nashville Mayor Wants to Borrow $25M for Affordable Housing","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"New data show need for 31,000 units.","date":"","full_text":"By a number of labor and economic measures, Nashville is the place to be.\n“In 2012, the city ranked first in the nation among large metro regions for fastest job growth, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,” Margaret Littman reported for Next City in 2014. “Nashville has added jobs faster than the nation in every year since 1990. Perhaps most tellingly, the city’s gross metropolitan product — the regional GDP — grew by 4.2 percent in 2013, double the national average; the city ranked third in economic growth after booming Austin and San Jose.”\nThat popularity, of course, brings a number of challenges, particularly in the area of housing. This week, Nashville Mayor Megan Barry’s office released a detailed report on the state of affordability in the city:\nNearly one out of four Nashville homeowners is cost-burdened, meaning they are paying more than 30 percent of their income on housing. Almost half of our renters are cost-burdened, including more than 70 percent of low-income renters.\nNashville needs roughly 31,000 affordable rental units by 2025, according to The Tennessean. One solution being proposed by the mayor is a first for the city. The newspaper reports she has “unveiled plans to issue $25 million in general obligation bonds to purchase and rehabilitate existing multifamily rental units as a way to preserve affordable units. Dollars also will go toward building affordable housing units on Metro-owned properties.”\nBarry has made affordable housing a priority. Next City has covered several other initiatives proposed to help with Nashville’s crunch. In 2015, a working group was created to encourage “affordable growth.” The following year, the Metro Council approved two proposals aimed at boosting the supply of affordable housing in Davidson County:\nThe first — and less controversial — piece of legislation outlines a new three-year pilot program that lets residential developers who agree to build affordably priced units compete for $2 million in grants. The trial program is optional for developers, and after its three years are up the council and mayor’s office will review the effectiveness of the program and decide whether or not to continue it.\nThe second bill centers around inclusionary zoning, and requires apartment developers in Nashville who are building five or more units to include a percentage of new affordable housing units in their projects when they request a zoning variance for the likes of density or height. The grants pilot program could help offset developers’ costs associated with making housing cheaper than market value.\nIn 2013, the city opened its first subsidized housing specifically for artists, Ryman Lofts. But as Littman noted in a Next City feature the following year: “The lofts rented quickly and now have a long wait-list.”\nTo read the full report released by Barry’s office, click here.\nRachel Dovey is an award-winning freelance writer and former USC Annenberg fellow living at the northern tip of California’s Bay Area.

Just ask the state of Georgia, which used data to discover that detention wasn't working for its young people. More than half who went to a juvenile-detention center in the state offended again, and either found themselves back in juvy or in prison if they had turned 18 years old.\nIn short, juvenile detention was not only pricey in Georgia—close to $90,000 per child per year—but the data show it didn't work to deter youth from continuing to commit crimes. While advocates knew this, it took lawmakers a while to take notice, but once they did, they overhauled the state's juvenile-justice laws, leading to fewer kids behind bars and instead getting needed therapy or counseling, as well as cost savings for the state.\nJuvenile detention in Mississippi is also much more costly than alternatives, and counties that have figured this out, like Adams, invest in other programs to save money. The majority of counties in this state, however, do not have alternatives or their own detention centers, so they waste a lot of their dollars transporting kids to and from the detention center they contract with, as well as paying that county to take care of them. If counties around the state looked at investing in alternatives to detention, they would save money in the long run.\nBut like Georgia, saving money takes investment—and reinvestment—at the front of reform movements. Georgia's General Assembly allocated additional money to implement reforms in 2013 as well as reinvested the money they would save from one of their reforms: not locking up kids for status offenses like being truant or running away. The investment and reinvestment of state dollars ultimately mean less kids in Georgia are locked up, and those kids who need counseling or therapy—not detention—have the opportunity to get it.\nGeorgia is a success story due to data collection. They had the information right in front of them, and while that data did not look good, it provided a road map and a way to make conditions better for kids across the state.\nData and dollar signs are the keys to reform, and we're missing both in Mississippi. Juvenile-detention facilities in the state are run by counties, not the State, which means that data are sparse and in some cases not there (see any Division of Youth Services annual report). With the kids locked up in each county's care, the state relinquishes responsibility for its own children.\nThe licensing act passed last legislative session was a necessary first step, but if that is all the state is willing to do to keep kids from entering the justice system, it is simply not enough. We cannot afford to lose another generation of Mississippians, primarily African Americans referred to youth courts around the state, to the incarceration system. Reform is going to take time, more money and data.\nThe tools are there; the exemplary models are there. Look to Georgia; look to Seattle, Wash.; look around. Even if comprehensive reform is years down the road, collecting data is vital to making the right policy choices.

LOUIS—Deep down a sunlit shaft, 175 feet under the North Riverfront neighborhood on the city’s far edge, Shayne Peck’s crew is beginning to hack a giant tunnel out of the limestone. Three men hang in the air on lifts, cutting into the rock face at spots marked with red paint. “They’re drilling holes,” says Peck, whose son is one of the drillers, “so we can load ’em with explosives.”\nThe start of the tunnel, just above the crew and the red-painted limestone, looks like the entrance to a cave in a cliff wall. Future blasts, Peck says, will deepen the tunnel—only 50 feet long now— until it stretches more than half a mile. This is not a tunnel for commuter trains or cars. It’s more of a horizontal well, and when it is complete in 2020, it will capture up to 12 million gallons of sewage-contaminated storm water, keeping it out of the Mississippi River. In effect, it will be a giant septic tank. But it won’t even be the biggest one in St. Louis.\nThe massive tunnel Peck has just started will soon be dwarfed by its successors. St. Louis is building a gargantuan system, including 28 miles of storage tunnels, to handle the city’s most stomach-churning water pollution problem. About 50 times a year, after major rainstorms, St. Louis’ sewers overflow, and 13 billion gallons of sewage-contaminated storm water escapes into the Mississippi River and its tributaries. It’s an everyday environmental nightmare and a risk to human health. And it’s a common, if largely undiscussed, urban American affliction.\nAll across the Northeast and Midwest, and in some regions beyond, more than 700 older cities still dump toilet waste into their oceans, lakes and rivers. The nasty problem is built into the cities’ infrastructure, a relic of early 20th-century engineering practices that were considered engineering triumphs in their day. The sewer systems, built decades ago, combine storm water and wastewater in the same pipes. On normal days, those millions of gallons of waste pass through a treatment plant. But after storms, the sewers become overwhelmed and the treatment plants can’t keep up. Instead of allowing the excess water to back up into streets and basements, the solution from decades past was to build overflow valves that divert some of the untreated flow into the nearest waterway. According to an Environmental Protection Agency report, just at the nation’s major beaches—a small portion of the country’s swimming areas—about 3,500 to 5,000 Americans a year get sick because of sewage-contaminated water.\nThat’s not OK anymore. Under pressure from the federal government, cities have embarked on decades-long projects to cut down on the sewage they spew. Since the 1990s, the EPA has used the Clean Water Act to take legal action against about 200 large and medium-sized cities. For big cities, the cost of compliance runs into the billions of dollars.\nSt. Louis’ agreement with the EPA, signed in 2012, is the most expensive in the continental U.S. It commits the region to spending $4.7 billion in engineering projects over 23 years to cut down on sewer overflow. As toxic as its effects are on water quality, the cure can be brutal for taxpayers, many of whom might never have been aware of the problem until they learned that their sewer fees would triple or more to pay for the solution. The regional program in St. Louis, called Project Clear, will cost about $3,600 across those 23 years for every man, woman and child in the city and its suburbs.\n“Over 20 million people get their drinking water from the Mississippi River, including the city of St. Louis,” says Francis Slay, whose 16-year tenure as St. Louis mayor ended April 18. “So it’s of absolute importance to make sure we have clean water.”\nSlay, while aware of the environmental consequences of doing nothing, nevertheless had an obligation to his constituents to soften the impact to their pocketbooks. After the EPA and a local environmental group sued St. Louis’ Metropolitan Sewer District in 2007, Slay, a Democrat, joined the negotiations and argued for a less costly project. “We were fighting for the taxpayers,” he says. “I was looking at cost, rates, timing, trying to do all we can to make it as reasonable as possible. And of course the EPA wanted to do it quicker, and they wanted it to be more expensive to start with—the same thing that was going on in cities across America.”\nThis cost containment encouraged the city to get creative. Instead of even more tunnels, St. Louis and the EPA agreed to substitute innovative ways of controlling storm water. Project Clear includes $100 million of green infrastructure projects, which give nature and open space the job of soaking up rain before it ever gets to the gutters. The sewer agency is building rain gardens on vacant lots and paying businesses to add water-thirsty minigardens to their developments. Many of the Metropolitan Sewer District’s green projects do more than lighten the burden on the sewers—they also have side effects that help St. Louis’ neighborhoods.\n“We can’t just spend the money we’re spending, and solve our problem, and have most of the solutions be underground,” says Brian Hoelscher, the sewer agency’s CEO. “We’re finding every opportunity we can to team with somebody…In a lot of cases, it makes the cost of our program less.”\nThe MSD is a regional agency that works closely with the city of St. Louis, whose mayor appoints half its board. That cooperation grew even closer on March 23, when the sewer agency began a $13.5 million effort to tear down condemned homes inside St. Louis and replace them with open space. The project will double the number of vacant, blighted homes torn down in St. Louis from 200 a year to 400—a huge help to a city that has lost more than half its population since its peak of 857,000 in 1950. For the neighborhood, each tear-down means one less dangerous eyesore. For the sewer system, each newly empty lot means about 10,000 fewer gallons of storm water coming in per year, which means less tainted overflow spilling out.\nBut by far the biggest component of the project is the tunnel system, which keeps 30 men occupied more or less full time, and will do so for many years to come. Shayne Peck, 47, a fourth-generation tunneler whose family built coal mines, used to excavate for the Chicago sewers. “I’m open to staying here in St. Louis,” Peck says. “I only need eight more years until I’m retired.”\nImage\n***\nA quiet waterway meanders through St. Louis’ vast Forest Park, threading past a classical-columned bandstand, under white-railed bridges, past bike paths and through verdant marshes. It might look bucolic but it’s man-made, constructed less than 20 years ago to imitate a real river that disappeared from the park more than a century ago. Near the waterway, in the park’s northeast corner, behind an overlooked gate set in the earth, concrete steps lead underground to reveal what happened to that lost river. Down below, a pair of century-old concrete tunnels, dark and ominous, rise 29 feet high to vaulted ceilings. The sound of flowing water echoes off the walls.\n“You’re standing inside a combined sewer,” says Lance LeComb, spokesman for the MSD. “It just happens to be a very large one.”\nIn one tunnel, brown water flows slowly, carrying a bit of debris now and then. A short weir divides the tunnel from its slightly higher twin, which holds a little trail of standing water. The flowing water, LeComb says, is wastewater coming from the western suburb of University City, four miles away. Across the channel, he points out the opening of a smaller tunnel in the far wall, where storm water from St. Louis’ Union Boulevard empties into the sewer.\nThis massive tunnel structure is what’s left of the River des Peres here in Forest Park. More than a century ago, the river bent here, turning from east to south on its route to the Mississippi River. But St. Louis, like many older cities, used its rivers and creeks as sewers in the 19th century. In 1904, when St. Louis held the World’s Fair in Forest Park, this stretch of the River des Peres stank so badly that the city enclosed it in a long wooden box. In the 1910s and 1920s, St. Louis banished the foul waterway permanently. The city dug an open-cut trench four miles long, built the twin tunnels inside, then buried them.\nThe tunnels are an engineering marvel, even now. They were declared a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1988. But even this mammoth structure, St. Louis’ largest combined sewer, can’t handle a heavy rain without overflowing. About a mile south, where the twin tunnels open into daylight, the water they carry falls through two large grates and into other sewers that run straight to the Lemay Wastewater Treatment Plant, the region’s second-largest sewage facility, which can treat up to 340 million gallons of water a day. But after storms, the grates become overwhelmed and the excess storm water and waste water spill into the last 10 miles of the River des Peres. Dozens more overflowing sewers do the same, feeding into the river before it opens into the Mississippi 10 miles south of the iconic Gateway Arch.\n“It’s not much of a river anymore,” says LeComb. “It’s what happens to urban rivers in America.”\nCities in 32 states have combined sewers. They’re mostly in the Northeast and the Midwest, where sewers often date from the mid-20th century or earlier. (Cities in the interior West and Southwest, which developed later, tended to build sewers that separate sewage from storm water.) But in those older cities, diluted sewage still overflows into rivers, lakes and oceans after rain. The consequences for public health are serious. Bacteria common in sewage, including salmonella and E. coli, can cause stomach and intestinal illness. Viruses can also lead to fever, skin infections and respiratory illness. Fishermen who eat their catch from polluted rivers are also at risk. Just how much risk depends on the body of water being polluted—how big it is, how fast it moves and how people interact with it. In many Great Lakes cities, signs go up on urban beaches after heavy summer storms, warning visitors that bacteria levels are too high for them to swim. One Cleveland beach had an advisory posted for half of all summer days in 2015.\nSince 1994, the EPA has worked its way across the country, roughly from east to west, suing cities’ sewer departments and agencies to force them to clean up. The result has been negotiated settlements (consent decrees overseen by federal judges) with cities such as Atlanta ($1.1 billion in 1998), Washington ($2.6 billion in 2003), Cincinnati ($3.3 billion in 2004), and Cleveland ($3 billion in 2011).\nThe enormous projects promised in consent decrees have meant big contracts for construction firms—and, sometimes, a chance for the unscrupulous to profiteer. A 1993 consent decree to improve the sewers of Birmingham, Alabama, played a role in a spectacular corruption scandal. It led to multiple bribery convictions of public officials and contractors—and Jefferson County’s 2011 municipal bankruptcy.\nIn 2015, the EPA declared that it, or state agencies, had addressed overflows in 201 of the nation’s 213 largest combined sewer systems. Only a few big cities have escaped lawsuits, most of them because they confronted their sewer overflows early. Milwaukee started to build tunnels to capture overflows in the 1970s. Philadelphia, which cooperates closely with the EPA, came to a less formal agreement instead of being sued. (New York City has a legal agreement with its state government, not the feds, to curb overflows.)\nHomeowners bear the costs of the anti-pollution projects, usually in spiking sewer bills. The EPA considers sewer rates a high burden if they’re more than 2 percent of a region’s median household income—but even then, it wants communities to finish their clean-water projects in 15 to 20 years. So local officials often come to consent decree negotiations seeking to limit how much they’ll have to spend to control overflows and how many years they’ll have to finish.\nThose stakes were especially high for the St. Louis region. It has the nation’s fourth-largest sewer system, behind only New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. The city of St. Louis also has a high poverty rate, so sewer bills can take up a big portion of poorer city homeowners’ budgets.\nGoing into consent-decree negotiations, the sewer agency braced itself for a $6 billion bill and 15 to 17 years to get the work done. That would’ve sent sewer rates soaring, from a low $14 a month for the average single-family house in 2003, and $28 a month in 2011, past $100 a month in the 2020s.\n“If they had just charged us more money and wanted to get it done quicker, it would have been devastating,” says Slay, the former mayor. “We have a high level of poverty in the city of St. Louis. What we’re doing now is going to be a heavy burden on households.”\nInstead, the 2012 consent decree settled on $4.7 billion over 23 years. That included $1.8 billion to reduce combined sewer overflows in the city and some nearby suburbs, mostly by building those 28 miles of storage tunnels. It also includes $2 billion to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows in the outer suburbs—a different challenge that involves keeping storm water out of the separate wastewater system, testing sewer lines for clogs and cleaning them out, building above-ground storage tanks, and disconnecting suburban homes’ downspouts from the sewer system.\nThe St. Louis consent decree is still the second largest the EPA has negotiated in a sewer case, second only to Honolulu’s $5 billion. St. Louis saved a lot of money by persuading the EPA to let it deal with overflows in half of the city without building interceptor tunnels—by building green infrastructure instead of gray.\nThe old bungalow’s front-porch roof was splintered and sagging. Its roof tiles were tattered, a gutter was gone and a missing side door or window was replaced by only a thin board. It was just one of thousands of vacant buildings in St. Louis—but on March 23, the mayor, the local alderman, and the head of St. Louis’ sewer agency came out to see an excavator’s claw tear it down.\nWith that demolition, the sewer agency became a partner in the city’s drive to knock down its most ruined houses. St. Louis has lost more than half its population since the mid-20th century, settling at 318,000 today. When people leave, they leave houses behind. Parts of north St. Louis are peppered with empty houses in various states of decay. “Doll houses,” some St. Louisans call them because a missing wall, ripped away by scavengers, lets you look straight inside.\nMSD’s $13.5 million home demolition program will knock down about 200 more houses a year (up from 200) and leave the lots vacant to absorb rainwater. A pilot program showed that the newly vacant lots reduced the load on the sewer system by soaking up more rain. Every acre of impervious surface removed translated into 231,000 gallons less sewer overflow.\nAlderman Jeffrey Boyd, whose north St. Louis ward includes some of the city’s most vacant lots, calls it a win-win for the sewer agency and his constituents. “One of the biggest concerns people have in the neighborhood are the vacant buildings,” says Boyd, “that either they’ll fall on someone, or some kid’s going to get snatched up into one.”\nSt. Louis’ consent agreement with the EPA includes $100 million in green infrastructure projects—changes to the land that keep rain out of the sewer system. It’s one of the largest such commitments in the country. And it’ll transform empty land across St. Louis’ north side.\nLike the rain garden on a vacant lot in St. Louis’ Old North neighborhood. Created by MSD, the garden is specially landscaped and engineered to absorb storm water from nearby streets. Even in late March, before it blooms fully, the lot is a subtle landscape of green, red and orange plants. Purple coneflower, sumac and sedges, all native to Missouri, were chosen to appeal to birds and butterflies and to soak up a lot of rain. The land is sculpted into a basin, lower than street level. In the streets around the garden, cuts in the curbs look like gutters—but they flow into the garden instead of underground.\nThough the two-century-old Old North neighborhood has suffered from abandonment, it has begun to experience prosperity, too. The Crown Square project, completed in 2010, rehabilitated 27 historic buildings a few blocks down North 14th Street. Development is springing up even closer to the rain garden: new houses in a row two blocks away, some homes with stickers still on their new windows the other direction. Future developers of nearby blocks will benefit from the rain garden taking in some of their property’s storm runoff from their property. “If a new development goes in over there,” says MSD’s LeComb, “that new development won’t have to pay for the same level of storm water control, because it’s already being done by us.”\nWest of downtown St. Louis, developers have benefited directly from another MSD program, which compensates them if they build green infrastructure. The parking lot of the new Ikea on Forest Park Boulevard is ringed with green gardens full of rain-slurping plants. A new office park on several nearby blocks has little gardens and tree lawns next to the street, soaking in rain from the street.\nImage\nAcross the country, forward-thinking sewer agencies are building green infrastructure and calculating where it’ll do the most good, both for the sewer system and the community. Kansas City, Missouri, which signed a $2.4 billion consent decree in 2010, aims to create $68 million in green infrastructure, much of it in the city’s Marlborough neighborhood, where a nine-acre park with a wetland pond is under construction. DC Water in Washington plans to install permeable pavement in six locations in the District this summer and fall. In the Brightwood neighborhood, it’s already spent $2 million on street trees and little curbside pockets of green space to collect rain water.\nBack in St. Louis, the green infrastructure program isn’t the only part of Project Clear that’s changing the city’s landscape. MSD is also spending $230 million on its Cityshed program, which has tackled flooding that burdens the sewer system. In eight low-lying areas, including valleys where creeks once ran, MSD offered to buy the homes of a couple of hundred homeowners whose basements chronically flood. All but a few of them have taken the sewer agency’s offers and moved. LeComb says the agency followed federal guidelines on fair financial offers to relocate homeowners, paying moving expenses and the cost of buying a comparable home elsewhere.\nMSD’s clean-water plans split St. Louis in half. The north and east get green infrastructure, while the south and west get old-fashioned gray infrastructure—tunnels and other projects made of concrete and steel. There are two reasons for the split. Sewers in the north and east flow, and overflow, directly to the Mississippi River. Sewers in the south and west head to the River des Peres. Coincidentally, that water divide roughly lines up with St. Louis’ economic and social divides. The north side, home to the city’s predominantly African-American neighborhoods, has suffered for decades from white flight and disinvestment. Today, it’s struggling the most with vacant and abandoned properties. That’s left more room for green space, and more demand for demolition projects.\nBoyd, the alderman, says he’s not aware of any opposition to Project Clear’s different approaches for the two sides of town. MSD’s green goals for the north side fit his constituents’ wishes. They responded to the March 23 demolition with enthusiasm. “After a story aired, I got calls: ‘Would you consider [knocking down] a building on my street?’”\nBut there are limits to what green infrastructure can do for a city and its sewers. The EPA allowed St. Louis to go all-green to the north because less stringent water-quality standards apply to the Mississippi River. On the south side of town, where sewers overflow into the River des Peres, storage tunnels and other gray infrastructure will slash the overflow volume, currently 6.3 billion gallons a year, by roughly 80 percent. On the north side, the $100 million in green infrastructure will reduce the volume of the sewage-tainted overflows going directly into the Mississippi by 110 million gallons a year—less than 2 percent of the 7 billion gallons that overflow there every year. Since the River des Peres flows into the Mississippi, that means Project Clear will reduce the total overflows into the Mississippi by about 40 percent.\nIs it OK to let so much sewage into the Mississippi River? It seems like a shoddy way to treat America’s most legendary waterway, which carried Mark Twain and Huckleberry Finn to exploration and adventure. But the ways Americans have used and altered the Mississippi actually explain the different treatment.\nNear St. Louis “we have a very fast-flowing, managed river that’s really constructed for commerce,” says Hoelscher, the sewer agency’s CEO. “We don’t have beaches.” In short, it’s a river that doesn’t need a lot of coddling.\nThe EPA has several levels of water-quality standards, depending in part on how people use a lake or river. It’s a quarter-mile wide at St. Louis, with a strong current. No one dips into it for a swim—it’s too dangerous. In fact, though St. Louis celebrates its identity as a riverfront city, there aren’t many places where people can visit the river. Industrial uses line its banks north of downtown. Even near the Gateway Arch and in Laclede’s Landing, the historic waterfront neighborhood, tall concrete levees guard against floods. The EPA doesn’t consider the Mississippi a waterway for swimming, though it does require enough pollution controls to protect \"secondary\" recreation, such as boating and fishing. That contributes to its tolerance for continued sewer overflows along its banks. The giant waterway can absorb, dilute, churn and metabolize more pollution than a trickling stream in a drainage channel—such as the River des Peres.\nSo, despite all the ways green infrastructure can improve and beautify a city, sewer agencies can’t go all-green, because concrete tunnels usually provide more bang for the buck. Which brings us back to the titanic engineering project now underway.\nEven where the River des Peres still exists, it’s an unnatural waterway, altered by human design. In the near-west suburbs, just before its plunges into the Forest Park tubes and becomes a sewer line, the river is often bound by concrete. When it re-emerges above ground after the park, it’s a wide, V-shaped drainage canal. A Works Progress Administration project built during the New Deal, the channel replaced the old, natural riverbed. Most days, the broad channel has only a trickle of water in it—a mix of standing rainwater and the remnants of the last storm’s sewer overflows. The only time it really looks like a river is after heavy storms, when water can back up the tributary from the surging Mississippi River. As unsightly as the river is, people come into contact with the River des Peres often. No one swims in it, but a bike path runs along a stretch of it. Houses back up to it. “It’s just an empty big huge ditch,” says Hoelscher, “that birds, ducks and kids like to play in.”\nIt’s not as bad as it was in the 1980s, when residents often called it the River de Pew because of its stench. In the 1990s and 2000s, even before the EPA came calling, MSD spent $2.3 billion to cut its number of sewer overflow points regionwide from about 700 to about 400. But the River des Peres channel is still a health hazard. A kid playing, or an adult picking up trash, could be exposed to E. coli and other bacteria common in human waste.\nSo this is where MSD will build most of its tunnels. In 2020, it’ll start Project Clear’s biggest single project, the nine-mile-long, 30-foot-wide, $630 million Lower \u0026 Middle River des Peres Storage Tunnel. The behemoth will run under the River des Peres from the Forest Park tubes’ outflow to near the Lemay treatment plant on the Mississippi. It’ll capture up to 206 million gallons of combined sewer overflow after storms. In 2024, MSD plans to start a two-mile tunnel under some River des Peres tributaries. In 2028, it’s agreed to start another 9,000-foot tunnel to capture overflows that now go into the Upper River des Peres in University City. For those projects, tunnel-boring machines, rather than explosives, will handle most of the work.\nOnce it’s all done, Project Clear is supposed cut the number of overflows a year into the River des Peres from about 50 to about four. The total volume of overflows should fall 80 percent, to about 1.2 billion gallons a year. It’s not perfect, but no city’s combined-sewer project is. The rule of thumb in overflow control and tunnel-building is that the costs escalate fast the farther you push toward zero and try to contain the flow from the very heaviest storms.\nAnd, unfortunately, the price will keep spiking for St. Louis homeowners. Average sewer rates will hit $44 per month this year, $61 a month in 2020, and possibly as much as $90 a month in the mid-2020s. “We’re trying to find how to lower the next set of rates,” says Hoelscher. Smart financing helps some. In 2016, area voters approved the sale of bonds to fund Project Clear. MSD is also the biggest user of the state of Missouri’s revolving loan fund.\nThe consent decree will set MSD’s priorities until 2035. The proposed cuts to the EPA in the Trump administration’s proposed fiscal year 2018 budget will affect St. Louis only indirectly, if at all. The proposal includes a 37 percent cut to the EPA’s civil enforcement division, which takes local governments and businesses to court, and a 12 percent cut in compliance monitoring. “It’s going to cripple the ability of EPA to move forward with more enforcement on CSOs,” warns Amanda Waters, general counsel of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies. Cuts like that could slow the EPA’s efforts to get the last few major holdout cities under combined-sewer consent decrees.\nOnce a consent decree is signed, it’s hard to change—as the Trump administration is discovering in the realm of police reform. A federal judge recently approved Baltimore’s police consent decree, negotiated by the Obama administration, despite the Trump administration’s attempt to delay it. Likewise, even an EPA less friendly to regulation can’t change existing clean-water decrees easily. “A judge has the responsibility to oversee that decree for the life of it,” Waters says. “You’d have to go back to the judge, and explain why [changing it is the] right thing.”\nBut a weaker EPA could make it harder to cities like St. Louis to renegotiate their decrees to fit changing technologies—for example, to substitute more green infrastructure for gray. “This is the part that concerns me the most about these cuts,” says Waters, “for our existing members who need to be able to adapt their decrees to match the times.”"},{"url":"https://www.devex.com/news/to-save-the-world-s-forests-protect-women-s-land-rights-89971","title":null,"author_text":null,"keywords":null,"publication_text":null,"description":null,"date":"","full_text":"National laws and regulations in low- and middle-income countries consistently fail to protect the land rights of women living in indigenous and rural communities, making them ill-prepared to reach the targets set by the Sustainable Development Goals or the Paris Agreement on climate change, a new report called “Power and Potential” released by the Rights and Resources Initiative, or RRI, reveals.\nWomen’s ability to access forests and to take part in decision-making regarding resource utilization is crucial to conservation and climate change mitigation efforts, the report notes. It also contributes to economic development at the community and national levels. But even in cases where community-level practices provide women with access to, and control over land, weak regulations on tenure rights increase their vulnerability to social, economic and environmental shocks.\nThe RRI report looks at 30 low- and middle-income countries and examines 80 sets of laws and regulations framing the ownership or management of natural resources at the community-level, otherwise known as community-based tenure regimes. It does so by looking at three legal indicators at the national level, deemed essential for the protection of women’s forest tenure rights: Constitutional equal protection, affirmation of women’s property rights and inheritance. It also analyses five CBTR-specific indicators: Membership, inheritance in CBTR-specific laws, voting, leadership and dispute resolution. For more information, click here.\n“International laws have done a good job in addressing the need and importance of securing these tenure rights,” said Solange Bandiaky-Badji, RRI’s head of gender justice and Africa programs. “Most of the governments have ratified those international laws, but what is really missing are the national laws, safeguards and protection mechanisms that make sure that those laws are translated into practice.”\nThe results show that laws and regulations in these countries — otherwise called “statutory laws” — fail to meet the standards set by international agreements such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, known as CEDAW. They also constitute a barrier to reaching the targets set by the Paris Agreement on climate change, and by the SDGs in terms of gender equality, livelihoods, conservation efforts and economic development. While substantial variations exist between countries and regions, no country stands out as a champion of women’s tenure rights.\nLinking land rights to women’s rights\nInsecure tenure rights have been shown to limit women’s choices concerning marriage and non-marital unions, leading to higher incidences of domestic violence, increased rates of HIV infections and diminished capacity to deal with the consequences of AIDS. By contrast, safe and secure land rights generate positive socio-economic outcomes for women, their families and the communities in which they reside.\nFor more information on the initiatives supporting land and resource rights, join the RRI for the third international conference on community land and resource rights, “Reducing inequality in a turbulent world: Scaling-up strategies to secure indigenous, community, and women's land rights” in Stockholm, Sweden, on Oct. 4-5. Over two days, key stakeholders will discuss how governments, the private sector, and the international community can come together to tackle the inequality and the marginalization of women, indigenous peoples, and rural communities.\n“The role of land rights is very much linked to the respect of indigenous women's rights, as well as enhancing their possibilities to make decisions related to how development should take place in their own communities,” said Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples to the United Nations, in an interview with Devex during the 16th session of the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, where she spoke about engaging women in climate action.\nWomen play a crucial role in their communities by gathering and producing food and resources, preserving traditional crops, and resisting abusive exploitation or expropriation of their lands, she added.\n“Usually the women are the ones who resist, and I have seen this in many communities,” said Tauli-Corpuz.\nMaking the economic case to strengthen women’s forest tenure rights\nGuaranteeing access to land is not enough to provide women with full tenure rights. According to the report, insufficient inheritance laws at the national level, for example, can affect women’s right to the land after the death of their husband. Less than one third of the countries examined by the legal scan mandate that all daughters, widows and unmarried women in consensual unions have equal rights to inherit alongside their male counterparts, which limits the transfer of land ownership to women and their children.\nOther legal factors such as the ability to own land, membership rights in the community and participation in local governance through voting or other forms of decision-making all play an important role in upholding the rights of indigenous and rural women.\nRRI’s Bandiaky-Badji said that governments have an economic incentive to protect women’s tenure rights.\n“Women’s land rights and women's rights to forests contributes to economic development,” she said, explaining that women’s rights should be seen as an enabler of economic growth.\nIn Burkina Faso, for example, women are deeply involved in the collection, processing and trading of non-timber forest products sold internationally. Their activity across the value chain benefits both the local and national economies.\n“What we're seeing in many countries is that the women who own land and are able to make good use of that land are using that money to pay for school fees, for example,” said Bandiaky-Badji. “That kind of contribution is key, because that's what ensures that children are educated and can change the pattern of poverty.”\nTenure insecurity has been shown to be the main driver of poverty in forests and rural areas; migration patterns see more men leaving their communities to work in cities or for local resource extraction companies, leaving women with a greater responsibility to provide for their families.\n“In order for us to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we need to start by recognizing the rights of those who are actually managing those resources, and who have been managing those resources for decades.”\nWomen as agents in the fight against climate change\nLand tenure is also inextricably linked to environmental issues, as women are known to play a key role in protecting natural resources in their communities. By having greater control and ownership of the land, women have an incentive to protect local resources, Bandiaky-Badji said. Women are also disproportionately affected by climate change, natural disasters and large land acquisition, the report notes, which in turns impact the whole community.\nPenny Davies, a program officer working on climate change and land use at the Ford Foundation, said the RRI report reinforces the idea that women play a key role in climate change mitigation.\n“The only functioning, viable to scale, carbon-capture storage technology that exists are forests, via photosynthesis,” she said. “A third of the world’s tropical forests are managed by indigenous and local communities, and the backbone of that is the hands of women.”\nDavies added that governments and development organizations should regard women living in indigenous and rural communities as essential partners in the fight against climate change.\n“Forest women are a climate solution, and they need these community-based tenure regimes to ensure that that solution is not eroded by vested interests,” she said.\nThe report makes a number of recommendations for donors and development\norganizations, including supporting the reform of national laws and regulations, as well as the recognition of equal forest rights of indigenous and rural women. It calls for development actors to adopt a gender lens when addressing issues affecting women’s tenure rights — such as indigenous rights, education, climate change mitigation and conservation efforts, and to increase collaboration and information-sharing among organizations working in these different sectors.\nFor RRI’s Bandiaky-Badji, the report fills a critical gap in the existing research around indigenous and rural women’s rights.\n“The collective tenure rights of women have been missing from the feminist literature around women and the environment, and women and natural resource management,” she said, adding that the existing research tends to look at women’s access to land from an individual perspective.\n“In order for us to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we need to start by recognizing the rights of those who are actually managing those resources, and who have been managing those resources for decades,” she said.\nDevelopment organizations and corporations looking at implementing social programs in the communities in which they operate should make use of gender-disaggregated data to determine the specific needs of women, Bandiaky-Badji said. Above all, they should make sure that women are consulted and given a voice, and that conservation efforts benefit those who are on the frontlines of the fight against climate change.\nEditorial Associate Helen Morgan contributed reporting.\nHow can the international community come together to tackle the inequality and the marginalization of women, indigenous peoples, and rural communities?

The Recovery District eventually converted all of those schools into public charter schools. This decision not only fundamentally altered how the city’s schools are run but also upended a profession that launched thousands of black New Orleanians into the middle class. A new study from the Education Research Alliance at Tulane University shows that half of the teachers fired never worked in Louisiana public schools again.\nPre-Katrina New Orleans schools were a bit of an anomaly. In 2003, just 15 percent of teachers in large urban districts across the country were black but in New Orleans, teaching was largely a job done by black women: 71 percent of teachers were black and 78 percent were women. The demographics of the city’s teacher workforce have changed drastically since: in 2014, black teachers comprised a little less than half of the city’s teacher corps.\nIn the years following Katrina, New Orleans became a mecca for new teachers. Before Katrina, the city’s teachers had an average of 15 years of classroom experience. Now the majority of teachers have less than five years of experience. Jane Arnold Lincove, a professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and the study’s lead author, says that the study suggests that the prospects for those veteran teachers fired after Katrina only got worse over the years, as more schools went charter and those schools embraced younger teachers recruited through programs like Teach for America.\nOnly half of New Orleans’ 4,300 teachers were rehired in the years after Hurricane Katrina\nThe study highlights two years of employment records to show how pre-Katrina teachers fared as the reforms took hold. In 2007, the second full school year after Katrina, those teachers made up a large share of the city’s educators, but they subsequently started to leave the city’s schools in large numbers.\n“Some of that could be teachers retiring, but it could also be that even if they got hired they might not have been the kinds of teachers the charters wanted,” said Lincove. “Veteran teachers get paid more, they might have been cut to help schools meet their budgets. We don’t know if a teacher left a school voluntarily or because they were forced out, but what we do know is that when exiting teachers were replaced they were replaced with teachers who were paid less, had less experience, and were more likely to be white and from out of state.”\nIn the fall of 2007, about a third of the 4,300 teachers fired after Katrina were working in New Orleans public schools again. Another 18 percent were working elsewhere in the state. But by the fall of 2013, just 22 percent of those educators were still working in New Orleans. That’s a much larger drop than seen elsewhere in the state where 15 percent of the Katrina cohort was still employed by schools in other parishes. Some of the turnover can be explained by natural attrition. Nearly a third of the teachers fired in 2006 were already eligible for full retirement benefits. But when comparing pre-Katrina New Orleans teachers to similar educators in other parishes devastated by 2005 hurricanes, the researchers estimate that the attrition rate was at least 16 percentage points higher for the city’s teachers.\nWhile the black community was hit harder by the firings because so many teachers were African American, the researchers did not find a racial disparity in who was rehired after the storm. In fact they found that black teachers were slightly more likely to return to New Orleans schools than their white peers. But the researchers found that white teachers fired after Katrina were more likely to be hired by charter schools than black teachers were. Returning black teachers were more likely to be hired by the few schools still run by the Orleans Parish School Board. Lincove says it’s unclear if this trend emerged due to hiring practices at charter schools or because teaching in the city just became less attractive to black teachers. One important difference Lincove points out between OPSB schools and charters is that the district still offers teachers a pension.\n“A lot of people have been talking about the effects of these reforms on the black middle class,” said Lincove. “While we saw more rehiring than we expected, I think we need to look at the long term of effects of falling out of the pension system. Teachers now have to accept a job without a pension, so we are going to see a different type of teacher.”\nLincove added that charter leaders worried about teachers not viewing it as a long term career should “think systematically about what kinds of long term retirement benefits and long-term job security might need to be offered to avoid this.”\nBrian Beabout, a professor at the University of New Orleans, says that it’s going to take more than changing benefits to make New Orleans a town for career teachers again.\n“I think we want to fight this fight on two fronts,” said Beabout. “We want to make career teaching is a viable pathway. That’s good for our students, particularly for getting some consistency for students that have gone through a lot of trauma. But the pressure of accountability makes teaching a very different practice than it was, before.”\nThe use of standardized tests to evaluate schools and individual teachers has been harder for veterans to adapt to, Beabout argues. “ There’s a lot of pressure on teachers that wasn’t there before,” he said. “Charter leaders have to recognize they are not going to get 25 years from everyone, so the question is how do we get from four years to staying eight or 10 years.”\nThere is currently a concerted effort by several charter leaders to recruit teachers with local roots, particularly black educators, in large part because those teachers are more likely to stick around for the long haul. This local initiative is part of a larger national push that is responding to bevy of research showing that black kids benefit from having black teachers. Black students tend to be disciplined less, graduate at higher rates and get referred to advanced classes more when they have black teachers.\nThere are several limitations to the study. Researchers utilized Louisiana Department of Education employment records, so the study can only speak to whether or not fired teachers ever worked in a Louisiana public school again. Some of these teachers could now be working in private schools or in other states. The data also only runs through 2013, largely before the local hiring push, so it remains unclear of teachers fired after Katrina have benefited from that nascant emphasis.\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

The exposed eight-inch water line at the bottom used to feed water to a nearby house. But the line blew when the house was demolished. The resulting leak ate away at the pavement. Because none of the neighbors called to complain about low water pressure, PWSA didn’t know there was a leak until the pavement started to go wonky. It was a pretty standard fix, said Gigliotti: uncover the line, assess the problem, fix the problem, fill the hole.\n“We joke, every day’s different, but it’s the same. We’re not digging here tomorrow to make a repair, we’re digging somewhere else,” he said. “It’s endless. There’s always going to be room for repair.”\nIt’s true of any complicated system, but it’s particularly true in Pittsburgh.\nPittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto told a packed City Council chambers earlier this spring that the municipal water system faced significant risk.\n“[There are] over a half dozen areas where if they are to fail, where if one thing goes wrong, the entire city is without water,” he said.\nNot exactly what a roomful of water-drinking residents might like to hear. But Peduto said it’s time to take an honest look at the city’s water system, joking later, “Today’s rip-the-Band-Aid-off day.”\nAnd Pittsburgh isn’t alone. Thirty percent of the state’s water systems aren’t as resilient as they need to be, said Lisa Daniels, director of Pennsylvania’s Bureau of Safe Drinking Water.\n“That could mean they don’t have backup power supply. They may not have adequate finished water storage,\" said Daniels. \"They may not have interconnections that would allow them to purchase water from somebody else if something would go wrong in their system.”\nStrengthening systems so they can withstand breaks, failures, and emergencies means finding even more money.\n“They just now need to begin to think about how resiliency plays into that, and they have to put it on their priority list,” she said.\nThere hasn’t been a clear priority list in Pittsburgh for a long time, said Bob Weimar, PWSA’s interim director. Normally, something called a condition assessment is done every five years or so, to figure out how all the assets in a water system are holding up.\n“We’ve been lucky to get them every 10 or 20,” said Weimar.\nWhat’s more, there hasn’t been a capital improvement plan, setting out which assets need the most attention, and how soon; as well as how much money it will require.\nThe mayor’s concern is warranted, said Weimar.\n“The public should go away with the idea that, yes, we need to make investment[s] and it's not a short-term, immediate fix. It's going to be a long-term investment in the system,” he said.\nHistorically, the authority has failed to make that kind of investment, said Weimar.\n“We should be spending over $100 million a year in replacement or upgrade or reconditioning. And we're not.”\nAnd haven’t. In fact, Weimar said plans for Pittsburgh’s water system long ago called for backup pipes to protect against the kind of compounding failures happening today.\n“They were planned but never built,” he said. “So it's not that we didn't have the thought that it was needed but we didn't have the commitment to financing, to raising the rates necessary to meet the investments.”\nOver the last few decades, water systems across the state, and the country, have seen declining investment. For a long time, governments and authorities spent less money on water systems because they just worked, said Shannon Gority, CEO of Capital Region Water in Harrisburg.\n“I like to say that our industry did such a good job that we’ve put ourselves in this position. Because we were out of sight, out of mind,” she said. “Many political figures based their budgets on not wanting to raise rates, being proud of not having not raised water and sewer rates in a decade or more.”\nWhen budgets really get tight, Gority said preventive maintenance is the first thing to go out the door. That, coupled with aging infrastructure, creates a disconnect, said Gority: people want and expect clean water, but they’re not willing to pay for it.\n“I understand not everybody thinks about water every day. That’s our job at the water utilities. But we need our constituents to know just enough to...put the right value on these systems, so that we can get done what we need to get done,” she said.\nSome cities are farther along than others. The Philadelphia Water Department annually replaces more than 28 miles of water mains. The city’s water commissioner, Debra McCarty, hopes to see that number go up to 40 miles a year.\n“We have a longstanding history of reinvesting in our infrastructure,” said McCarty.\nPhilly is one of the largest water systems in the state, with the budgets to match. In fiscal year 2018, the department will invest more than $350 million in the water and sewer systems, as well as $750 million dollars on operations, which includes maintenance costs.\nFor cities that don’t have that track record of reinvestment, McCarty’s advice is to monitor and maintain, plan carefully, and spend judiciously.\n“Any money you spend, particularly if it’s not yours, it’s the ratepayers’. You spend it just in time. Just before it breaks,” she said.\nPreventive maintenance is the ideal, but it’s not always possible. In Pittsburgh, they’ve had to take a “fix as fail” approach, said Weimar. Not because they want to: it’s inconvenient, and expensive. But like many cities, Pittsburgh faces decades of backlog.\nA process is underway to restructure the city’s water and sewer authority so it can better manage its debt and make necessary investments."},{"url":"http://www.fayobserver.com/news/20170603/raise-age-law-would-affect-12000-teens-charged-with-crimes-each-year","title":"'Raise the Age' law would affect 12,000 teens charged with crimes each year","author_text":"Paul Woolverton","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Fayetteville Observer","description":"Unless North Carolina changes its laws, it soon will be the last state in the nation that automatically treats 16- and 17-year-old teenagers as adults when they are charged with a crime.\r\n“Raise the Age” legislation to move North Carolina into the national mainstream and set the age for facing adult charges for many crimes at 18 is moving through the General Assembly despite resistance from some quarters.

[Johnny Horne/The Fayetteville Observer]\nUnless North Carolina changes its laws, it soon will be the last state in the nation that automatically treats 16- and 17-year-old teenagers as adults when they are charged with a crime.\n“Raise the Age” legislation to move North Carolina into the national mainstream and set the age for facing adult charges for many crimes at 18 is moving through the General Assembly despite resistance from some quarters. The change could affect nearly 12,000 teenagers who get in trouble each year, according to an estimate by the legislature’s research staff.\nRaise the Age advocates say it’s unfair and harmful to society to saddle an teenager with a lifelong criminal record for mistakes made in a reckless period of youth. Because their brains are still developing, the advocates say, teens are less mature, less able to control their impulses and less able to make rational decisions.\nOpponents contend the change would be soft on crime and expensive to implement.\nAs of now, New York is the only other state that treats 16-year-olds as adults in criminal matters. But it is ending that practice. In April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law that will set the age at 18 on Oct. 1, 2019.\nThe bills working their way through North Carolina’s legislature would make the change the same year.\n[How does the N.C. criminal age of adulthood compare against other states? View our map]\nSubject of debate\nCumberland County’s chief District Court judge, Robert Stiehl, believes the change in the law is needed.\n“A part of growing up is making mistakes and hopefully learning from those mistakes,” Stiehl said.\nThe juvenile court system generally is better than the adult system at disciplining and counseling young people, Stiehl said. He called it better equipped to lower the chance teens will get in trouble with the law again.\n“It’s not a matter of letting people off. It’s a matter of changing cognitive behaviors,” he said.\nFurther, juvenile records are sealed from public view, Stiehl said, unlike adult records that are available to any person who asks to review them.\nEmployers, schools, landlords, the military and others commonly do criminal background checks to screen applicants. Some employers do background checks of existing employees and use the findings as a basis to dismiss them.\nState agencies that issue the licenses that North Carolina requires for many jobs consider a person’s criminal background, Stiehl said.\n“It becomes clear to me,” he said, “that these convictions do become impediments to scholarship money, employability, future employment.”\nOn Tuesday, several faith leaders held a press conference at the legislature and delivered letters saying that the Raise the Age law is a moral imperative.\n“Yes, youth can do some really stupid things in life. That’s why we don’t need to respond stupidly when they do,” wrote the Rev. Mark Creech of the Christian Action League.\nHe recalled counseling a girl that he described as “a wayward teen.”\n“The irony is that at your age you are not wise enough to make these decisions,” he said he told her, “and the tragedy of the situation is that by the time you’ve sufficiently matured it could be too late.”\nCritics of the legislation, such as state Republican Rep. Larry G. Pittman of Cabarrus County, say Raise the Age legislation would coddle people old enough to know better than to break the law.\n“I hear people say, ‘Oh, they just made a mistake,’” Pittman, a minister, said when the House debated the legislation on May 17. “Well ‘two plus two equals five’ is a mistake. ... Theft is a crime.”\nPittman said teens vandalized a home his stepfather was renovating and were treated leniently by the courts, and the house later burned down under mysterious circumstances. “This case is a good example of what’s wrong with this bill. We will be telling the victims of crime that it’s no big deal, just because the perpetrators are under 18,” Pittman said. “That’s ludicrous.”\nLegal contradiction\nUntil a Raise the Age bill passes, North Carolina law will continue to treat people age 16 and 17 simultaneously as adults when they commit crimes and as children when they are the victims of crime.\nIn some cases, this can happen to the same person for the same “crime.” In 2015, the results of the contradiction generated international headlines over a case in Cumberland County.\nThat’s when two 16-year-olds from Fayetteville were accused of manufacturing child pornography after they were caught with nude “selfie” photos that they made to share with each other.\nA warrant for the girl said she was an adult who made and possessed child pornography when she stood naked in front of a mirror and took a picture of herself. But it was only a crime because the girl, under 18, was considered a minor victim. Similarly, warrants accused the boy of being an adult pornographer who victimized his minor self when he made nude selfies.\nThe charges were felonies. If the teens had been convicted, they could have gone to prison for at least 15 months each and would have had to register as sex offenders for at least 10 years.\nThe charges against both teens were eventually dismissed. But the two still spent more than a year mired in the court system. They had to serve probation and do community service in order to get their cases dismissed.\nJudges also barred the teens from using cell phones while they were on probation.\nThe boy had been a quarterback on his high school football team and hoped to play in college. His father said he was rejected by college football teams and denied possible scholarships because of charges.\nAlso in 2015, a 16-year-old teen was trapped in legal limbo in the Cumberland County jail for more than two weeks because of her age.\nThe legal system said the teen was an adult who allegedly threatened to kick and slap someone, a misdemeanor. At the same time, in the eyes of the law, the teen was still a child and she therefore could not be released from the jail without a parent or guardian to sign her bail documents.\nThe teen’s guardian, the Wake County Department of Social Services, refused. The agency did not want to have pay $2,000 if she skipped her court date.\nThe teen wasn’t released until a judge intervened. By then, she had been jailed for 17 days.\nIf the teen had been 18, she would have been allowed to sign herself out of the jail after her second day there.\nCumberland County strategies\nBased on issues such as those described above, Cumberland County judicial and law enforcement officials decided it’s wrong to automatically impose adult criminal charges on all people age 16 and 17. In 2016, they created programs to sidestep state law.\nA sexting diversion program was set up to allow teens to avoid felony porn charges when they make and share nude photos of themselves. If caught, the teens must attend classes on the risks of sexting, such as becoming victims of extortion or revenge porn. The youth have to write essays and do community service.\nCumberland County’s Misdemeanor Diversion Program, implemented this past fall, allows some teens age 16 and 17 to avoid adult court when they are accused of misdemeanor crimes. It applies to teens who have no adult criminal record, and who aren’t charged with sex offenses, firearms offenses or traffic offenses.\nThe teens must do community service, take anger-management and problem-solving classes and meet other requirements in order to keep the crimes off their records.\nStatewide, 11 counties have misdemeanor diversion programs.\nThese would become obsolete should the Raise the Age legislation pass.\nThe Senate on May 12 approved a version that would apply only to misdemeanor crimes and would take effect Dec. 1, 2020. Five days later, in its bill that applies to misdemeanors and some felonies, the House voted for a start date of Oct. 1, 2019. For the Raise the Age legislation to become law, the Senate and House will have to agree on common language and each vote again on the new bill.\nIf the final legislation includes the House’s felony provisions, 16- and 17-year-olds will not be charged as adults for the four lowest levels under North Carolina’s multi-tier system of classifying those crimes. The state uses letter grades on a scale from A through I to classify the severity of a felony crime. First-degree murder is an A-level felony.\nExamples of I-level felonies include such things as breaking into vending machines and some types of vandalism.\nThe House version of Raise the Age would keep A through E level felonies in adult court and put F through I felonies in juvenile court.\nThat line of demarcation would only partly help sexting teens. It is a class E felony to make child pornography, so they would still be subject to adult charges for taking nude selfies. But it’s a class H felony to possess sexually explicit photos of minors, so possessing nude photos of themselves or others would be handled by juvenile court.\nIn adult court, punishments can include long prison terms.\nTeens judged delinquent in juvenile court can be held in any of several state institutions and group homes designed for youth, but only through age 21. Some who avoid incarceration are put on electronic monitoring.\nYouth in juvenile court get counselors who assess whether they need assistance to straighten out, such as mental health treatment, said Stiehl, the District Court judge.\nStart-up costs\nThe House plan would cost about $25.3 million in the upcoming fiscal year and $44.4 million in the 2021-22 fiscal year, the legislative staff said. And that doesn’t count expenses that local governments may incur, such as sheriff’s offices that hire more juvenile officers.\nThe legislature’s staff estimated that 11,862 teens age 16 and 17, accused of a total 21,236 crimes, are arrested annually on the misdemeanor and lower-level felony charges addressed in the House version of the Raise the Age bill. Almost 8,000 of those teens would eventually end up in juvenile court after dismissals or diversion programs. That means the juvenile justice system will need an infusion of cash.\nThe first $25.3 million of Raise the Age spending would be to build a 96-bed, 151-employee facility called a youth development center to incarcerate teens ruled responsible for violent crimes or other serious offenses, and those with a lengthy history of crime. North Carolina has four of these centers already with a total of 247 beds.\nYouth development centers are described by the state as secure facilities that provide education and treatment services, essentially prisons for juvenile offenders.\nThe new center is projected to cost $11.6 million a year to operate.\nThere will be other projected expenses, such as 240 new juvenile court counselors, 22 supervisors and 22 assistants for them. Juvenile cases take more courtroom time than adult cases, the research staff said, so courts would need to hire additional judges, prosecutors, court clerks and legal assistants, plus pay defense lawyers to defend indigent teens.\nIn the end, Raise the Age is projected to require more than 460 personnel to implement.\nAdvocates argue that in the long run, the costs will be offset by the benefit to society — more people diverted away from a life of crime and instead earning money in the workforce and paying taxes.\nCumberland County Public Defender Bernard Condlin is one of those advocates\n“To have young persons carry this cross for the next 50 or 60 years, to me is a little bit outrageous,” Condlin said.\nMost teenagers learn their lesson after their first arrest, Condlin said, and don’t get in trouble again.\nCondlin recalled Cumberland County recently held a clinic called Project Fresh Start to help people get their criminal records expunged. “Of that group of people there’s a large subset that were under the age of 18” when they committed their crimes, he said.\n“Ten years later they can’t ever get a job that pays more than $12 an hour,” he said.\nStaff writer Paul Woolverton can be reached at pwoolverton@fayobserver.com, 910-486-3512 and 910-261-4710."},{"url":"http://www.caller.com/story/news/local/2017/06/01/am-american-terry-mills-wants-remove-barriers-between-youth-police/100319918","title":"I Am an American: Terry Mills wants to remove barriers between youth, police","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Corpus Christi Caller-Times","description":"Terry Mills didn't want Corpus Christi to join the growing list of towns saddled with a reputation for unrest between law enforcement and young people.","date":"","full_text":"Rachel Denny Clow\nEach week, this series will introduce you to an exceptional American who unites our communities.

But the potential always seemed to exist, Mills said, even in a bayside community dotted with refineries, fishing docks and taco restaurants.\nMills set up the first Youth Summit in Corpus Christi. In April, his efforts were recognized with the 2016 FBI Director’s Community Leadership Award.\n\"If you're Hispanic, Muslim, black or other, you get pulled over (by the cops) and you have to throw your hands up in the air. I'm like 'This is crazy. ... this is not the America that I know,' \" Mills said. \"I got tired of seeing that throughout the United States. I said we need to come together as one. I want to get in front of a problem before something erupts, instead of being behind the problem after it already (has) taken place.\"\nThe summit brought teens from all over Texas' Coastal Bend under the same roof with police officers, lawyers from the U.S. Attorney's Office and even FBI agents. The aim was to help guide youths on how to make good decisions.\nTopics ran the gamut, and the talk at times was frank. But to hear Mills describe it, the dialogue was also necessary to both build relationships and to head off an \"us vs. them\" division between youth and law enforcement.\n\"We need to work smarter and not harder,\" Mills said. \"All I care about is fairness. I still believe in America. I still believe that in Corpus Christi you've got some like-minded people that want to see things better for everybody.

The heartbeat of the program is strong. The guys are motivated to be really good. I love when there’s a lot of negativity in the air and people write us off because that’s where we’re at our best.”\nMika, TJ Haws, and Nick Emery comprised the “Lone Peak Three,” and they had lofty expectations placed upon them in terms of what they could accomplish together at BYU after guiding Lone Peak High to a national championship in 2013.\nIn mid-May, Mika hired an agent and opted to keep his name in the draft. The Cougars will certainly miss the 20.3 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game that he posted last season.\nHaws is happy Mika is pursuing his NBA dreams — but he’s also looking ahead.\n“I’m very excited for Eric to keep moving on and keep doing his thing. But there’s no stopping here,” he said. “I feel like our team next year is going to be very good and I’m sure we’re going to play different basketball next year, which I think will be great for our personnel. We’ll be just fine. It’s pretty motivating as a player to hear that you’re not going to be that great without someone. We’re using that as motivation ... There’s a lot of energy right now. There’s a lot of excitement. Sometimes change can be a really good thing. I’m excited to get going this summer with everyone.”\nIn April, assistant coach Terry Nashif left the staff to take a job in the private sector. He was later replaced by Heath Schroyer, who had been an assistant at BYU from 1997-2001, when he oversaw the defense.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done\nWhat impact will Schroyer have on the program?\n“What I’ve seen so far has been great. He brings a lot of energy,” Haws said. “I’ve sat down and talked to him a little bit. He’s very intelligent. I like the way he thinks offensively and defensively. I really enjoyed talking to him about hoops and he brings a great perspective to this program.”\nMeanwhile, BYU has seen the return of guard Zac Seljaas from a mission and the signings of sophomore Jahshire Hardnett, a 6-foot guard from Chipola College in Florida, and freshman Rylan Bergersen.\nBYU will enter the 2017-18 season with six scholarship players returning — Haws, Nick Emery, Elijah Bryant, Yoeli Childs, Payton Dastrup and Braiden Shaw.\nRyan Andrus, Dalton Nixon and Luke Worthington have also returned home from missions.\nLaComb is confident in what the Cougars can accomplish next season under Rose, who has won a total of 305 games in Provo — an average of 25 wins per season.\n“One of the things, if you look at the history of coach Rose’s time here, one thing that’s stayed constant, is we’ve always put a really competitive product on the floor,” he said. “When I first got here, people asked me, ‘How are you going to win without Trent Plaisted? How are you going to win without Lee Cummard? How are you going to win without Jonathan Tavernari? How are you going to win without Jimmer Fredette? Jackson Emery? Tyler Haws? Kyle Collinsworth? Year in and year out, the constant is coach Rose.”\nNow, people are wondering how BYU will do without Mika. The Cougars are expected to return to a more guard-oriented offense next season.\n“Having Eric leave, a lot changes,” Haws said. “I think we’ll have more space and we’ll play more open and free. That’s really good for the personnel that we have and the guards we have.”\n“Guys have a real excitement because with Eric making the decision he made, and we’re really happy for him and support him,” LaComb said. “But it’s one of those deals where people say, ‘Who’s going to replace all that?’ I think our reaction is, it’s what we deal with every year. You just get to work. We’re all getting familiar with each other and it’s been positive.”\nHaws returned home from his mission in France in March 2016 and worked hard to get ready for last season. After averaging 13.8 points per game as a freshman, he has had more time to get stronger and hone his game.\n“It’s a long process getting back in shape and getting your body to where you want it to be,” Haws said. “I feel like I’m much more ahead than I was at this time last year. I’m starting at a point that I want to start at. It’s huge for me and I’m excited for this offseason.”\nBYU is still looking to reach certain benchmarks. In six seasons as members of the West Coast Conference, the Cougars haven't captured a regular-season or conference tournament championship.\nBYU knocked off the No. 1-ranked Zags, and handed them their first loss, in the regular-season finale last February. It marked the Cougars' third straight win in Spokane. Then came the humbling 80-51 loss to Saint Mary’s in the WCC Tournament semifinals.\nAfter going to the NCAA Tournament for eight of nine years, BYU is coming off back-to-back NIT appearances. Last March, the Cougars were eliminated from the NIT in the first round at home by Texas Arlington, 105-89.\nMany of BYU’s players have headed home for a break before they reconvene in late June.\n“We’ll get guys here June 26 for the summer. We’ll have everyone that’s on the roster in school,” LaComb said. “We’ve had some really good signings that will help us. I have a lot of confidence in guys coming back. The mix of all that is really exciting for us.”\nCould the Cougars add other players prior to the start of fall semester? BYU hosted a couple of prospects in May though no offers were extended.\n“We’re always looking, always recruiting,” LaComb said. “We’re looking for the exact right fit. If we find that, we could add someone. As of now, there’s nothing imminent.”\nAs the Cougars experience an offseason of big changes, LaComb likes the direction the program is heading. “Things,” he said, “are in a really good place.”"},{"url":"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/millions-underemployment-new-normal","title":"For millions, underemployment is a new normal","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"PBS NewsHour","description":"At 4.3 percent, the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 2001.

Before starting as an assistant manager at this Chicago Walgreens, making ends meet meant working an exhaustive number of hours between two jobs, one at McDonald’s, the other at women’s clothing store Layne Bryant.\nLAYMONDRA BREWER-THOMAS: My schedule was all over the place. Between 32 to 40 hours with McDonald’s. Lane Bryant, I wanna say maybe 20 hours out of the week. So I was juggling both jobs at the time. It was stressful. It was overwhelming at times, because I wasn’t where I wanted to be.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Brewer-Thomas’ work situation exemplifies a new normal for millions of American workers, underemployment.\nThe national unemployment rate has dropped from its great recession peak of ten percent to 4.3 percent. But if you include people who have stopped looking in the last month or those involuntarily working only part-time, you get the nation’s underemployment rate. It was 17.1 percent at the peak of the recession. Today it is at 8.4 percent.\nBob Bruno is a labor and employment relations professor at the University of Illinois.\nBOB BRUNO: While it’s true that the unemployment rate has been halved, and that’s all to the good, to some degree it really is masking some real difficulty that workers are having out there in the economy.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: In Illinois, the underemployment rate is one of the highest in the country, averaging 10.3 percent since last year.\nThat’s something Ronald Jackson knows all too well. The 54 years-old, Illinois native feels he has many more years of work left in him, the problem is finding a company willing to give him a full-time job.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: How stable has it been for you?\nRONALD JACKSON: You don’t know if you will be there one minute, or the next because they can say, ‘Well, we only need you for one week.’ Most of the workers doesn’t, they can’t plan. They just have to go day by day, and hopefully that, you know, they’re still working.”\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Currently in between jobs, Jackson spent much of 2016 in a patchwork of jobs. This past fall, Jackson was working at this pallet supply company earning $350 every week with no benefits. That job ended after three months.\nRONALD JACKSON: Most jobs will not even hire you for a full 40 hours. They’ll give you 25 hours. And who’s gonna wanna work for 25 hours and that’s right is bus fare already gone. After you take out the taxes. So there’s not saying that there’s jobs out here. Where? I mean, people wanna work, but if I’ma work, I need 40 hours.\nBOB BRUNO: Part-time used to be temporarily, and it used to be a gauge. People start back to work part time. It builds into full time. People who want full time can find it. And people who stay part time are voluntarily choosing to be in that. But we’re finding that’s not the reality anymore.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: How does this impact the economics of a working family?\nBOB BRUNO: There is nothing but insecurity. There’s instability constantly. You can’t feel comfortable at any point in time with the hours you’ve been assigned or the income you’ve earned. Because it’s never enough. How a middle class emerges out of this population really is an open question.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: That question led Laymondra Brewer-Thomas to Skills for Chicagoland’s Future, a public-private partnership that works with the more than 50 Chicago area companies, like Walgreens and Chase bank to fill vacancies with qualified, unemployed, or underemployed job seekers.\nMarie Lynch is the group’s CEO.\nHow common is Laymondra’s story?\nMARIE LYNCH: Very common. On an annual basis , we find about 35 percent of the 1,100 people we serve are underemployed, the folks who are either not working full time or are working at a wage or type of job that was less than they previously were at prior to the recession.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Shortly after connecting with Skills for Chicagoland’s Future, Brewer-Thomas got her interview with Walgreens.\nToday, she’s relieved to be working there full-time with health care benefits and a retirement plan, with the goal of becoming a store manager.\nLAYMONDRA BREWER-THOMAS: It’s a lot more challenging now to actually find employment and to find employment that may be best suited for your needs.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Did you feel beforehand that you had a jobs network or an employment network that you could tap into?\nLAYMONDRA BREWER-THOMAS: No. It was a struggle. Talking to individuals I went to school with, friends and colleagues and etcetera. A lot of them were in the same boat that I was in at the time, and are still in the same boat that I previously was in.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Has there been a systemic shift in the way that companies manage their workforce? Is this emphasis on a part-time, scalable workforce something that’s shifted within management thinking?\nMARIE LYNCH: I think that there has been some structural changes to how they’re approaching work, you know? And to what I saw early on was really an attempt to manage risk and to be cautious as they were, you know, coming out of that recession.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: For companies, managing risk means managing labor costs, including the number of hours people work and many companies have adopted computer software to help them do that.\nDayforce is a program used by about 3,500 companies, like retailers Guitar Center and Sephora.\nJohn Orr is a Senior Vice President of Ceridian, the company behind the software.\nJOHN ORR: It really optimizes, who they put where, when and what skills and information they need.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: He says Dayforce enables employers to quickly respond to shifts in their respective markets and adjust to their employees’ needs.\nJOHN ORR: What we have done is we have come to the market with Dayforce that allows the business side to optimize its people, in part-time or shorter hour increments but at the same time to allow the employee to get the hours. If they’re only allowed to get 15 hours in this location but they can get another 15 at another location and the employee wants 30 hours, our system is smart enough to know how to do that.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: This flexible scheduling ability came as the retail industry – which employs over 3 million people in America has increasingly relied on part-time workers.\nMark Cohen used to be the CEO of Sears in Canada and is now an industry consultant and Columbia University business school professor.\nMARK COHEN: You need somebody to open the door in the morning someone to lock the door at night. But you really want to staff your physical space when the customers shopping and to the degree that folks have been able to predict that. That’s been the basis for increased part-time employee.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Is there evidence that productivity increases if you have workers that are working at 30 or fewer hours a week. Or is productivity higher if workers are in a full-time capacity?.\nMARK COHEN: This is a difficult, difficult issue. There’s no formulaic solution. There are organizations that hold their full time employees dearly. And so they pay the price of a dip in business, and they keep those folks employed. There are other folks who track on a more point to point basis they fire and hire, and I think they’re probably characterized as penny wise and pound foolish. They appear to be operating more efficiently but they pay an enormous cost in hiring retraining and turnover.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: With retail stores struggling against competition from internet shopping, Cohen predicts increased instability for those employed in the retail sector.\nMARK COHEN: So, right now you can shop online with a keyboard and I would say in a couple of years you’ll start shopping online with a headset that lets you walk through a store whether it’s real or virtual point to something that interests you pick it up virtually and then decide to buy it.\nCHRIS BOOKER: Really represents a dark shadow for the person that works in a mall or the floor of a clothing store?\nMARK COHEN: Absolutely.\nCHRISTOPHER BOOKER: Do you think, had you not found Skills for Chicagoland’s Future, you would be where you are?\nLAYMONDRA BREWER-THOMAS: I’m not sure. It’s definitely put me at a different level. I could still be juggling between two jobs or still attempting to find something that’s better suited for my needs and wants. And my career path in general. So I know I would keep pushing but, you know, I’m not sure.\nChasing the Dream: Poverty and Opportunity in America is a multi-platform public media initiative that provides a deeper understanding of the impact of poverty on American society.

Her voice was constricted as she loaded medication into a device about the size of her palm.\n“Capsule in. You close it and you push this blue button,” Milton said, demonstrating how the device punctures the pill. She then takes two labored breaths to inhale the powder inside the capsule. “And that’s it.”\nMilton, like many Medicare enrollees, is on a fixed income. She has $2,000 a month to pay for a mortgage, car payment, Medicare premiums and other expenses.\n“I got to stretch out that, plus I have the less costly medicines that I have to pay for and also my oxygen,” Milton said. “You can only stretch it so far.”\nAn estimated 1 in 9 Medicare beneficiaries are diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. And, in 2014, COPD was the third-leading cause of death in the country, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Inhalers like Spiriva and Advair account for billions in Medicare spending each year.\nYet, even if responsible only for monthly copays, many enrollees like Milton can’t afford their inhalers. Milton depends on free samples provided by her doctor for her prescription of Breo Ellipta — the supply is limited, so she regularly skips one of the two daily doses. And she received one year’s worth of free samples for Spiriva after applying for drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim’s financial assistance program.\nMilton was down to two doses of Spiriva one recent morning. Holding up a silver sleeve of medication, Milton said: “This is all I have left. So, if [the drugmaker doesn’t] approve me for this year, I’m going to have to ask Dr. Stigall if there’s something else I can take.”\nThat would be Dr. Brian Stigall of Hill Country Medical Associates in New Braunfels, Texas, who keeps a closet full of free drug samples for patients like Milton.\n“Thank goodness, the drug reps are good. They bring us lots of samples,” Stigall said. “I save those samples back for those Medicare patients.”\nWithout the inhalers, patients suffer, he said. “They are going to end up back in the hospital and they’re going to end up seeing me much more often.”\nPatients who suffer a full-blown attack, due to low oxygen intake, could need three to seven days of emergency treatment, Stigall said.\nRetiree Ken Wagar, who lives in Winter Haven, Fla., buys his inhalers overseas. Instead of paying Medicare copays of more than $500 for three-month supplies of Advair and Spiriva, Wagar pays $248 for the same amount of Advair and $73 for Spiriva.\n“It’s common and easy,” said Wagar, 68. “You have to order in advance because it takes awhile to ship. … You do what you have to do.”\nAcross the country, doctors who treat COPD said costs are a common problem for patients. Dr. David Mannino at the University of Kentucky College of Public Health said some patients cut pills in half or take a prescription once a day instead of twice, just to save money.\nDr. Momen Wahidi, a pulmonologist at Duke University School of Medicine, said many patients “weren’t able to use [an inhaler because they] couldn’t get it, couldn’t afford it.”\nDr. Peter Castaldi of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston surveyed thousands of Medicare patients in 2006. Up to a third said they couldn’t take their medication because of cost.\n“Even at a relatively seemingly low amount of $20-per-month out-of-pocket costs, you could see the effects of cost on people being able to take their medications,” Castaldi said.\nAnd prices have only increased since 2006. Spiriva’s list price has jumped 31 percent the past five years to $368 for a 30-day supply, according to drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim. And Breo Ellipta’s price has risen 20 percent since 2013 to $321.74 a month, according to drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline.\nSpokespeople for both drug companies said insured patients would not pay those prices because of discounts, rebates and other price concessions negotiated with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. For example, GlaxoSmithKline estimated that the average out-of-pocket cost for patients with Medicare’s drug coverage, Medicare Part D, was $33 in 2015, when the drug’s list price was $281 for a month’s supply.\nBut it’s “not unusual [for patients] to be on more than one inhaler” and those costs add up, said Dr. Chien-Wen Tseng, with the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine and the Pacific Health Research and Education Institute.\nIn a recent letter published in JAMA Internal Medicine, Tseng analyzed Medicare’s prescription drug formularies in 2015 and the projected cost of deductibles and copays. She found that Medicare Part D beneficiaries with multiple inhalers could spend more than $2,800 in out-of-pocket costs annually.\nThe high price of inhalers is expensive for the Medicare program and “drives people into the doughnut hole,” she said. The dreaded doughnut hole is a coverage gap for Medicare Part D patients. Enrollees pay more for drugs out-of-pocket once the coverage gap is reached.\n“Medicare Part D was really designed in 2006 with 2006 prices,” Tseng said. In 2017, with much higher drug prices, “does Medicare Part D really still work?” she asked.\nFor Milton, the answer seems obvious: It doesn’t. Most mornings after taking her Spiriva, Milton sits on her back patio. There, she talks with God.\n“I don’t pray,” she said. “I talk. I carry on a conversation.”\nAnd that conversation often turns to her struggles with COPD.\n“I understand and I have to accept it. I know that it was my doing,” Milton said, adding, “everything is in his hands.”\nKHN’s coverage of prescription drug development, costs and pricing is supported in part by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.\nEditor’s note: After this story was published, GlaxoSmithKline, which manufactures Breo Ellipta, noted that the drug is not intended for twice-daily use."},{"url":"http://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/2017/05/30/downtown-businesses-see-little-impact-following-shooting/356242001","title":"Downtown businesses see little impact following shooting","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Post-Crescent Media","description":"Appleton business owners say isolated incidents will not deter regular customers.","date":"","full_text":"Madeleine Behr/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\nAPPLETON - Violent late-night incidents downtown over the past four years appear to have had little effect on businesses.\nIn the bigger picture, it appears downtown bar-hoppers don’t want to abandon their favorite evening hang-outs.\nOver the past week, business owners in the vicinity of Jack’s Apple Pub, site of a fatal shooting on May 21, have had to deal with bad publicity and unsubstantiated rumors.\nBut if it follows the patterns after a fatal shooting at Luna Lounge in 2013 and a stabbing at Antro Nightclub in 2014, they know things will return to normal.\n“People see it as an isolated incident. I don’t think business is affected much,” said Paul VanderLinden, owner of Muncheez Pizzeria, a post-bar staple kitty-corner from Jack’s Apple Pub. “My staff is hearing from people that they’re still going to come downtown.”\nHis Memorial Day weekend business was higher on Saturday, then took a small dip Sunday.\nNext door to Jack’s Apple Pub, C-Vine Lounge was the subject of false rumors.\nCo-owner Conrado Lopez said he found stories circulating in social media that the shooting occurred at his Latin music dance club.\n“We tried to reach them on Snapchat and Facebook. We linked to the police report so they could see it didn’t happen here. Those people apologized to us and said they heard it from friends,” he said.\n“I don’t want to say it affected us, but I can see there was a change,” Lopez said. “Every year we get busier on Memorial Day weekend and it wasn’t like that this year. It was like a normal Saturday and we don’t know if it was because of that.”\nLopez said business was down about 30 percent, judging by the size of the crowd and bar sales.\nC-Vine Lounge is one of several businesses downtown that has taken strong proactive measures to keep the peace. It has a metal detector at the door and five bouncers on at a time. It posts rules on its window.\n“We check everybody every time, no matter how many times they go outside,” Lopez said. “We check bags. We have a dress code. We’ve been doing that since day one because we want to avoid those issues. Ninety-five percent of our customers feel safe when they’re in our place.”\nVanderLinden remembers the Luna and Antro incidents and recalls that neither one had a long-term impact.\n“Policies and ordinances affect us more,” he said.\n“The smoking ban affected bar businesses and some restaurants.

The records label the protestors “jihadists” and seek to justify escalating action against them.\nThe activities of the company spanned, but were not limited to, the four states through which the pipeline passes: South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois. The documents also show that its surveillance efforts continued after the breakup of the Standing Rock camps this winter, including at ongoing pipeline protests in southeastern Pennsylvania, Iowa, and South Dakota.\nThe internal documents from the firm, called TigerSwan, take the form of situation reports, or “sitreps,” prepared between September and April for its employer, Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners. The records detail a range of tactics that experts from the American Civil Liberties Union, National Lawyers Guild, and Electronic Frontier Foundation say would likely be illegal if conducted by law enforcement.\nA private security company probably doesn’t face the same prohibitions, legal scholars say, but the close collaboration between TigerSwan and local, state, and federal authorities detailed in the firm’s internal reports raised red flags with them. Several legal experts described the contractor’s tactics as highly disturbing and perhaps unprecedented.\n“It’s like a big brother society, with a private corporation — with even less restraints than the government — totally interfering with our right to privacy, free speech, assembly, and religious freedom,” said prominent civil rights attorney Jeff Haas, who works with the National Lawyers Guild and represents several of the nearly 800 people arrested while opposing the pipeline.\nIf the government can’t do it, he added, “Why should a private corporation working for another private corporation be able to?”\nTigerSwan did not respond to requests for comment. Energy Transfer Partners said it would not answer questions related to its security procedures, but acknowledged that it had shared some information with law enforcement.\nDakota Access is expected to begin shipping oil today.\nThe tactics used against the self-described “water protectors” were first reported last weekend by The Intercept, which based its coverage on documents provided by a contractor who worked with TigerSwan, according to the news outlet. Grist independently obtained more than a dozen similar documents prior to The Intercept’s report.\nAccording to the situation reports provided to Grist, TigerSwan also conducted surveillance of a church in Chicago, a 17-year-old girl in Iowa, and an AmeriCorps volunteer in Akron, among others. Reports of the actress Woodley’s arrest and the number of social media views she racked up were included in the reports.\nThe company specifically focused some of its most intense efforts on people of color — including Native American groups (like the Red Warrior Society and the American Indian Movement), members of Black Lives Matter, Palestinian activists, and those it labeled as “Islamists.”\nSeveral of TigerSwan’s targets expressed surprise and outrage when informed of the surveillance against them, but also vowed to defy efforts at intimidation. “This is crazy!” said 21-year-old Alex Cohen, an Iowa activist named in the reports, which detail tracking him and his group’s movements and activities. At least some of TigerSwan’s knowledge could only have been gained through direct infiltration, he said.\nA 17-year-old member of Cohen’s group was also included among the tracking reports. She was flattered when told the company considered her a threat. “I think it feels amazing that they are intimidated enough — not only by myself but by my friends — to write this!”\nIn addition to intrusive surveillance, the leaked documents reveal that the security firm attempted to create divisions between activists, manipulate and discredit pipeline opponents, and collect evidence that law enforcement could use to prosecute Standing Rock activists.\nThe ACLU’s human rights program director, Jamil Dakwar, said the records obtained by the news outlets suggest the company was painting an exaggerated picture to persuade both Energy Transfer Partners and law enforcement to take a more aggressive stance against those opposing the pipeline. “They are operating with no transparency, no accountability,” Dakwar said.\nSelf-defense or ‘hand-to-hand combat’\nLast September, security guards employed by a company called Silverton deployed dogs against demonstrators near Standing Rock, resulting in several injuries, negative media attention (Democracy Now! caught them on camera), and an investigation — the dog handlers “were not registered as security officers” in the state of North Dakota, according to local officials.\nEnergy Transfer Partners appears to have responded by putting TigerSwan in charge of Dakota Access security, consolidating several contractors under its umbrella — including Silverton, which kept operating even after the dog incident, according to the leaked documents.\nA private military, government, and corporate security contractor based in Apex, N.C., TigerSwan was founded in 2007. Over the past five years, the company has worked on nearly 40 U.S. government contracts, totaling $10 million.\nIn 2013, CNBC profiled the company as it began to take on corporate clients concerned by cybersecurity threats. By 2011, half of TigerSwan’s business was for corporations.\nRetired Lt. Col. Jim Reese co-founded TigerSwan and serves as its chairman. He’s a veteran of the Army’s elite Delta Force, which is best known for killing Osama Bin Laden in 2011. During the Iraq War, he led a task force targeting al Qaeda members, and he was a sought-after advisor throughout the war in Afghanistan. Reese’s name is now being pitched for FBI director.\nA $1 billion State Department contract from 2005 names Reese as “key personnel” working for Blackwater, the controversial contractor now known as Academi. McClatchy reports that in 2007, as Blackwater was under investigation for the deaths of 11 Iraqi civilians, it canceled a deal to buy farmland for a training ground near California’s Fort Bragg. TigerSwan instead bought the property with financing from Blackwater.\nBased in North Carolina, TigerSwan has offices throughout the world, tens of millions of dollars worth of contracts with the federal government for security services abroad, and an Army Special Forces veteran as its chairman. (Read more about the company below.)\nMany of the Standing Rock supporters named in the TigerSwan situation reports told Grist they had no idea that they had been the subject of surveillance by the company — and some disputed much of what the firm reported about them.\n“This company is demented,” said Clayton Thomas-Müller, a member of the Canadian Mathias Colomb Cree Nation, and a campaigner with 350.org — a nonprofit organization frequently cited in the reports. TigerSwan reported on Thomas-Müller’s trip to the camps, though his purpose was simply to bring donated clothes from Winnipeg to the protestors at Standing Rock, he said.\nIn September, the leaked documents show, TigerSwan set up an “information operations campaign” targeting the Standing Rock activists — which, according to the nonprofit RAND Corporation, is defined in military and security circles as including “the collection of tactical information about an adversary as well as the dissemination of propaganda in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent.”\nTigerSwan’s Oct. 3 report describes trying to delegitimize the protests by exploiting “ongoing native versus non-native rifts, and tribal rifts between peaceful and violent elements.” Several situation reports also refer to “source reporting” and “informant collection,” suggesting the use of infiltrators to gather information from within the Standing Rock camps and protest groups.\nThe documents often portray protesters in what their targets say are exaggerated terms, apparently to inflate the potential danger they posed. For example, the Nov. 9 report ominously warns: “An element of the Black Panther Party from Chicago is active within the camps in ND. A member of that delegation led 30–40 activists in hand-to-hand combat training in Camp 2.”\n“That’s definitely talking about me,” Kelly Hayes said when read the report over the phone. “But that’s definitely a misrepresentation.”\nHayes is a member of the Menominee Tribe; she’s not a Black Panther, she told me, identifying herself as part of a collective of indigenous and black organizers from Chicago “aimed at the defense of communities of color.” She taught what she describes as several “small pockets of women and fem folks” very basic self-defense classes, adding that she has never engaged in violent action.\nThe classes she taught were not advertised in the camp or on social media. “It was a word-of-mouth thing,” she said, and thus could only have been reported from someone on the ground in the camps.\n“That really does say something about how infiltrated everything must have been,” she said. “It really just shows you that every step people took out there, they were under constant scrutiny and surveillance.”\nHayes made several trips to Standing Rock, the first during the early stages of the movement in spring 2016, when there were no more than a few dozen people at the camps — which later grew to house thousands. She ran the first direct action and blockade training sessions at Standing Rock, and came back subsequently to run more.\n“We are educators, and we are protesters, and we are community members — and we’re doing movement work,” she said. “It sounds to me like these for-profit individuals were trying to make things sound more exciting and important to impress their employers.”\nTigerSwan’s activities also reached well beyond the protest camps. A significant portion of the Nov. 11 situation report, for instance, is devoted to monitoring organizations and people of interest to the firm in the greater Chicago area, including the surveillance of a “local anti-DAPL church” and people who protested in the wake of Donald Trump victory in last year’s presidential election.\nThe company also reported on anti-pipeline sentiments at a second church in Illinois’ capital, Springfield, and, according to an earlier situation report, was probing links between Black Lives Matter Chicago and groups at local universities that it discovered via social media.\n“I’m not entirely surprised that they would hone in on the black and brown organizing,” Hayes said. “They’re spending a lot of money, right, to infiltrate and figure out who we are and how we connect? That fear comes from a recognition of our power.”\nIs any of this even legal?\nU.S. laws regarding surveillance and other counterintelligence tactics don’t appear to specifically govern TigerSwan, an overseas military contractor operating as a private security force on American soil.\nSeveral legal experts said the example it presents might be unprecedented. What happens when “private police” share information and act in concert with — or potentially at the behest of — public law enforcement agencies, but are not covered by the same laws?\nThat’s the sort of question that Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government asked police chiefs from across the country to consider at a 2014 symposium. The chiefs concluded that it would be a bad idea to hire an elite special-forces unit recently demobilized from Afghanistan to provide hostage-rescue services to a city police department.\n“Military units are more oriented toward the use of decisive force against enemies, and less toward apprehending violators and achieving peaceful solutions,” the police chiefs reasoned. The private companies, they said, had profit motivation that could create “perverse incentives.”\nLegal experts told Grist that the same sort of concerns apply to TigerSwan’s involvement at Standing Rock — especially as detailed in the leaked “situation report” documents.\nTigerSwan’s Oct. 10 report, for example, says that its “social media cell has harnessed a URL coding technique to discover hidden profiles and groups associated with the protesters allowing the firm to access private social media information. … Self-incriminating information can be gathered on protesters to be used at a later date.” TigerSwan gained access to a private Facebook page created by Cohen’s group, Mississippi Stand, which provided information on rides to get members to protests.\n“If they were getting unauthorized access to Facebook profiles — not the public stuff, but things that they shouldn’t have — then that could potentially be a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the federal anti-hacking law,” said David Greene, senior staff attorney and civil liberties director at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nGreene said that if TigerSwan simply exploited a Facebook vulnerability, it wouldn’t be a violation. The company would have had to break a security measure that the social network had in place for it to be a legal matter — and it’s unclear if that happened, based on the limited details provided in the records.\nStephanie Lacambra, a criminal defense attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the activities are potentially serious enough, however, that a subpoena should be sought to find out exactly what TigerSwan did.\nGreen added that “people who were spied on might have private causes of action. A typical cause of action might be for intrusion — the idea that their privacy was violated in a way that was sort of highly offensive.”\nJeff Haas with the National Lawyers Guild said he’s particularly concerned about the relationship between TigerSwan and law enforcement agencies. The documents provided to Grist detail multiple occasions that the firm met with or shared information with police and sheriff’s departments.\nThe Morton County Sheriff’s Department — where Standing Rock is located — told Grist that it communicated with TigerSwan “in order to monitor and respond to illegal protest activity.” But it asserted that the sheriff’s department was responsible for maintaining safety on public land, while TigerSwan ran security on DAPL property.\n“For a while, the courts have ruled that you’re not entitled to infiltrate or spy on people unless you have probable cause to believe they’ve committed a crime,” Haas said. “The government couldn’t meet that standard probably here.”\nBut the information provided by TigerSwan could have helped police forces overcome that prohibition. Elizabeth Joh, a private security legal scholar at the University of California, Davis, referred to such techniques as a “potential end run on the basic constitutional restraints we place upon police.”\nHaas agreed. “It’s like we have a second level of government interference of surveillance that’s shared with official government forces, but how do you control that? I’m not sure the law is totally clear, but this could be a way to basically get around the Constitution. And until these documents got leaked, it was certainly a way to get around the public knowing about it.”\n‘We have sources in the camp’\nJoye Braun, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, hatched the idea that would become the Dakota Access resistance camps around Easter 2016. She felt frustrated that Energy Transfer Partners was ignoring tribal sovereignty, threatening sacred land, and cutting directly under Lake Oahe — the primary drinking water source for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and millions more people downstream.\nOn April 1, she and others raised the first yurts on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and along the shore of the Missouri River. Apart from a few trips home “to do laundry,” Braun said, she never left the camps until hospitalized for pneumonia nearly one year later, in late February 2017. She was one of the last people to go.\n“Very early on,” Braun recalled, “I can remember sitting around the fire talking hypothetically: ‘What if they start using the things they did to the Iraq or Afghanistan people on us?’ We all laughed and said, ‘We are all Lakota and Dakota! We’ll survive!’”\nAs it happens, that talk around the fire turned prophetic.\nAfter the Standing Rock encampments shut down at the end of February, Braun helped found the Cheyenne River camp in Eagle Butte, South Dakota, about a block away from her home. It’s a place to continue the resistance to Dakota Access (which still faces legal challenges) and prepare opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, authorized by President Trump shortly after his inauguration.\nTigerSwan followed.\nThe April 9 situation report to Energy Transfer Partners states: “The Cheyenne River camp is much more organized than previous camps” and notes that its founders likely came from the ranks of the original Dakota Access protesters. It continues: “We have sources in the camp working to confirm this information.”\nNote: This story initially claimed the Army’s Delta Force was responsible for killing Osama bin Laden in 2011.

He was coming into the house at night, and I was in bed. He was dressed in black but I could see his face. He’d put me in this big black plastic garbage bag and tie it up,” the now-adult Jamie said.\nThe nightmare haunted her throughout her childhood.\nHer father was Richard W. Matt, a notorious killer.\nBut to Jamie, now Jamie Scalise, her father was a man shrouded in mystery. She has virtually no childhood memories of him, because he abandoned her and her mother when she was an infant.\nMatt was not known to harm children, but he relished his reputation as a brutal killer.\nWhen a prisoner’s hope is gone, the lure of freedom can be hard to resist. And life in a cell provides prisoners with the time, focus and physical hardness needed to pull off an escape.\nAfter getting in a dispute with a 76-year-old North Tonawanda businessman in 1997, he kidnapped the man, tortured him and then sawed off his head.\nOn the run in Mexico, he killed again while robbing a man in a strip club.\nTwo years ago this Monday, he and cop killer David P. Sweat escaped from a maximum-security prison in the Adirondacks. They led police on a three-week manhunt that commanded the nation’s attention and ended when a searcher shot and killed Matt. Sweat was later shot and captured.\nRetired North Tonawanda detectives who had put Matt behind bars were relieved. They feared that Matt would return to seek vengeance for being put behind bars.\nFor Jamie, Matt morphed from a dark mystery in her childhood when she first learned about him, to a curious figure when she was a young teen.\nAnd then when she became a young adult – a new wife and mother – she developed a strong bond with him while he was in prison.\nThey carried on a correspondence for several years. Curious and moved by his letters, she visited him in the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, where she got to learn more about him.\n[From the pen of a killer: Letters Richard Matt wrote to his daughter]\nMatt told Jamie repeatedly that he loved her and was deeply sorry for his failures as a father. He and another woman had a son, Nicholas Harris. Matt kept in better contact with Harris, who knew Matt just well enough to be afraid of him, than he did with Jamie.\nMatt told her about his horrible crimes. He told her about his life as a prisoner in Mexico and then in New York. He also said he was a changed man and that one day she would know him as a free man.\nThe 27-year-old mother of two young daughters says she condemns her father’s violent and manipulative past. She does not want to change opinions of him. But she was willing to tell her story about her relationship with Richard Matt for the first time to provide another view of someone who committed so many horrible crimes.\nShe also shared with The Buffalo News dozens of letters Matt sent her.\n“I knew what he did. I never approved of anything he did, but I grew to love him,” she said. “He was my father.”\nGrowing up\nJamie Ciffa first learned about her biological father when she was 9.\nHer mother sat her down to tell her that her father was a killer.\nLucille Ciffa-Longo said his name was name Richard Matt and that he had killed two men, one in Tonawanda and another in Mexico. She spared her daughter the gruesome details of the torture and beheading.\nBut just knowing he was a murderer was enough to fuel terrifying nightmares.\n“I was kind of in shock when my mother told me that my father was going to prison for murder,” Jamie said.\nShe had always known that there was a “bad reason” why he wasn’t part of her life.\nHer maternal grandparents – thoroughly disgusted with Matt – had paid to have her last name legally changed to theirs: Ciffa.\nWhile on the run in Mexico after killing the local businessman, Matt killed a man south of the border and was imprisoned in Mexico for nine years. Authorities believed Matt killed the man in a robbery-murder at a strip club in Matamoros, Mexico. Matt spotted the man with a wad of cash and followed him into the men’s room before stabbing him in the back, police said.\nBack in the City of Tonawanda, Lucille had remarried to Dan Longo. Jamie considered him her “real” father, and they had a loving family home on Duffy Drive, a suburban street filled with other families.\nBut the nightmares continued.\nThen in 2003, a letter arrived for Jamie, now 14. It was from Matt. This was his first contact with her since she was a baby.\n“My mom let me read the letter and then took it back, and I never saw it again. I did not write him. I didn’t feel like I was allowed to,” Jamie recalled.\nAfter confiding her father’s identity to her closest girlfriend, Jamie said she and her friend went to the City of Tonawanda library, where they could access a computer and the Internet to read about his crimes.\n“I went to my girlfriend because I didn’t feel I could go to my parents. My mother had just recently had my brother,” she said.\nAt the library, Jamie said she did a Google search on “Richard Matt” and printed out every newspaper story she could find on him. The two teenage girls then read all of the gory details.\nShe was shocked.\n“My girlfriend asked if I was OK and gave me a hug,” she recalled.\nJamie is not sure why, but at around this time, her nightmares gradually went away. And for the next several years, Jamie said she never discussed her father.\n“He became the skeleton in the closet that I never talked about.”\nShe went on with her own life.\nMatt tries again\nBy the time she was 21, Jamie had married her high school sweetheart, Stephen Scalise. She was a hairstylist and he was a contractor. They were in the process of buying their first home and looking forward to starting a family.\nAnother letter arrived in January 2011, postmarked Dannemora. Her father was reaching out to her again.\nMatt was now doing 25-to-life in the Clinton Correctional Facility for the killing of William Rickerson, the North Tonawanda businessman he had tortured and dismembered.\nThe letter, dated Jan. 29, 2011, began with an apology. Matt said he would understand if she wanted nothing to do with him. But if she was willing, he wanted to make up for the lost years.\nMatt went on to describe his time in the Mexican prison. He wrote that he was tortured because he was American. He said he did 27 months in solitary confinement, a cockroach-infested “hole.” Guards there spit and urinated on him from above and wondered aloud how long it would be before he went crazy, his letter said.\n“It was the type of place where you wish you were dead or someone would just kill you and end it all,” Matt wrote.\nHe also told his daughter how his memory of her sustained him.\n“You were and are the most important thing to me in life. Not a day went by down there and still does not go by that I don’t think of you.”\nThe letter touched Jamie.\n“It made me realize how important I was to this man. It hit a deep spot. I had kept him alive,” Jamie said.\nWanting to form her own opinion of her father, she wrote back and shared details about her life, including her childhood nightmares.\nMatt responded.\nHe said that he reread her letter six times and wept when he realized how much of her life he had missed. Matt also took responsibility for her nightmares.\n“One thing is for sure, Jamie, I would never kidnap you or let anyone hurt you. I would jump in front of a bullet without thinking twice to save you and if it ever came to it, I would give my life to save you.”\nMatt wrote about his passion, oil painting.\nHe said that he traded his artwork for food and other favors from prison workers.\n“Everyone in Clinton comes to me to get their work done including the guards. The guards bring me food from the outside. Sometimes pizza subs, etc., so it’s cool and works itself out,” he said.\nMatt offered to paint for her.\nRelationship blossoms\nThe correspondence increased. Matt wrote his daughter 68 letters over the next four years, filling 382 carefully handwritten pages.\nHe repeatedly apologized for his abandonment of her and accepted blame for the failure of the marriage between him and her mother. He said they broke up because of his cheating.\nMatt also described details of prison life and how he worked in the prison tailor shop stitching together prison uniforms.\n“The big tough Rick Matt works on a sewing machine. It pays $15 a week. But it gets me out of my cell all day. There’s not many options for work here. It’s a job and it keeps me busy and out of trouble.”\nIn another letter, Matt wrote of how he had tried in his own bizarre and violent way to be a good husband and father.\nHer mother had called Matt and complained that the tenants in the apartment above theirs were playing loud music and waking up their infant daughter. Matt told his wife not to call the cops and that he would be home shortly.\nMatt described how he showed up with a shotgun and confronted the noisy neighbors.\n“I kick the door in and there’s three guys in there,” Matt wrote. “I put the first out with a punch, the second guy went down from the butt end of the shotgun to the face, and the third took the barrel in his mouth as I rammed it in.\n“I knocked out a couple of his teeth and left the gun in his mouth as I kindly told him if he ever wakes my little girl up again or bothers my wife that I’ll blow his head off.”\nJamie recalled her mother once telling her the same story.\nShe appreciated her father’s honesty. She said he promised that he would always tell the truth when she asked him questions about his past, though he warned she might not always like his answers.\nKilling the boss\nAfter exchanging some letters, Jamie decided she wanted to meet her father.\nShe and husband visited him at the prison in Dannemora in July 2011.\nShe asked him why he had killed William Rickerson. Matt had always refused to discuss the murder in his letters.\nHe began by telling the couple that he and his accomplice, Lee E. Bates, had been drinking heavily and doing drugs before going to Rickerson’s North Tonawanda home, she said.\nMatt told her that Rickerson, a food broker who had fired him a few weeks before the Dec. 4, 1997, attack, owed him two paychecks.\n“He told us he believed there was money in the house and that they didn’t expect anyone to be home,” Jamie said of her father’s account. “But Rickerson was home, and he punched him.”\nMatt said the blow unintentionally broke Rickerson’s neck.\nBates, who pleaded guilty as an accomplice to the murder and served time in prison, had offered a different account. Bates said Matt robbed and tortured Rickerson with a knife sharpener before binding him with duct tape and throwing him into the trunk of Bates’ car.\nWhen Rickerson yanked out the car’s stereo speaker wires and began kicking and screaming during a 27-hour odyssey that took them into Pennsylvania and Ohio, Matt got out of the vehicle, opened the trunk, and snapped Rickerson’s neck, according to court testimony.\nWhen Matt finished telling them about Rickerson, Jamie said, her father leaned across their table in the prison visiting room, “as if he was going to whisper something.”\nWhen he was close enough, he slipped a gold cross on a necklace into her shirt pocket.\n“He told me the cross and necklace had belonged to his birth mother, Maria,” Jamie said. “I was nervous. I didn’t know what he was doing, and I didn’t want to get in trouble. But he told me the gold wouldn’t set off the prison metal detector.”\nShe decided to continue her relationship with her father based on the man he had become, she said, and not the man he had been.\nLetter of gratitude\nIn a letter that arrived soon after, Matt wrote his daughter to say how much he appreciated their visit.\n“The last two days I spent with you guys have been the most happiest days of my life in many years. Jamie you grew up into a very beautiful woman and a good person with a good heart. I’m real proud of you both,” the prisoner wrote.\nBut Matt said there had been some painful moments during the first visit.\n“… your questions were hard for me to answer because I feel shame in a lot I of what I did out there. But it is what it is and I told you the truth. I never want to lie to you Jamie. I never want you or Steve to lose respect for me in that aspect. I want trust between us, and I would like us to grow strong in our relationship.”\nHe ended the letter with a request, one he would make over and over in the coming years: asking if his daughter could set him up with a woman looking to have a relationship with a convict behind bars.\n“I really need to find myself a girlfriend,” he wrote.\nIn another letter, he asked Jamie to post a good-looking photo of him online in the hopes that it would attract interest from the opposite sex. He asked his daughter to say he was “open” when it came to race and hoped it would attract “some hot Latin babe.”\nMatt was known for his swarthy good looks and had a reputation for chatting up women. At the time in his mid-40s, he was vain about his appearance, his daughter said.\nMatt said he hoped that, if he found a girlfriend, they could marry and have “trailer visits” on the grounds of the prison.\nBut Jamie said she was not interested in assisting her father in his romantic life.\n“I didn’t think it was my job to get my father a girlfriend,” Jamie said.\nMatt sometimes in his letters complained about putting on weight. Yet he also described how on weekends, when prison supervisors were not around, he and another inmate on the honor block cooked elaborate meals.\nMatt said he would boil them up two pounds of spaghetti, add two cans of sauce, and chop in onions and garlic.\n“I don’t have any meatballs, but the pepperoni and salami will do,” he wrote.\nAfter these weekend feasts, Matt said he and his buddy smoked celebratory cigars.\nTidbits like this were casually mentioned in letters that, a few lines later, told of brutal fights between opposing inmate gangs. After one battle between the Crips and Bloods, Matt said a subsequent lockdown had ruined his dinner plans to cook a pot of rigatoni.\nIn his cell, Matt had a sign that stated: “Hacksaw’s Personal Stuff,” he told her.\nThat might well be a warning to others. Matt was not to be trifled with in prison, he said. He said that he had enough sway with corrections officers that he could ask them to leave doors ajar so an inmate could be targeted for attack.\nBut his gallows humor and boasting vanished, she said, when he wrote or spoke about spending the rest of his life in prison. When inmates serving life sentences had exhausted their appeals, he said, they often committed suicide.\nJoyce Mitchell calls\nMatt may not have wanted a blonde girlfriend on the outside, but he had one on the inside.\nDuring his work in the tailor shop, he cultivated a relationship with Joyce E. Mitchell, the shop supervisor. The two had a romantic relationship that included sex in the shop.\nMatt also persuaded the prison seamstress to call his daughter and serve as an intermediary between them.\nMatt could have spoken by phone directly to his daughter, but Jamie explained that she did not have a land line in her home, something that was necessary for accepting prison calls.\nMitchell’s first call to Jamie came in the later part of 2013. Mitchell said that she did not mind doing Matt this favor because he watched out for her in the prison, Jamie recalled.\nMitchell’s calls began with, “ ‘Your dad says hi and wanted to check in on you.’\n“I would say, ‘Tell my dad I said hi,’ and I’d fill her in on my life at that time to pass along to him,” Jamie said. “She would always message me on holidays, ‘Happy Thanksgiving,’ ‘Merry Christmas.’ ”\nWith this more immediate line of communication established, the letters between them became infrequent, she said.\nJamie’s own life had gotten busy with her first child and running a hair-styling business out her home.\nBut the love between father and daughter was solid. Matt tattooed her name onto his left forearm and sent her oil paintings. Among them was a portrait of her and her husband. Another was of the late actor James Gandolfini, who played Tony Soprano.\nMaking ready\nIn many letters to his daughter, Matt insisted that someday he would start a new life in Mexico.\nJamie said she never took her father’s statements seriously when he said he was going to escape from prison.\nMatt told her that, if he ever did escape, he had a way to contact her without putting her in danger.\n“He said that because he only paints in oil, that he would send me an anonymous painting done in watercolor and when I received that, I was to rinse it off and behind it would be his location and a way to contact him,” Jamie said.\nShe laughed it off.\n“I just figured it was a fantasy that every inmate has,” Jamie said.\nComing Monday: All hell broke loose in high-security Dannemora the morning of June 6, 2015."},{"url":"https://qz.com/996104/drinking-behavior-psychologists-say-your-drunk-personality-has-a-lot-in-common-with-your-sober-self","title":"Psychologists say your drunk personality has a lot in common with your sober self","author_text":"Cassie Werber","keywords":[],"publication_text":"Quartz","description":"The sense of sudden liberation that could push you to do something crazy; the worry that you might be acting outlandishly; a flooding of goodwill through the veins that makes you want to hug strangers.

But according to new research from the University of Missouri published in May in the journal Clinical Psychological Science, most of that doesn’t show—even when people are closely watched in test conditions by a small battery of trained observers.\nPlenty of previous research has found marked changes to behavior when people are drunk, with alterations like an increase in extraversion, and more risk-taking, particularly marked. All of that chimes with anecdotal experience. But many of those studies were based on after-the-fact reporting by subjects or people who knew them. This time, Missouri researchers set out to objectively measure drunk behavior by giving groups of friends vodka-laced Sprite in lab conditions, setting them tasks, and having strangers observe the performance.\nPeople in the drunk groups were observed to be more extroverted than those in the sober groups, with observers using a system that measures five factors of personality. They also found—though less conclusively—that drunk people seemed less neurotic. But in the three other areas studied—conscientiousness, openness, and agreeableness—the observers didn’t notice any difference.\nThere are many caveats here: The environment was atypical—not a friend’s house, for example, or a karaoke bar, though people were studied in friendship groups, and the sessions were run in the evening or on weekends. The dosage was standardized, with no aim to get the participants massively inebriated. The groups given alcohol were compared to other groups who remained sober, rather than participants being compared when sober and then when drunk.\nAnd the observers, while trained, didn’t know the participants. Personality is such a complex thing that subtle changes might only be obvious—and, annoying—to those who know us best. (Indeed, for anyone who thinks this might be a get-out clause for bad behavior, it probably isn’t: A marked change in personality when drinking is one of the markers of having a problematic, and possibly dependent, relationship with alcohol, the research said.)\nNotably, the researchers said, participants themselves did report that their levels of conscientiousness, openness and agreeableness changed after drinking. The simplest explanation, suggest the researchers, is that drinkers may experience the greatest change internally. Good news perhaps: On the way home from Friday office cocktails, you may not be quite the scattered and giggling public wreck you feel like."},{"url":"https://thedevelopmentset.com/in-the-middle-east-being-hiv-positive-is-enough-to-deport-you-c481b2af40cf","title":"In the Middle East, Being HIV Positive Is Enough to Deport You","author_text":"Sabrina Toppa","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Development Set","description":"When shop-owner Nazir Masih left Pakistan in the late 1970s to try his luck in the oil-rich city of Abu Dhabi, he did not imagine a future of detention and deportation.

Human rights activists believe the policy is detrimental to public health.\nWhen shop-owner Nazir Masih left Pakistan in the late 1970s to try his luck in the oil-rich city of Abu Dhabi, he did not imagine a future of detention and deportation. Like millions of South Asian laborers in the United Arab Emirates, Masih had a wife and children who depended on his single income to scrape by in Pakistan’s lagging economy.\nAfter Masih learned that he had contracted HIV during a medical screening for a visa renewal in 1990, the United Arab Emirates said it reserved the right to deport him. When Masih arrived home to Pakistan, he was greeted with a shock: his face and HIV status were circulating in the local media, dragging him into public notoriety. Labeled Pakistan’s “first” HIV patient, Masih endured immediate backlash and ostracism — the poster child of HIV/AIDS at a time when few understood the disease’s meaning or its method of transmission. His homecoming in Pakistan, normally marked by celebratory gift-giving and sumptuous feasts, was now marred by a scandal.\nUnder the laws of many GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries, contracting communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS or Hepatitis C is sufficient grounds for deportation — even if the individual possesses a valid work permit. For many migrants, this adds yet another threat to an already precarious work situation in which employers have undue control. The Gulf’s labor sponsorship program, known as kafala, has drawn the ire of human rights groups and has even prompted an investigation from the International Labor Organization. Countries like Qatar face allegations of “forced labor” for crimes ranging from wage theft to passport confiscation, and the UAE has likewise come under fire from reports that millions of its laborers are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse under the kafala system.\nGCC countries, for the most part, defend their strict health prerequisites on migrant laborers. “One of the requirements for the renewal of residency permits for non-Emiratis living in the UAE is being healthy, fit, and free of contagious diseases,” an official from the UAE government told me over email. “In case a worker is suffering from a contagious disease, including AIDS, he will not receive a certificate of medical fitness.”\nHuman rights groups, however, maintain that this policy is detrimental to public health and wider labor force productivity. “HIV-positive status is not a legitimate reason for denying someone access to a country or for deporting them,” said Diederik Lohman, Human Rights Watch’s interim health director. “A key concern would be their access to anti-retroviral and other appropriate medical treatment. While availability of such treatment has increased significantly in recent years, it is still not available everywhere and to everyone who needs it. Thus, deportation could put someone’s life at risk.”\nOf course, GCC countries are not alone in viewing migrant workers as a potential health threat. The United States only removed travel restrictions on HIV in January 2010. Previously, travelers with communicable diseases were required to obtain a waiver of admissibility to enter the country.\nWhile Gulf countries are not alone in treating communicable diseases as an international liability, they possess some of the most stringent regulations against migrant workers.\nThe United Arab Emirates, for example, requires that anyone applying to reside or work in the country must receive HIV screening, and bans tourists from carrying anti-retroviral drugs into the country. Likewise, foreign nationals in Saudi Arabia are required to take an HIV test upon entry. In neighboring Bahrain, a positive HIV/AIDS test results in immediate deportation. Moreover, HIV/AIDS is not the only disease that can cost a migrant worker his job; countries like the UAE require mandatory testing for diseases like tuberculosis, syphilis, and Hepatitis B and C. Food industry employees, salon workers, and domestic workers all submit compulsory pregnancy tests to ensure “fitness” to perform their work duties.\n“Everyone is scared and says ‘Are you going to report me if it is positive?’ and ‘Are they going to deport me if it is positive?,’” Dr. Rosalie Sant, a Dubai-based medical professional, told The National newspaper.\nWhether such scrutiny of migrant workers is warranted is debatable. In Pakistan, migrant workers are not the group at highest risk of contracting HIV/AIDS; the highest prevalence rates exist among sex workers, transgender individuals, and injection drug users. Regardless, they are seen as a population that plays a critical role in transmission. Nazir Masih’s status as the “first” HIV/AIDS patient in Pakistan is difficult to prove, but testifies to the notion that migrant workers are implicated in the transmission process. Often, migrants are seen as a “bridge group” transmitting HIV from one country to the next, engaging in high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, engagement with sex workers, and other forms of casual sexual contact. Although it is difficult to assess the degree to which migrant workers expose themselves to a higher risk of HIV while abroad, there is an perception of risky sexual behavior. Indeed, when workers repatriate to their home countries, the fear is high that they will spread the disease into the national population.\nBut by criminalizing HIV-positive status, many Gulf states reduce the likelihood that foreign workers will volunteer information about their health status, for fear of jeopardizing employment prospects.\nEmployers are legally required to terminate contracts of ill migrant workers, and healthcare providers may forward information to immigration officers who will mandate removal from the country. Such reticence often prolongs lack of treatment or even acknowledgment of the disease, which can produce poor health outcomes for the worker and unleash negative consequences for close family members.\nA 2010 People Living with HIV Stigma Index found that Pakistani patients faced discrimination in employment, religious practice, and family engagement. The same survey highlighted that a third of people interviewed were denied access to care in the last year, and another third were physically assaulted because of their HIV status.\nIndeed, it is also not uncommon to find health care professionals passing moral judgment about their patients. “Some of the doctors handling HIV patients wear masks and some have been noted to have made… statements like, ‘HIV is a punishment from God for sinners’ (gunahon ki saza),” declared one report submitted to Pakistan’s National AIDS Control Program looking at the treatment of HIV-positive individuals in the country.\nThere is one benefit, however: the GCC’s strict screening can mean that some workers confront the disease at an earlier stage. In 2004, Ghulam Abbas took a job as a mechanic in the UAE to improve his eligibility for marriage in Pakistan, where his scant earnings pushed wedlock out of sight. In the Middle East, his wages were 5,200 dirham (about $1,400) per month, and his largest expense was the 500 dirham (around $136) he paid for the rent he shared with three other Pakistani workers. Like millions of low-wage laborers toiling in the Gulf, the money he wasn’t saving for marriage went to his family back in Pakistan, which relied on his remittance paychecks to survive. But even after Abbas married in 2007 and fathered two children, he hungered to earn more money, and so returned to the UAE to continue collecting paychecks.\nBut this time, during a routine medical screening, the doctors detected Hepatitis C. “If they hear the medical is clear, OK, you get a visa,” he later said about the process. “If not, vaapas, you go back.” Abbas spent fifteen days in UAE immigration detention until he was deported back to Pakistan.\nAbbas’ deportation provided him a clear employment imperative to learn about his health status and obtain the medical care he needed. “If I wasn’t applying for a visa renewal, I never would have known [that I had Hepatitis],” he said. “I was weak and just kept popping [pain killers].”\nOf course, Abbas’ wages as a security guard in Pakistan are meager compared to his previous earnings in the UAE. And whether or not GCC states choose to remove their health restrictions, the reality is that workers in Abbas’ position will continue to be driven there to seek out better wages. Given that these countries have dragged their feet on even the basic reform of their labor laws, however, it seems likely that their health policies will remain yet another burden on the precarious migrants who sustain their economies.\nThe Development Set is made possible by funding from the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation.

News reports are now confirming that the president-elect is likely to nominate Andrew Puzder as labor secretary. Puzder is CEO of the parent company of fast-food giants Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. and is probably best known for steering those chains toward their increasingly outlandish, big-breasted, babelicious approach to selling outrageously oversize hamburgers.\nFor all the talk of Trump’s game-changing unpredictability, he’s sure proving to have a pattern. After all, he’s set to nominate a climate change denier to head the Environmental Protection Agency and an opponent of expanded health insurance coverage to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Thus, despite Trump’s supposed championing of the American working class, it comes as little surprise that he has tapped a staunch opponent of the Obama administration’s efforts to improve the lives of millions of underpaid workers to take charge of the Labor Department.\nSurely at the top of a Secretary Puzder’s agenda (if he’s confirmed by Congress) would be to abandon any effort to defend President Obama’s executive order to significantly expand the eligibility for overtime pay. The order, which would have doubled the annual salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 to determine who qualifies for overtime pay after working 40 hours a week, has been subject to a legal challenge by business groups and a coalition of conservative state attorneys general; it’s up to the Labor Department to defend the order in court. Fat chance of that with Puzder, the fast-food executive who has written scathing op-eds against the overtime rule, at the helm.\nTrump has flip-flopped on raising the federal minimum wage, pivoting from his position early in the primaries that wages in America are “too high” to what seemed like a halfhearted embrace of boosting the stagnant federal minimum wage to “at least $10.” Puzder has adamantly opposed any substantial minimum wage hike, calling instead for a paltry raise of less than $2 per hour. That’s far less than what many labor experts see as a livable wage, and as a tactic, it’s one that appears more designed to sap the momentum of groups such as Fight for $15 than to provide workers with a more equitable standard of living.\nWithin hours after the first reports appeared regarding Puzder’s likely nomination, the Fight for $15 released the following statement from two employees of Puzder’s restaurant chains: Rogelio Hernandez, a cook at a Carl’s Jr. in Santa Monica, California, and Lacretia Jones, a Hardee’s cashier in Richmond, Virginia.\n“Putting one of the worst fast-food CEOs in charge of national labor policy sends a signal to workers that the Trump years are going to be about low pay, wage theft, sexual harassment, and racial discrimination,” the statement reads. “Instead of taking on the rigged economy, it seems like Trump wants to rig it up even more. Puzder is paid more in one day than we each make in one year working at his restaurant chains, and that’s the way he wants to keep it. Puzder is against unions, calls the minimum wage and overtime ‘restrictions’ and employees ‘extra cost,’ and even said he wants to fire workers like us and replace us with machines that can’t take vacations or sue their employers when they break the law.”\nFuturistic visions of fast-food automation aside, Puzder would otherwise seem decidedly retrograde: He’s a 66-year-old white male multimillionaire whose veneration for a pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps American fairy tale has remained stubbornly impervious to the economic reality that upward mobility in the country is declining as surely as income inequality is skyrocketing. Yet he’s been as unapologetic in his embrace of rollicking, free-market, worker-trouncing capitalism as he has of his chains’ blatantly sexist “boobs and burgers” advertising. “I like our ads,” Puzder told Entrepreneur last year, “I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it’s very American. I used to hear, brands take on the personality of the CEO. And I rarely thought that was true, but I think this one, in this case, it kind of did take on my personality.”\nNo doubt that ethos, harking back to Trump’s own “locker room talk,” appealed to the president-elect in choosing Puzder for labor secretary—as did the fast-food CEO’s loyalty. As The Washington Post reported, Puzder and his wife contributed upwards of $332,000 to get Trump elected—about 15 times the average annual salary for fast-food workers in America."},{"url":"http://www.newsminer.com/news/alaska_news/walker-to-introduce-budget-compromise-negotiations-have-reached-a-stalemate/article_4910c9aa-47de-11e7-9b3e-ebe476c45185.html","title":"Walker to introduce budget compromise: 'Negotiations have reached a stalemate'","author_text":"Matt Buxton, mbuxton@newsminer.com","keywords":["Alaska News","Politics"],"publication_text":"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner","description":"FAIRBANKS - The Alaska Legislature has passed the halfway mark of its special session with nearly nothing to show for its work, and Gov.

Without the operating budget—an element that's usually negotiated last—in place by July 1, the state will have to shut down.\n\"A government shutdown is unacceptable, and compromise is essential,\" Walker said.\nWalker said he'll be introducing his own compromise pieced together from the scraps of the special session and presenting it to the Legislature next week.\n\"There is no reason lawmakers cannot complete their work within the current special session,\" he said. \"Alaskans deserve economic stability, and a fiscal solution that can withstand volatile oil prices and production. We must do all we can to remove the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over our state.”\nIn a statement on Thursday, Walker said cryptically that legislative leaders had requested an additional day before he would step in. The Senate used Friday to hold a technical floor session, the Republican-led Senate Majority scheduled a news confernece but canceled it after a 20-minute delay and the House used it to hold a floor session filled with special order speeches pointing blame at one another.\nContact staff writer Matt Buxton at 459-7544.

Magazine","description":"","date":"","full_text":"Somewhere in the bizarre first hour of the new Twin Peaks–you could be forgiven for losing track of time–this happens:\nA young man and woman (Ben Rosenfield, Madeline Zima) sit in a room staring at a large, empty glass cube. Nothing happens. They watch.\nCube. Couple. Nothing. Uncomfortably looooong takes. In most contemporary shows, cuts are rapid and cameras are usually in motion. Cube… couple… nothing.\nDirector and co-writer David Lynch didn’t care about our attention span, our expectations for the iconic show’s return.\nI turned to the friend I was watching it with and said, “Hey, I think that’s us.”\nDirector and co-writer David Lynch didn’t care about our attention span, our expectations for the iconic show’s return after more than a quarter-century, or anything but giving life to these unhinged ideas. Not a show that seems focus-grouped.\nThen something terrible happens to the two people watching the formerly empty cube. And that’s when I settled in for the ride. We were back in good hands. The new Twin Peaks isn’t so much comfort food as discomfort food, arriving at the perfect time–an uncompromising artistic nightmare amid a chaotic and cruel Dunning-Kruger effect nightmare in the real world. FBI Agent Dale Cooper’s world is a respite from FBI Director James Comey’s world. That is, ex-FBI director. That is, Donald Trump’s world. A respite in the Black Lodge from the White House.\nThere’s no way to quantify it, but the anticipation for The Return seemed like more than nostalgia or the desire to wrap up loose ends. (The original series ended with the jolting image of Kyle MacLachlan’s Cooper possessed by the killer BOB spirit.) Call it Cooper-esque intuition combined with a career of tracking pop culture, but this didn’t feel like a new season of The Walking Dead.\nSettling in for the ride: Stephen King and others have compared the horror genre to riding a carnival roller coaster. You get scares and catharsis, then you hop off the ride you knew was safe the whole time. We can’t do that with the ride Trump’s taking us on, and reports of Trump-related stress and anxiety are widespread. On Sam Harris’ Waking Up podcast, I just heard Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century author Timothy Snyder talk about a cancer patient who decided to stop treatments after Trump’s election, and died. That’s one way off that ride.\nSince a 2016 election surreal even by Lynch standards, we’ve been in uncharted terror-tory with a cartoonishly dishonest and ignorant carny who appealed to the worst in people, possessing about a fifth of the population like a BOB more into racism and misogyny than murder.\nRussia likely messed with our election, and President BOB’s campaign may have colluded with them.\nWe’ve been a presidential tweet or two away from nuclear war with North Korea.\nBoth the GOP budget and plan to replace Obamacare are unthinkably cruel efforts to perpetrate massive suffering and death to further line the pockets of the rich.\nAnd with actual scientists warning us that we’re at or near a catastrophic climate change tipping point, Trump and his nihilistic minions are just punching the gas pedal.\nSo you could also be forgiven for feeling a more powerful than normal surge of emotion at the opening twang of Angelo Badalamenti’s Twin Peaks theme. It signals escape from the world of a dangerous maniac to that of a relatively benign one.\nIn its 1990-1991 run on ABC, Twin Peaks broke new ground with its sinister, stylish paranormal soap opera in a small Washington town where high school homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) is found dead and wrapped in plastic. Cooper, a quirky, intuitive boy scout of a G-man with a black suit as immaculate as his slicked hair, arrives to work the case, becoming enamored of the local pie, coffee and oddball locals with unsavory secrets.\nA pop culture phenomenon, it ran out of steam after network bigwigs mandated Palmer’s murder solved, and got canceled. In the final episode, she tells Cooper, in the dream-dimension Black Lodge, “I’ll see you again in 25 years.”\nAnd here we are.\nThe third season is weirder, darker, more artsy. Showtime boss David Nevins called it “the pure heroin of David Lynch,” and forgot to mention the mushrooms. Lynch co-created and co-wrote Twin Peaks with Mark Frost and directed just a few original episodes. But he auteured the living garmonbozia out of all 18 new ones. You don’t need a blacklight to see his eccentric DNA everywhere. This is Twin Peaks by way of Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive (Lynch’s intended Peaks TV follow-up salvaged as a feature), as well as the messed-up prequel film, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. (Initially a bomb, it’s getting the re-evaluation it deserves.) All of which can be summed up by the image of Cooper’s body being extruded from an electrical outlet.\nWe’re faced with a new scandal, outrage, or terror from the President BOB administration each day.\nI’d have to be able to describe the plot to spoil it. But a semi-catatonic version of Cooper is trapped in the Black Lodge, while a long-haired doppelganger of him called “Mr. C” runs amok in the real world, and an overweight, gold-jacketed one named Dougie cavorts with a hooker. The dancing dwarf known as The Man from Another Place has been replaced by a talking tree with a brain on top. Add helpings of creamed corn soul vomit (see: “garmonbozia,” above).\nAnd then it starts getting strange. (See: “electrical outlet.”)\nLynch doesn’t indulge in much overt commentary. However, as hard-of-hearing Deputy Director Gordon Cole in the fourth episode, Lynch shouts at David Duchovny’s transgender FBI chief of staff Denise Bryson, “When you became Denise, I told all of your colleagues, those clown comics, to fix their hearts or die!” A cheer-out-loud moment, in light of the Republican brainpower expended on what bathrooms trans people should use.\nWe’re faced with a new scandal, outrage, or terror from the President BOB administration each day. He’s just returned from his International Embarrassment Tour of Europe and the Middle East, facing a widening Russia investigation, and tweeting about “negative press covfefe.” Oh, god, is that his garmonbozia?\nWith 14 episodes to go, the Black Lodge might feel more and more like a safe space."},{"url":"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/How-to-pronounce-Bay-Area-landmarks-streets-and-11154134.php","title":"You're saying it wrong!

But the fanfare was overshadowed by a concern that has been snowballing for months, filling many Kenyans with mild terror: How can the country repay its monstrous debt to China?\nChina’s Eximbank accounts for about 90 percent of the Nairobi-Mombasa project. The loan has already pushed the Kenyan debt above 50 percent of output, and imports of Chinese supplies and materials required to build the railway are making people anxious about Kenya’s worsening trade imbalance with China.\nThe Kenyan government says that the railway will increase gross domestic product by 1.5 percent, and that the loan will be paid back in about four years. The government is also aiming to run the trains on electricity.\nKen Mugane, a Nairobi businessman who went on a test ride a few days before it opened officially, said the train was impressive, echoing widespread opinion that it would improve trade and reduce congestion. The Express service cuts travel time by about half — to five hours from 10.\nBut very little of it conjured an image of Kenya, he said, except maybe for the landscape. “It needs to look like it’s ours,” he said. “After all, we’re going to pay for it through our noses, aren’t we?”\nSmall details seemed designed to remind Kenyans that the project wasn’t a free ride, he joked. Pamphlets were in Chinese. Some staff members wore uniforms of red and gold — the colors of China’s flag. Even the music on the train wasn’t Kenyan, he complained.\nThe biggest surprise, Mr. Mugane said, was seeing a sculpture of Mao Zedong at the Mombasa station. (It was actually of Zheng He, a 15th-century Chinese explorer who sailed to East Africa.) The man putting it on a plinth was Chinese, Mr. Mugane noted. “Even that wasn’t being done by a Kenyan,” he said ruefully.\nDespite such misgivings, Kenya wouldn’t have had its first new railway for more than a century – the last one was built by the British in 1901 – if it weren’t for Chinese loans and China’s strong record of getting projects built on time. It took less than four years for the line to be completed.\nChina’s state-run news media has celebrated its completion as demonstrating a Chinese commitment to African development.\nThe new Kenyan line “bears the Kenyan people’s dream for this century of striving for national development and prosperity,” a Chinese vice foreign minister, Zhang Ming, said in Nairobi this month. “This also shows China’s firm support for Kenya achieving independent and sustainable development.”\nBut on Kenyan television, reports about the railway’s opening invariably turned to its inflated cost, and to questions of corruption. On one show, a politician who had switched allegiances from the opposition to Mr. Kenyatta’s party and who extolled the railway’s virtues was quickly submerged by calls from viewers. “You are lying,” one person said. “You were bribed.”\nAs a result of the railway’s gargantuan cost, and the equally enormous task of repaying China, some Kenyans already have a nickname for it: the Lunatic Express 2.\nThe name Lunatic Express was coined more than a century ago to describe a colonial British railway so costly it was considered a “gigantic folly,” even by the standards of the Empire. The 660-mile line linked Lake Victoria with Mombasa. Thousands of laborers, most of them Indians, died from harsh working conditions, disease, hostile tribes and even man-eating lions.\nIn recent years, riding the train had become an act of lunacy itself. Passengers boarded a rusting, creaking millipede overtaken by trucks, buses and grazing animals that had claimed parts of the railway as resting spots.\nThe SGR, its Chinese successor, travels much faster, averaging 74 miles an hour, and is designed to carry 22 million tons of cargo a year. Its construction involved little foreign labor or murderous animals. The lunacy, many Kenyans say, is the idea of generations being chained to China, long after Mr. Kenyatta and his coterie leave office.\n“It’s madness,” said Samuel Nyandemo, a senior lecturer in economics at Nairobi University, who was visibly outraged. Why, he almost shouted, is the railway twice as expensive as a similar project in neighboring Ethiopia or Morocco? And why was the tendering process done behind closed doors, if not to allow Kenya’s political elite to pocket vast sums of kickbacks?\n“This is another type of lunacy,” he said.\nThere are parallels between the old Lunatic line and its replacement, said Elias Randiga, the assistant director of the Railway Museum in Nairobi, a stone’s throw from the original Nairobi Station.\nShabby and dilapidated, it had imposing lettering on one wall that read (as if to drive the point that lower classes weren’t welcome), “Upper Class Booking and Ticketing Office.”\nOpened in 1899, the building was constructed on marshland used by Maasai pastoralists to graze their cattle. The name Nairobi is derived from the Maasai word meaning “a place of cool waters.”\nToday, a cacophonous, chaotic city shoves itself onto the grounds of the prim Victorian station. “Matatu” buses unceremoniously dump off passengers, while businessmen in suits buy fruit from village women. A bright-red election bus spilling over with President Kenyatta’s supporters recently snarled traffic, as some hopped off and strutted to Kenyan pop music and the honking horns of irritated drivers.\nThe British railway, Mr. Randiga said, was built to extract and ship out natural resources from the African interior, something that many Westerners frequently accuse China of doing.\nThe Indian laborers working for the British faced a hostile environment, including the sheer physical challenge of laying down 17,000 miles of track that climbed into mountains and then descended into the Great Rift Valley.\nMore than 4,000 people died during the railway’s construction. Among them, dozens were killed and eaten by lions, including one British man who was dragged out of his bed by one. “Tsavo camp remained very much a man-eater’s chophouse,” wrote Charles Miller in “The Lunatic Express,” a book about the railway’s construction, referring to the region that became Tsavo National Park.\nLion attacks were so bad that Indian laborers went on strike, Mr. Randiga said. “There was a myth among Indians that they were targeted because they ate spice and lions liked spice,” he said, taking out a small plastic box from a drawer and presenting it. In it were century-old claws that belonged to one of the lions, yellowed and smooth like pieces of ivory. (“I keep them under lock and key,” he said.)\nThe Chinese railway has also not been without controversy. At least 10 elephants were killed during construction when they collided with trains, according to Save the Elephants, a nongovernmental group.\nJust as there has been local opposition to the Chinese-made railway over land issues, the British were attacked by a tribe led by a man who had prophesied that an “Iron Snake” would lure its people and colonize them.\n“Which turned out to be true,” said Mr. Randiga.\nHe proceeded to recite a poem by a British politician, Henry Labouchere, who opposed the railway’s construction back in the early 1900s. It says, in part:\nWhere it is going to, nobody knows.\nWhat is the use of it, none can conjecture.\nWhat it will carry there’s none can define.\nIt is clearly nought but a lunatic line.\nMr. Randiga paused, and laughed. “We have the same debate today.”"},{"url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/opinion/can-the-states-save-american-democracy.html?_r=0","title":"Opinion | Can the States Save American Democracy?","author_text":"Hedrick Smith","keywords":["Campaign Finance","Redistricting And Reapportionment","United States","Senate","House Of Representatives","Supreme Court (Us)","State Legislatures","Elections"],"publication_text":null,"description":"Across the country, state-level campaigns fight the influence of big money and gerrymandered congressional districts.","date":"2016-08-20","full_text":"WASHINGTON — In this tumultuous election year, little attention has focused on the groundswell of support for political reform across grass-roots America. Beyond Bernie Sanders’s call for a political revolution, a broad array of state-level citizen movements are pressing for reforms against Citizens United, gerrymandering and campaign megadonors to give average voters more voice, make elections more competitive, and ease gridlock in Congress.\nThis populist backlash is in reaction to two monumental developments in 2010: the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling authorizing unlimited corporate campaign donations, and a Republican strategy to rig congressional districts. Together, they have changed the dynamics of American politics.\nThat January, Justice John Paul Stevens warned in his dissent that Citizens United would “unleash the floodgates” of corporate money into political campaigns, and so it has. The overall funding flood this year is expected to surpass the record of $7 billion spent in 2012.\nLater in 2010, the Republican Party’s “Redmap” strategy won the party control of enough state governments to gerrymander congressional districts across the nation the following year. One result: In the 2014 elections, Republicans won 50.7 percent of the popular vote and reaped a 59-seat majority.\nNow, with Congress often gridlocked by Republicans from those safe districts, the initiative on reform has shifted to the states. Insurgency has spread beyond California and New York to unlikely Republican bastions like Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Nebraska and South Dakota.\nAt this point, 17 states have become reform battlegrounds. In six, lawsuits are challenging racial or partisan gerrymandering, and in five more, that goal is being pursued by popular movements, state governors or legislative bodies. This summer, federal courts have ruled in favor of suits seeking to strike down strict photo-identification requirements in Texas, North Carolina and North Dakota. The courts found that the requirements discriminated against minorities, and often seniors and students. Other citizen lawsuits have won restoration of early voting days in Ohio and straight-ticket voting for Michigan.\nSouth Dakota and Washington State are holding referendums on proposals for more transparent elections; similar petition drives fell just short of success in Arizona and Idaho. This year, reformers in California, New York and Washington State have been mustering votes to press Congress to control campaign funding and ban corporate campaign contributions.\nIn the pushback against Citizens United, 17 states and more than 680 local governments have appealed to Congress for a constitutional amendment, either through a letter to Congress, referendums, legislative resolutions, city council votes or collective letters from state lawmakers. In the most prominent case, California’s 18 million registered voters get to vote in November on whether to instruct their 55-member congressional delegation to “use all of their constitutional authority” to overturn Citizens United. Washington State is holding a similar referendum.\nIn 2014, a Democratic amendment proposal to allow regulation and limits on electoral spending won a 54-42 majority in the Senate, strictly along party lines, but fell short of the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster. Now bills calling for a 6-to-1 match of public funds for small campaign donations up to $150, or requiring disclosure of funders for campaign ads, have wide Democratic support, but are blocked by Republican opposition.\nYet out in the country, even in some reliably red states, reform movements have sprouted. South Dakota is one, thanks to three petition drives. One seeks to make primaries nonpartisan and another calls for an independent redistricting commission. A third is for a ballot measure, similar to one in Washington State, that would create a $50 tax credit for each voter to donate to a political candidate; ban campaign contributions exceeding $100 from lobbyists and state contractors; and mandate that independent groups speedily disclose the top five contributors to political ads and electioneering communications made within 60 days of an election.\nIn April, Nebraska’s Republican-dominated Legislature voted 29-15 to set up an independent redistricting commission. Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, vetoed the bill, but reformist legislators promise a revised proposal in the next session.\nGroups like Independentvoting.org, which has grass-roots organizations in 40 states, are mobilizing against the de facto disenfranchisement of independent voters (who now outnumber both Democrats and Republicans) through the gerrymandering of nearly 90 percent of the nation’s congressional districts into one-party monopolies. In states with closed primaries, this denies independents any vote in the primaries, which makes them favorable turf for extremist candidates in the only seriously contested voting.\nIn addition, nonpartisan local-election primaries, in which all voters can choose any candidate without regard for party, are being pushed by a citizens movement in South Dakota. Louisiana, California and Washington State already use them.\nTwo dozen states have attacked gerrymandering head-on. Eleven have set up independent redistricting commissions or other politically neutral mechanisms. Legal challenges have been mounted in half a dozen others. In seven more, including Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, popular movements, state legislatures and even the Republican governors Larry Hogan of Maryland, John Kasich of Ohio and Mike Pence of Indiana, who is now Donald J. Trump’s running mate, have said it’s time to outlaw gerrymandering.\nIn April, Governor Kasich won resounding applause from the Ohio Legislature when he called for an end to gerrymandering: “When pure politics is what drives these kinds of decisions, the result is polarization and division. I think we’ve had enough of that.”"},{"url":"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/12/532597956/art-collector-sells-lichtenstein-for-165-million-to-fund-criminal-justice-reform","title":"Art Collector Sells A Lichtenstein For $165 Million To Fund Criminal Justice Reform","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"NPR.org","description":"Agnes Gund sold Roy Lichtenstein's Masterpiece for an eye-popping sum to support the new Art For Justice Fund.

We’re sitting in a conference room at the San Marcos Treatment Center, just south of Austin, Texas, a space that has witnessed countless difficult conversations between troubled children, their worried parents, and clinical therapists. But today promises unalloyed joy. Samantha’s mother is visiting from Idaho, as she does every six weeks, which means lunch off campus and an excursion to Target. The girl needs supplies: new jeans, yoga pants, nail polish.\nListen to the audio version of this article:\nDownload the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles.\nAt 11, Samantha is just over 5 feet tall and has wavy black hair and a steady gaze. She flashes a smile when I ask about her favorite subject (history), and grimaces when I ask about her least favorite (math). She seems poised and cheerful, a normal preteen. But when we steer into uncomfortable territory—the events that led her to this juvenile-treatment facility nearly 2,000 miles from her family—Samantha hesitates and looks down at her hands. “I wanted the whole world to myself,” she says. “So I made a whole entire book about how to hurt people.”\nStarting at age 6, Samantha began drawing pictures of murder weapons: a knife, a bow and arrow, chemicals for poisoning, a plastic bag for suffocating. She tells me that she pretended to kill her stuffed animals.\n“You were practicing on your stuffed animals?,” I ask her.\nShe nods.\n“How did you feel when you were doing that to your stuffed animals?”\n“Happy.”\n“Why did it make you feel happy?”\n“Because I thought that someday I was going to end up doing it on somebody.”\n“Did you ever try?”\nSilence.\n“I choked my little brother.”\nSubscribe\nSamantha’s parents, Jen and Danny, adopted Samantha when she was 2. They already had three biological children, but they felt called to add Samantha (not her real name) and her half sister, who is two years older, to their family. They later had two more kids.\nFrom the start, Samantha seemed a willful child, in tyrannical need of attention. But what toddler isn’t? Her biological mother had been forced to give her up because she’d lost her job and home and couldn’t provide for her four children, but there was no evidence of abuse. According to documentation from the state of Texas, Samantha met all her cognitive, emotional, and physical milestones. She had no learning disabilities, no emotional scars, no signs of ADHD or autism.\nBut even at a very young age, Samantha had a mean streak. When she was about 20 months old, living with foster parents in Texas, she clashed with a boy in day care. The caretaker soothed them both; problem solved. Later that day Samantha, who was already potty trained, walked over to where the boy was playing, pulled down her pants, and peed on him. “She knew exactly what she was doing,” Jen says. “There was an ability to wait until an opportune moment to exact her revenge on someone.”\nWhen Samantha got a little older, she would pinch, trip, or push her siblings and smile if they cried. She would break into her sister’s piggy bank and rip up all the bills. Once, when Samantha was 5, Jen scolded her for being mean to one of her siblings. Samantha walked upstairs to her parents’ bathroom and washed her mother’s contact lenses down the drain. “Her behavior wasn’t impulsive,” Jen says. “It was very thoughtful, premeditated.”\nJen, a former elementary-school teacher, and Danny, a physician, realized they were out of their depth. They consulted doctors, psychiatrists, and therapists. But Samantha only grew more dangerous. They had her admitted to a psychiatric hospital three times before sending her to a residential treatment program in Montana at age 6. Samantha would grow out of it, one psychologist assured her parents; the problem was merely delayed empathy. Samantha was impulsive, another said, something that medication would fix. Yet another suggested that she had reactive attachment disorder, which could be ameliorated with intensive therapy. More darkly—and typically, in these sorts of cases—another psychologist blamed Jen and Danny, implying that Samantha was reacting to harsh and unloving parenting.\nOne bitter December day in 2011, Jen was driving the children along a winding road near their home. Samantha had just turned 6. Suddenly Jen heard screaming from the back seat, and when she looked in the mirror, she saw Samantha with her hands around the throat of her 2-year-old sister, who was trapped in her car seat. Jen separated them, and once they were home, she pulled Samantha aside.\n“What were you doing?,” Jen asked.\n“I was trying to choke her,” Samantha said.\n“You realize that would have killed her? She would not have been able to breathe. She would have died.”\n“I know.”\n“What about the rest of us?”\n“I want to kill all of you.”\nSamantha later showed Jen her sketches, and Jen watched in horror as her daughter demonstrated how to strangle or suffocate her stuffed animals. “I was so terrified,” Jen says. “I felt like I had lost control.”\nFour months later, Samantha tried to strangle her baby brother, who was just two months old.\nJen and Danny had to admit that nothing seemed to make a difference—not affection, not discipline, not therapy. “I was reading and reading and reading, trying to figure out what diagnosis made sense,” Jen tells me. “What fits with the behaviors I’m seeing?” Eventually she found one condition that did seem to fit—but it was a diagnosis that all the mental-health professionals had dismissed, because it’s considered both rare and untreatable. In July 2013, Jen took Samantha to see a psychiatrist in New York City, who confirmed her suspicion.\n“In the children’s mental-health world, it’s pretty much a terminal diagnosis, except your child’s not going to die,” Jen says. “It’s just that there’s no help.” She recalls walking out of the psychiatrist’s office on that warm afternoon and standing on a street corner in Manhattan as pedestrians pushed past her in a blur. A feeling flooded over her, singular, unexpected. Hope. Someone had finally acknowledged her family’s plight. Perhaps she and Danny could, against the odds, find a way to help their daughter.\nSamantha was diagnosed with conduct disorder with callous and unemotional traits. She had all the characteristics of a budding psychopath.\nPsychopaths have always been with us. Indeed, certain psychopathic traits have survived because they’re useful in small doses: the cool dispassion of a surgeon, the tunnel vision of an Olympic athlete, the ambitious narcissism of many a politician. But when these attributes exist in the wrong combination or in extreme forms, they can produce a dangerously antisocial individual, or even a cold-blooded killer. Only in the past quarter century have researchers zeroed in on the early signs that indicate a child could be the next Ted Bundy.\nResearchers shy away from calling children psychopaths; the term carries too much stigma, and too much determinism. They prefer to describe children like Samantha as having “callous and unemotional traits,” shorthand for a cluster of characteristics and behaviors, including a lack of empathy, remorse, or guilt; shallow emotions; aggression and even cruelty; and a seeming indifference to punishment. Callous and unemotional children have no trouble hurting others to get what they want. If they do seem caring or empathetic, they’re probably trying to manipulate you.\nResearchers believe that nearly 1 percent of children exhibit these traits, about as many as have autism or bipolar disorder. Until recently, the condition was seldom mentioned. Only in 2013 did the American Psychiatric Association include callous and unemotional traits in its diagnostic manual, DSM-5. The condition can go unnoticed because many children with these traits—who can be charming and smart enough to mimic social cues—are able to mask them.\nMore than 50 studies have found that kids with callous and unemotional traits are more likely than other kids (three times more likely, in one study) to become criminals or display aggressive, psychopathic traits later in life. And while adult psychopaths constitute only a tiny fraction of the general population, studies suggest that they commit half of all violent crimes. Ignore the problem, says Adrian Raine, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, “and it could be argued we have blood on our hands.”\nResearchers believe that two paths can lead to psychopathy: one dominated by nature, the other by nurture. For some children, their environment—growing up in poverty, living with abusive parents, fending for themselves in dangerous neighborhoods—can turn them violent and coldhearted. These kids aren’t born callous and unemotional; many experts suggest that if they’re given a reprieve from their environment, they can be pulled back from psychopathy’s edge.\n“I don’t know what you call this emotion,” one psychopathic prisoner said, looking at a photo of a fearful face, “but it’s what people look like just before you stab them.”\nBut other children display callous and unemotional traits even though they are raised by loving parents in safe neighborhoods. Large studies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have found that this early-onset condition is highly hereditary, hardwired in the brain—and especially difficult to treat. “We’d like to think a mother and father’s love can turn everything around,” Raine says. “But there are times where parents are doing the very best they can, but the kid—even from the get-go—is just a bad kid.”\nStill, researchers stress that a callous child—even one who was born that way—is not automatically destined for psychopathy. By some estimates, four out of five children with these traits do not grow up to be psychopaths. The mystery—the one everyone is trying to solve—is why some of these children develop into normal adults while others end up on death row.\nA trained eye can spot a callous and unemotional child by age 3 or 4. Whereas normally developing children at that age grow agitated when they see other children cry—and either try to comfort them or bolt the scene—these kids show a chilly detachment. In fact, psychologists may even be able to trace these traits back to infancy. Researchers at King’s College London tested more than 200 five-week-old babies, tracking whether they preferred looking at a person’s face or at a red ball. Those who favored the ball displayed more callous traits two and a half years later.\nAs a child gets older, more-obvious warning signs appear. Kent Kiehl, a psychologist at the University of New Mexico and the author of The Psychopath Whisperer, says that one scary harbinger occurs when a kid who is 8, 9, or 10 years old commits a transgression or a crime while alone, without the pressure of peers. This reflects an interior impulse toward harm. Criminal versatility—committing different types of crimes in different settings—can also hint at future psychopathy.\nBut the biggest red flag is early violence. “Most of the psychopaths I meet in prison had been in fights with teachers in elementary school or junior high,” Kiehl says. “When I’d interview them, I’d say, ‘What’s the worst thing you did in school?’ And they’d say, ‘I beat the teacher unconscious.’ You’re like, That really happened? It turns out that’s very common.”\nWe have a fairly good idea of what an adult psychopathic brain looks like, thanks in part to Kiehl’s work. He has scanned the brains of hundreds of inmates at maximum-security prisons and chronicled the neural differences between average violent convicts and psychopaths. Broadly speaking, Kiehl and others believe that the psychopathic brain has at least two neural abnormalities—and that these same differences likely also occur in the brains of callous children.\nThe first abnormality appears in the limbic system, the set of brain structures involved in, among other things, processing emotions. In a psychopath’s brain, this area contains less gray matter. “It’s like a weaker muscle,” Kiehl says. A psychopath may understand, intellectually, that what he is doing is wrong, but he doesn’t feel it. “Psychopaths know the words but not the music” is how Kiehl describes it. “They just don’t have the same circuitry.”\nIn particular, experts point to the amygdala—a part of the limbic system—as a physiological culprit for coldhearted or violent behavior. Someone with an undersize or underactive amygdala may not be able to feel empathy or refrain from violence. For example, many psychopathic adults and callous children do not recognize fear or distress in other people’s faces. Essi Viding, a professor of developmental psychopathology at University College London recalls showing one psychopathic prisoner a series of faces with different expressions. When the prisoner came to a fearful face, he said, “I don’t know what you call this emotion, but it’s what people look like just before you stab them.”\nWhy does this neural quirk matter? Abigail Marsh, a researcher at Georgetown University who has studied the brains of callous and unemotional children, says that distress cues, such as fearful or sad expressions, signal submission and conciliation. “They’re designed to prevent attacks by raising the white flag. And so if you’re not sensitive to these cues, you’re much more likely to attack somebody whom other people would refrain from attacking.”\nPsychopaths not only fail to recognize distress in others, they may not feel it themselves. The best physiological indicator of which young people will become violent criminals as adults is a low resting heart rate, says Adrian Raine of the University of Pennsylvania. Longitudinal studies that followed thousands of men in Sweden, the U.K., and Brazil all point to this biological anomaly. “We think that low heart rate reflects a lack of fear, and a lack of fear could predispose someone to committing fearless criminal-violence acts,” Raine says. Or perhaps there is an “optimal level of physiological arousal,” and psychopathic people seek out stimulation to increase their heart rate to normal. “For some kids, one way of getting this arousal jag in life is by shoplifting, or joining a gang, or robbing a store, or getting into a fight.” Indeed, when Daniel Waschbusch, a clinical psychologist at Penn State Hershey Medical Center, gave the most severely callous and unemotional children he worked with a stimulative medication, their behavior improved.\nThe second hallmark of a psychopathic brain is an overactive reward system especially primed for drugs, sex, or anything else that delivers a ping of excitement. In one study, children played a computer gambling game programmed to allow them to win early on and then slowly begin to lose. Most people will cut their losses at some point, Kent Kiehl notes, “whereas the psychopathic, callous unemotional kids keep going until they lose everything.” Their brakes don’t work, he says.\nFaulty brakes may help explain why psychopaths commit brutal crimes: Their brains ignore cues about danger or punishment. “There are all these decisions we make based on threat, or the fear that something bad can happen,” says Dustin Pardini, a clinical psychologist and an associate professor of criminology at Arizona State University. “If you have less concern about the negative consequences of your actions, then you’ll be more likely to continue engaging in these behaviors. And when you get caught, you’ll be less likely to learn from your mistakes.”\nResearchers see this insensitivity to punishment even in some toddlers. “These are the kids that are completely unperturbed by the fact that they’ve been put in time-out,” says Eva Kimonis, who works with callous children and their families at the University of New South Wales, in Australia. “So it’s not surprising that they keep going to time-out, because it’s not effective for them. Whereas reward—they’re very motivated by that.”\nThis insight is driving a new wave of treatment. What’s a clinician to do if the emotional, empathetic part of a child’s brain is broken but the reward part of the brain is humming along? “You co-opt the system,” Kiehl says. “You work with what’s left.”\nWith each passing year, both nature and nurture conspire to steer a callous child toward psychopathy and block his exits to a normal life. His brain becomes a little less malleable; his environment grows less forgiving as his exhausted parents reach their limits, and as teachers, social workers, and judges begin to turn away. By his teenage years, he may not be a lost cause, since the rational part of his brain is still under construction. But he can be one scary dude.\nLike the guy standing 20 feet away from me in the North Hall of Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center, in Madison, Wisconsin. The tall, lanky teenager has just emerged from his cell. Two staff members cuff his wrists, shackle his feet, and begin to lead him away. Suddenly he swivels to face me and laughs—a menacing laugh that gives me chills. As young men yell expletives, banging on the metal doors of their cells, and others stare silently through their narrow plexiglass windows, I think, This is as close as I get to Lord of the Flies.\nThe psychologists Michael Caldwell and Greg Van Rybroek thought much the same thing when they opened the Mendota facility in 1995, in response to a nationwide epidemic of youth violence in the early ’90s. Instead of placing young offenders in a juvenile prison until they were released to commit more—and more violent—crimes as adults, the Wisconsin legislature set up a new treatment center to try to break the cycle of pathology. Mendota would operate within the Department of Health Services, not the Department of Corrections. It would be run by psychologists and psychiatric-care technicians, not wardens and guards. It would employ one staff member for every three kids—quadruple the ratio at other juvenile-corrections facilities.\nCaldwell and Van Rybroek tell me that the state’s high-security juvenile-corrections facility was supposed to send over its most mentally ill boys between the ages of 12 and 17. It did, but what Caldwell and Van Rybroek didn’t anticipate was that the boys the facility transferred were also its most menacing and recalcitrant. They recall their first few assessments. “The kid would walk out and we would turn to each other and say, ‘That’s the most dangerous person I’ve ever seen in my life,’ ” Caldwell says. Each one seemed more threatening than the last. “We’re looking at each other and saying, ‘Oh, no. What have we done?,’ ” Van Rybroek adds.\nWhat they have done, by trial and error, is achieve something most people thought impossible: If they haven’t cured psychopathy, they’ve at least tamed it.\nMany of the teenagers at Mendota grew up on the streets, without parents, and were beaten up or sexually abused. Violence became a defense mechanism. Caldwell and Van Rybroek recall a group-therapy session a few years ago in which one boy described being strung up by his wrists and hung from the ceiling as his father cut him with a knife and rubbed pepper in the wounds. “Hey,” several other kids said, “that’s like what happened to me.” They called themselves the “piñata club.”\nBut not everyone at Mendota was “born in hell,” as Van Rybroek puts it. Some of the boys were raised in middle-class homes with parents whose major sin was not abuse but paralysis in the face of their terrifying child. No matter the history, one secret to diverting them from adult psychopathy is to wage an unrelenting war of presence. At Mendota, the staff calls this “decompression.” The idea is to allow a young man who has been living in a state of chaos to slowly rise to the surface and acclimate to the world without resorting to violence.\nCaldwell mentions that, two weeks ago, one patient became furious over some perceived slight or injustice; every time the techs checked on him, he would squirt urine or feces through the door. (This is a popular pastime at Mendota.) The techs would dodge it and return 20 minutes later, and he would do it again. “This went on for several days,” Caldwell says. “But part of the concept of decompression is that the kid’s going to get tired at some point. And one of those times you’re going to come there and he’s going to be tired, or he’s just not going to have any urine left to throw at you. And you’re going to have a little moment where you’re going to have a positive connection there.”\nCindy Ebsen, the operations director, who is also a registered nurse, gives me a tour of Mendota’s North Hall. As we pass the metal doors with their narrow windows, the boys peer out and the yelling subsides into entreaties. “Cindy, Cindy, can you get me some candy?” “I’m your favorite, aren’t I, Cindy?” “Cindy, why don’t you visit me anymore?”\nShe pauses to banter with each of them. The young men who pass through these halls have murdered and maimed, carjacked and robbed at gunpoint. “But they’re still kids. I love working with them, because I see the most success in this population,” as opposed to older offenders, Ebsen says. For many, friendship with her or another staff member is the first safe connection they’ve known.\nForming attachments with callous kids is important, but it’s not Mendota’s singular insight. The center’s real breakthrough involves deploying the anomalies of the psychopathic brain to one’s advantage—specifically, downplaying punishment and dangling rewards. These boys have been expelled from school, placed in group homes, arrested, and jailed. If punishment were going to rein them in, it would have by now. But their brains do respond, enthusiastically, to rewards. At Mendota, the boys can accumulate points to join ever more prestigious “clubs” (Club 19, Club 23, the VIP Club). As they ascend in status, they earn privileges and treats—candy bars, baseball cards, pizza on Saturdays, the chance to play Xbox or stay up late. Hitting someone, throwing urine, or cussing out the staff costs a boy points—but not for long, since callous and unemotional kids aren’t generally deterred by punishment.\nI am, frankly, skeptical—will a kid who knocked down an elderly lady and stole her Social Security check (as one Mendota resident did) really be motivated by the promise of Pokémon cards? But then I walk down the South Hall with Ebsen. She stops and turns toward a door on our left. “Hey,” she calls, “do I hear internet radio?”\n“Yeah, yeah, I’m in the VIP Club,” a voice says. “Can I show you my basketball cards?”\nEbsen unlocks the door to reveal a skinny 17-year-old boy with a nascent mustache. He fans out his collection. “This is, like, 50 basketball cards,” he says, and I can almost see his reward centers glowing. “I have the most and best basketball cards here.” Later, he sketches out his history for me: His stepmother had routinely beat him and his stepbrother had used him for sex. When he was still a preteen, he began molesting the younger girl and boy next door. The abuse continued for a few years, until the boy told his mother. “I knew it was wrong, but I didn’t care,” he says. “I just wanted the pleasure.”\nAt Mendota, he has begun to see that short-term pleasure could land him in prison as a sex offender, while deferred gratification can confer more-lasting dividends: a family, a job, and most of all, freedom. Unlikely as it sounds, this revelation sprang from his ardent pursuit of basketball cards.\nAfter he details the center’s point system (a higher math that I cannot follow), the boy tells me that a similar approach should translate into success in the outside world—as if the world, too, operates on a point system. Just as consistent good behavior confers basketball cards and internet radio inside these walls, so—he believes—will it bring promotions at work. “Say you’re a cook; you can [become] a waitress if you’re doing really good,” he says. “That’s the way I look at it.”\nHe peers at me, as if searching for confirmation. I nod, hoping that the world will work this way for him. Even more, I hope his insight will endure.\nIn fact, the program at Mendota has changed the trajectory for many young men, at least in the short term. Caldwell and Van Rybroek have tracked the public records of 248 juvenile delinquents after their release. One hundred forty-seven of them had been in a juvenile-corrections facility, and 101 of them—the harder, more psychopathic cases—had received treatment at Mendota. In the four and a half years since their release, the Mendota boys have been far less likely to reoffend (64 percent versus 97 percent), and far less likely to commit a violent crime (36 percent versus 60 percent). Most striking, the ordinary delinquents have killed 16 people since their release. The boys from Mendota? Not one.\n“We thought that as soon as they walked out the door, they’d last maybe a week or two and they’d have another felony on their record,” Caldwell says. “And when the data first came back that showed that that wasn’t happening, we figured there was something wrong with the data.” For two years, they tried to find mistakes or alternative explanations, but eventually they concluded that the results were real.\nThe question they are trying to answer now is this: Can Mendota’s treatment program not only change the behavior of these teens, but measurably reshape their brains as well? Researchers are optimistic, in part because the decision-making part of the brain continues to evolve into one’s mid‑20s. The program is like neural weight lifting, Kent Kiehl, at the University of New Mexico, says. “If you exercise this limbic-related circuitry, it’s going to get better.”\nTo test this hypothesis, Kiehl and the staff at Mendota are now asking some 300 young men to slide into a mobile brain scanner. The scanner records the shape and size of key areas of the boys’ brains, as well as how their brains react to tests of decision-making ability, impulsivity, and other qualities that go to the core of psychopathy. Each boy’s brain will be scanned before, during, and at the end of their time in the program, offering researchers insights into whether his improved behavior reflects better functioning inside his brain.\nNo one believes that Mendota graduates will develop true empathy or a heartfelt moral conscience. “They may not go from the Joker in The Dark Knight to Mister Rogers,” Caldwell tells me, laughing. But they can develop a cognitive moral conscience, an intellectual awareness that life will be more rewarding if they play by the rules. “We’re just happy if they stay on this side of the law,” Van Rybroek says. “In our world, that’s huge.”\nHow many can stay the course for a lifetime? Caldwell and Van Rybroek have no idea. They’re barred from contacting former patients—a policy meant to ensure that the staff and former patients maintain appropriate boundaries. But sometimes graduates write or call to share their progress, and among these correspondents, Carl, now 37, stands out.\nCarl (not his real name) emailed a thankful note to Van Rybroek in 2013. Aside from one assault conviction after he left Mendota, he had stayed out of trouble for a decade and opened his own business—a funeral home near Los Angeles. His success was especially significant because he was one of the harder cases, a boy from a good home who seemed wired for violence.\n“I remember when I bit my mom really hard, and she was bleeding and crying,” Carl says. “I remember feeling so happy, so overjoyed.”\nCarl was born in a small town in Wisconsin. The middle child of a computer programmer and a special-education teacher, “he came out angry,” his father recalls during a phone conversation. His acts of violence started small—hitting a classmate in kindergarten—but quickly escalated: ripping the head off his favorite teddy bear, slashing the tires on the family car, starting fires, killing his sister’s hamster.\nHis sister remembers Carl, when he was about 8, swinging their cat in circles by its tail, faster and faster, and then letting go. “And you hear her hit the wall.” Carl just laughed.\nLooking back, even Carl is puzzled by the rage that coursed through him as a child. “I remember when I bit my mom really hard, and she was bleeding and crying. I remember feeling so happy, so overjoyed—completely fulfilled and satisfied,” he tells me on the phone. “It wasn’t like someone kicked me in the face and I was trying to get him back. It was more like a weird, hard-to-explain feeling of hatred.”\nHis behavior confused and eventually terrified his parents. “It just got worse and worse as he got bigger,” his father tells me. “Later, when he was a teenager and occasionally incarcerated, I was happy about it. We knew where he was and that he’d be safe, and that took a load off the mind.”\nBy the time Carl arrived at Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center in November 1995, at age 15, he had been placed in a psychiatric hospital, a group home, foster care, or a juvenile-corrections center about a dozen times. His police record listed 18 charges, including armed burglary and three “crimes against persons,” one of which sent the victim to the hospital. Lincoln Hills, a high-security juvenile-corrections facility, foisted him on Mendota after he accumulated more than 100 serious infractions in less than four months. On an assessment called the Youth Psychopathy Checklist, he scored 38 out of a possible 40—five points higher than the average for Mendota boys, who were among the most dangerous young men in Wisconsin.\nCarl had a rocky start at Mendota: weeks of abusing staff, smearing feces around his cell, yelling all night, refusing to shower, and spending much of the time locked in his room, not allowed to mix with the other kids. Slowly, though, his psychology began to shift. The staff’s unruffled constancy chipped away at his defenses. “These people were like zombies,” Carl recalls, laughing. “You could punch them in the face and they wouldn’t do anything.”\nHe started talking in therapy and in class. He quit mouthing off and settled down. He developed the first real bonds in his young life. “The teachers, the nurses, the staff, they all seemed to have this idea that they could make a difference in us,” he says. “Like, Huh! Something good could come of us. We were believed to have potential.”\nCarl wasn’t exactly in the clear. After two stints at Mendota, he was released just before his 18th birthday, got married, and at age 20 was arrested for beating up a police officer. In prison, he wrote a suicide note, fashioned a makeshift noose, and was put on suicide watch in solitary confinement. While there, he began reading the Bible and fasting, and one day, he says, “something very powerful shifted.” He began to believe in God. Carl acknowledges that his lifestyle falls far short of the Christian ideal. But he still attends church every week, and he credits Mendota with paving the way for his conversion. By the time he was released, in 2003, his marriage had dissolved, and he moved away from Wisconsin, eventually settling in California, where he opened his funeral home.\nCarl cheerfully admits that the death business appeals to him. As a child, he says, “I had a deep fascination with knives and cutting and killing, so it’s a harmless way to express some level of what you might call morbid curiosity. And I think that morbid curiosity taken to its extreme—that’s the home of the serial killers, okay? So it’s that same energy. But everything in moderation.”\nOf course, his profession also requires empathy. Carl says that he had to train himself to show empathy for his grieving clients, but that it now comes naturally. His sister agrees that he’s been able to make this emotional leap. “I’ve seen him interact with the families, and he’s phenomenal,” she tells me. “He is amazing at providing empathy and providing that shoulder for them. And it does not fit with my view of him at all. I get confused. Is that true? Does he genuinely feel for them? Is he faking the whole thing? Does he even know at this point?”\nAfter talking with Carl, I begin to see him as a remarkable success story. “Without [Mendota] and Jesus,” he tells me, “I would have been a Manson-, Bundy-, Dahmer-, or Berkowitz-type of criminal.” Sure, his fascination with the morbid is a little creepy. Yet here he is, now remarried, the father of a 1-year-old son he adores, with a flourishing business. After our phone interview, I decide to meet him in person. I want to witness his redemption for myself.\nThe night before I’m scheduled to fly to Los Angeles, I receive a frantic email from Carl’s wife. Carl is in police custody. His wife tells me that Carl considers himself polyamorous, and had invited one of his girlfriends over to their apartment. (This woman denies ever being romantically involved with Carl.)* They were playing with the baby when his wife returned. She was furious, and grabbed their son. Carl responded by pulling her hair, snatching the baby out of her arms, and taking her phone to prevent her from calling the police. She called from a neighbor’s house instead. (Carl says he grabbed the baby to protect him.) Three misdemeanor charges—spousal battery, abandonment and neglect of a child, and intimidation of a witness—and the psychopath who made good is now in jail.\nI go to Los Angeles anyway, in the naive hope that Carl will be released on bail at his hearing the next day. A few minutes before 8:30 a.m., his wife and I meet at the courthouse and begin the long wait. She is 12 years Carl’s junior, a compact woman with long black hair and a weariness that ebbs only when she gazes at her son. She met Carl on OkCupid two years ago while visiting L.A. and—after a romance of just a few months—moved to California to marry him. Now she sits outside the courtroom, one eye on her son, fielding calls from clients of the funeral home and wondering whether she can make bail.\n“I’m so sick of the drama,” she says, as the phone rings again.\nCarl is a tough man to be married to. His wife says he’s funny and charming and a good listener, but he sometimes loses interest in the funeral business, leaving most of the work to her. He brings other women home for sex, even when she’s there. And while he’s never seriously beaten her up, he has slapped her.\n“He would say sorry, but I don’t know if he was upset or not,” she tells me.\n“So you wondered if he felt genuine remorse?”\n“Honestly, I’m at a point where I don’t really care anymore. I just want my son and myself to be safe.”\nFinally, at 3:15 p.m., Carl shuffles into the courtroom, handcuffed, wearing an orange L.A. County jumpsuit. He gives us a two-handed wave and flashes a carefree smile, which fades when he learns that he will not be released on bail today, despite pleading guilty to assault and battery. He will remain in jail for another three weeks.\nCarl calls me the day after his release. “I really shouldn’t have a girlfriend and a wife,” he says, in what seems an uncharacteristic display of remorse. He insists that he wants to keep his family together, and says that he thinks the domestic-violence classes the court has mandated will help him. He seems sincere.\nWhen I describe the latest twist in Carl’s story to Michael Caldwell and Greg Van Rybroek, they laugh knowingly. “This counts as a good outcome for a Mendota guy,” Caldwell says. “He’s not going to have a fully healthy adjustment to life, but he’s been able to stay mostly within the law. Even this misdemeanor—he’s not committing armed robberies or shooting people.”\nHis sister sees her brother’s outcome in a similar light. “This guy got dealt a shittier hand of cards than anybody I’ve ever met,” she tells me . “Who deserves to have started out life that way? And the fact that he’s not a raving lunatic, locked up for the rest of his life, or dead is insane. ”\nI ask Carl whether it’s difficult to play by the rules, to simply be normal. “On a scale of 1 to 10, how hard is it?” he says. “I would say an 8. Because 8’s difficult, very difficult.”\nI’ve grown to like Carl: He has a lively intellect, a willingness to admit his flaws, and a desire to be good. Is he being sincere or manipulating me? Is Carl proof that psychopathy can be tamed—or proof that the traits are so deeply embedded that they can never be dislodged? I honestly don’t know.\nAt the San Marcos Treatment Center, Samantha is wearing her new yoga pants from Target, but they bring her little joy. In a few hours, her mother will leave for the airport and fly back to Idaho. Samantha munches on a slice of pizza and suggests movies to watch on Jen’s laptop. She seems sad, but less about Jen’s departure than about the resumption of the center’s tedious routine. Samantha snuggles with her mom while they watch The BFG, this 11-year-old girl who can stab a teacher’s hand with a pencil at the slightest provocation.\nWatching them in the darkened room, I contemplate for the hundredth time the arbitrary nature of good and evil. If Samantha’s brain is wired for callousness, if she fails to experience empathy or remorse because she lacks the neural equipment, can we say she is evil? “These kids can’t help it,” Adrian Raine says. “Kids don’t grow up wanting to be psychopaths or serial killers. They grow up wanting to become baseball players or great football stars. It’s not a choice.”\nSamantha knows that her thoughts about hurting people are wrong, and she tries to suppress them. But the cognitive training cannot always compete.\nYet, Raine says, even if we don’t label them evil, we must try to head off their evil acts. It’s a daily struggle, planting the seeds of emotions that usually come so naturally—empathy, caring, remorse—in the rocky soil of a callous brain. Samantha has lived for more than two years at San Marcos, where the staff has tried to shape her behavior with regular therapy and a program that, like Mendota’s, dispenses quick but limited punishment for bad behavior and offers prizes and privileges—candy, Pokémon cards, late nights on weekends—for good behavior.\nJen and Danny have spotted green shoots of empathy. Samantha has made a friend, and recently comforted the girl after her social worker quit. They’ve detected traces of self-awareness and even remorse: Samantha knows that her thoughts about hurting people are wrong, and she tries to suppress them. But the cognitive training cannot always compete with the urge to strangle an annoying classmate, which she tried to do just the other day. “It builds up, and then I have to do it,” Samantha explains. “I can’t keep it away.”\nIt all feels exhausting, for Samantha and for everyone in her orbit. Later, I ask Jen whether Samantha has lovable qualities that make all this worthwhile. “It can’t be all nightmare, can it?,” I ask. She hesitates. “Or can it?”\n“It is not all nightmare,” Jen responds, eventually. “She’s cute, and she can be fun, and she can be enjoyable.” She’s great at board games, she has a wonderful imagination, and now, having been apart for two years, her siblings say they miss her. But Samantha’s mood and behavior can quickly turn. “The challenge with her is that her extreme is so extreme. You’re always waiting for the other shoe to drop.”\nDanny says they’re praying for the triumph of self-interest over impulse. “Our hope is that she is able to have a cognitive understanding that ‘Even though my thinking is different, my behavior needs to walk down this path so that I can enjoy the good things that I want.’ ” Because she was diagnosed relatively early, they hope that Samantha’s young, still-developing brain can be rewired for some measure of cognitive morality. And having parents like Jen and Danny could make a difference; research suggests that warm and responsive parenting can help children become less callous as they get older.\nOn the flip side, the New York psychiatrist told them, the fact that her symptoms appeared so early, and so dramatically, may indicate that her callousness is so deeply ingrained that little can be done to ameliorate it.\nSamantha’s parents try not to second-guess their decision to adopt her. But even Samantha has wondered whether they have regrets. “She said, ‘Why did you even want me?,’ ” Jen recalls. “The real answer to that is: We didn’t know the depth of her challenges. We had no idea. I don’t know if this would be a different story if we were looking at this now. But what we tell her is: ‘You were ours.’ ”\nJen and Danny are planning to bring Samantha home this summer, a prospect the family views with some trepidation. They’re taking precautions, such as using alarms on Samantha’s bedroom door. The older children are larger and tougher than Samantha, but the family will have to keep vigil over the 5-year-old and the 7-year-old. Still, they believe she’s ready, or, more accurately, that she’s progressed as far as she can at San Marcos. They want to bring her home, to give it another try.\nOf course, even if Samantha can slip easily back into home life at 11, what of the future? “Do I want that child to have a driver’s license?,” Jen asks. To go on dates? She’s smart enough for college—but will she be able to negotiate that complex society without becoming a threat? Can she have a stable romantic relationship, much less fall in love and marry? She and Danny have had to redefine success for Samantha: simply keeping her out of prison.\nAnd yet, they love Samantha. “She’s ours, and we want to raise our children together,” Jen says. Samantha has been in residential treatment programs for most of the past five years, nearly half her life. They can’t institutionalize her forever. She needs to learn to function in the world, sooner rather than later. “I do feel there’s hope,” Jen says. “The hard part is, it’s never going to go away. It’s high-stakes parenting. If it fails, it’s going to fail big.”\n* This article has been updated to clarify the relationship between Carl and the woman who visited his apartment.\nListen to an interview with the author, Barbara Bradley Hagerty:"},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-05-18/how-immigration-detention-creates-shadow-prison-system","title":"How immigration detention creates a shadow prison system","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Public Radio International","description":"Today, the practice of apprehending immigrants and holding them in custody has created a shadow prison system, complete with hundreds of federal and private facilities throughout the country.","date":"","full_text":"USA-IMMIGRATION-DETENTION.jpg\nFor much of the 20th century, immigration detention was a concept that was scoffed at. But today, the practice of apprehending immigrants and holding them in custody has created a shadow prison system, served by hundreds of federal and private facilities throughout the country.\nRalph Alhassani is a member of the LGBT community from Ghana — he felt persecuted there and sought asylum in the US in September 2015. He entered from Mexico and quickly apprehended by ICE. He was initially held in California for eight months and has been held in New Jersey for the last nine months.\n“Unfortunately for me, I didn't have an attorney to represent me before the judge,” he says. “Most of us who are not able to hire an attorney have to represent ourselves before the judge. When I was released, I was released on bond. I was released on a bond of $35,000 from the judge. Properties had to be sold to pay this bond for me. My mom did all this — she sold her house because she feared if I came back home, I'd be persecuted.\"\nAfter he was released in California, he was instructed to report to ICE regularly. Alhassani moved east, and in the summer of 2016, an officer decided that he should have never been released.\n“I was given a form to always report to ICE, and I did report all the time,” he says. “But then I met an ICE official, whom I explained my situation to — he was wondering how I was released, but [still] had to report all the time. So, I told him I was given a bond of $35,000 by a judge. So, he was like, ‘No it's not supposed to be that way.’ He asked me to come back in January 2017. But on the August 12, 2016, ICE said they wanted to see me on August 15. So, on the 15 when I went, they said they were going to cancel the bond because my case was not appealed.\"\nSince then, Alhassani has been in detention in New Jersey.\n“I don't really know what is happening,” he says from a scratchy phone line inside the detention center. Like other inmates, Alhassani is not allowed to receive calls. He can dial out at certain designated times that come with strict time limits, often at a very high price per minute.\n“All I know is ICE is trying to deport me right now because, on February 10, they made me speak to my consulate about my travel documents. I'm not having the money back, and now ICE is trying to deport me back to my country to face persecution,\" he says.\nNowadays, his hope and patience are running out.\n“It is hell. It is hell, my brother,” he says as an automated recording from the prison cuts between his words. “We've been treated like prisoners. There is no life here. There is no life.”\nHe later continues: “You have to be locked up during count, you have to be locked up when you're about to eat, and you have to be locked up when you're going to sleep. I want people to know that immigration detention is not a good thing at all. ICE is not treating us with justice. Because if I was allowed to pay bond and then come out of detention, why should I be detained again? Why should I be detained? I know United States believes in justice, the whole world — everybody knows that. And then after coming all the way from my country to this country to have my freedom, I’ve been treated like this. I don't think this is fair. So, if there's anything people could do to help people like me. … I would be most grateful. And that is my message.\"\nAlhassani has committed no crime.\nYanet Candelario Salazar is a 39-year-old with dual Canadian Cuban citizenship. She was stopped by ICE and was initially held at the Elizabeth Detention Center in New Jersey, which is now part of the Orange County Correctional Facility in New York, where she is with a mixed inmate population, even though she has a green card pending and has committed no crime.\n“I am in a dorm with about 50 beds, about half of the inmates here are people with criminal convictions or waiting to be convicted,” she says from inside the detention center. “I have adjusted to the lack of any freedom. The human rights abuses that I've seen there are unbelievable. The things that I've seen in here, I mean, I was in detention with a woman who was 83 years old and very frail, detained for like three weeks.”\nCandelario Salazar came to the United States three years ago. She was fleeing an abusive relationship in Canada and wanted to be close to her son and her sister, both of whom live in the US.\n“I mean, I am a regular citizen,” she says. “I used to do volunteer work. I don't break laws. I couldn't begin to imagine this, and even when I got here, I thought this was a mistake and they were going to release me shortly. It is unbelievable. I still cannot believe that I said I'd be here for a few weeks or a month, and I have lost any money that I have … I mean, the weight of my child, his grades have suffered and he's been on his own this whole time.\n“It was devastating to listen to that call knowing that she is in distress not having her son by her side,” says Sally Pillay, the director of First Friends, an immigration advocacy group that has set up a free hotline for people in immigration detention to call and seek support.\nShe is keenly aware of the challenges faced by people like Alhassani and Candelario Salazar.\n“We get different stories from different days, sometimes it’s heart-tugging and I have tears in my eyes with some of the stories that individuals will share with us,” Pillay says. “In particular, recently, we’ve been getting a lot of calls about how people are being picked up in communities, apprehended, especially when they go to ICE reportings, to ICE check-ins, and then are being re-detained. Or they are just being picked up on random traffic violations, where ICE is present at courts.”\nShe later adds: “We need policies and reforms that are just and humane.

A trained counselor at Gabe P. Allen Charter School in Dallas is typically available to help her son cope when an issue arises.\nThat counselor, Obis said, was not available on May 9, when her son was removed from class after he allegedly banged his head against a wall. Instead, officers with the Dallas Independent School District Police Department allegedly subdued the boy.\nObis told Dallas-Fort Worth’s NBC 5 News that when school officials notified her that there was an issue, she went directly to the school to pick her son up. but he was not there.\n“When I got there, [I said] ‘Where’s my baby?’” Obis told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth. “[The school said], ‘Oh, he’s not here. He was acting out ... so he’s gone.’”\nThe child was allegedly transported by police to Dallas Behavioral Healthcare in DeSoto, where Obis says a family member took a photo of the handcuffed child.\nThe Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.\nAccording to Fox 4 News, the boy was held at the facility until Monday, May 15, when staff determined he no longer posed a threat to himself.\nObis’ attorney, Amar Dhillon, did not return a request for comment from HuffPost on Tuesday. In an interview with CBS Dallas-Fort Worth, he made several serious allegations against the police department, claiming the child has injuries consistent with those left by a stun gun and a baton.\n“He did vividly describe being shocked and his body convulsing, and he was very clear about that,” Dhillon said.\nIt’s unclear if the child will return to the school. The school district has said privacy concerns prevent them from speaking specifically about the allegations. However, Fox 4 News did obtain a copy a statement the district sent out to parents after a photo of the handcuffed child began making the rounds on social media.\n“The image you may have seen posted is of a student while he is being restrained to protect himself against any further harm,” the statement said. “We ask for your help during this period to not continue to spread misinformation.”\nObis told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth she blames the incident on a “failure in training.”\n“He was denied his safe place,” Odis said. “I feel cheated and my son feels cheated.”"},{"url":"http://www.startribune.com/try-single-payer-conservative-style-for-a-bold-health-care-fix/426601181","title":"Try single-payer, conservative-style, for a bold health care fix","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Star Tribune","description":"A simple government safety net for catastrophic illness would score Trump major economic, political points.","date":"","full_text":"The prospects for repealing and replacing Obamacare are fading rapidly. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., sensing inevitable failure in the Senate, is already shifting the endeavor to the back burner. The time has come for the Trump administration to make a bold proposal, circumventing the deadlock and shattering conventional wisdom.\nPresident Trump should embrace a new, genuinely conservative version of the single-payer system used throughout the developed world. In the process, by building a new coalition of social conservatives and economic populists, Trump could permanently reshape the political landscape.\nThe current strategy of Ryancare was doomed from the start. It required the successful threading of a needle from a distance of a thousand yards. Given the razor-thin margins of Republican majorities in both houses, the 60-vote cloture obstacle in the Senate, and the Byzantine restrictions on the “reconciliation” gambit for relying on 50 senators and the vice president, and given that no complicated, Rube Goldberg-like contraption will ever be able to satisfy both the libertarian Freedom Caucus in the House and Republican moderates in the Senate, no plan devised by conventional “conservatives” has any hope of passage.\nYou cannot simultaneously provide cheap coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, move toward a free market and reduce federal spending. A prudent politician does not attempt the impossible.\nWe already spend more of the taxpayers’ dollars per citizen on our failed health care system than every country with a single-payer system (with the sole exception of Norway). Let that fact soak in: We could provide every citizen with coverage as good as anything available in Canada or Australia and still reduce government health care spending. In fact, by simultaneously eliminating the huge tax advantages given to health care, we could lower marginal taxes and balance the budget.\nHow is such a magical solution possible? Because we now have the worst possible system of all — one in which massive federal spending drives up medical costs, while the lack of an elegant, single-payer system deprives tens of millions of the security of coverage and foists the huge burden of costly private insurance on our businesses and industries.\nWith a single-payer system, the government could use its overwhelming position as the dominant buyer of health care to reduce costs dramatically, bringing both industry profits and physician and executive salaries back to sensible and sustainable levels.\nDoes this mean that Trump should endorse a Bernie Sanders-like single-payer system, similar to what has been proposed in California? Absolutely not.\nTrump should propose a “conservative” version, one that offers protection only for catastrophic illnesses, whether new or pre-existing. The system should have a large, income-adjusted deductible (10 percent of adjusted gross income), and it should pay only for essential care — care that significantly extends life or sensory or skeletal-muscular functioning.\nTrumpcare should explicitly exclude all social engineering disguised as “health” care, including abortion, contraception and “gender-reassignment” surgery.\nThis would accomplish two things: It would keep Trumpcare cost-effective (at levels no greater than current government spending, including lost tax revenue), and it would attract firm and enthusiastic support from America’s religious groups, especially Catholics and evangelicals.\nFinally, Trumpcare should respect the freedom of the individual states to add to the bare-bones coverage as they see fit, with an expected two-thirds federal and one-third state balance (as in Australia).\nThe proposal would be incredibly simple, with almost no administrative overhead. It would provide a true safety net for all Americans, thereby pre-empting any Democratic campaign toward socialized medicine. By using the new bargaining power of the government as dominant consumer, Republicans could finally bring health care costs under control, from 16 percent of GDP to something like 10 percent, ending the long-term Medicare-Medicaid fiscal crisis.\nTrump could use his proposal to divide the Democrats in Congress, forcing them to choose between one of their highest and longest-held goals (guaranteed health care for all) and their allegiance to the “transgressive” agenda of abortionists, transsexualists and zero-population-growth fanatics. Even if the proposal fails, it will give Trumpian reformists a positive and popular platform to run on in 2018, in both the Republican primaries and the general election for House and Senate seats.\nTrump cannot afford to outsource his agenda to the conventional GOP leadership of the House or the Senate. He must, like Benjamin Disraeli, the great British conservative prime minister of the 19th century, make his own mark, expanding the welfare state in a way that enhances conservative social goals while securing the political support of the working class for another generation or two.\nTrumpcare would be the greatest pro-life victory in our history. It would also marginalize the libertarian wing of the GOP, including Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, and the Freedom Caucus, giving Trump the advantage of governing from a broad center instead of a razor-thin, fractious coalition on the right.\nRobert C.

Worldwide, use of capital punishment dropped by 37 percent.","date":"2017-04-12","full_text":"—Capital punishment fell by more than one-third around the world last year – and the United States dropped out of the top 5 countries for the first time in a decade.\nThat was the finding of Amnesty International's annual report on the world's death sentences and executions in 2016. Compared with 2015, the human rights group found that capital punishment had decreased by 37 percent. In the US, the number of people executed – 20 – fell to levels not seen since 1991. The drop marks the first time since 2006 that the US has not been in the top five.\nOver the past few decades, the international view of capital punishment has shifted considerably, with more than two thirds of all nations no longer supporting the death penalty, either legally or in practice. But some countries, particularly China, Iran, and the US, maintain the practice as a legal mode of punishment.\nThe debate surrounding the death penalty in the US is a contentious one. Last fall, for instance, voters in California, Nebraska, and Oklahoma decided to keep the penalty legal in their respective states, despite overall support for the death penalty reaching lows not seen since it was reinstated in the 1970s. But that ambivalence might not remain for much longer, according to Robert Owen, a law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.\n\"The continuing decline in executions in the United States results from a combination of factors,\" he tells the Monitor via email. \"For example, innocent people continue to be identified and released from death row, which understandably undermines support for capital punishment. Also, historic concerns about racial injustice in the administration of the death penalty are once again receiving attention with the rise of activist movements such as Black Lives Matter.\"\nProfessor Owen says that another, less ideological factor in the decline of the death penalty is an ongoing shortage of lethal injection drugs in the US, which in some cases led to drug cocktails that created botched executions that have \"contributed to the growing skepticism\" toward the practice.\nIn order to contend with these shortages, however, many states, especially in the South, have legalized older methods, such as gas chambers, electric chairs, or firing squads. Arkansas plans to execute an unprecedented seven prisoners over 11 days starting next week in order to beat the upcoming expiration date of the state's remaining lethal injection drugs.\nMost states occupy a middle position on the death penalty: Often, they will sentence criminals to death, but not actually carry out the execution.\n\"Recent polling shows the lowest level of support for the death penalty since the 1970s,\" says Griffin Hardy, communications coordinator for the Ministry Against the Death Penalty, a Catholic anti-capital punishment group, in a phone interview. \"Referenda on the death penalty in California, Nebraska, and Oklahoma may indicate continued public support for keeping the death penalty on the books, but it is worth noting that each of these states faces significant obstacles in resuming executions. The death penalty is an empty promise to victims' families in the majority of states that legally retain the option to execute prisoners.\"\nHardy says that the death penalty in the US is on the way out – not a question of \"if,\" but \"when.\"\nBut countries like China, the No. 1 executor of criminals, may not let go of practice as quickly.\n\"China retains the death penalty as a legal punishment for a wide range of crimes, including some nonviolent offenses [and political suppression],\" Hardy says. \"It is difficult to gauge trends in China's use of the death penalty due to the scarcity of statistics, but it seems that the number of executions is down from the ten-thousands to the thousands.\"\nBy comparison, Iran, which holds the No. 2 spot, executed 567 people last year. In third place is Saudi Arabia, with 154 executions, with Iraq trailing in fourth place, with 88.\n\"A record high number of executions were carried out worldwide in 2015, so the decrease in 2016 must be viewed in that context,\" Mr. Hardy points out.\nFollow Stories Like This\nSign Up\nWhile the US is not the only country in the Americas to assign the death penalty to criminals in 2016, it is the only country in the region to have actually carried out the death penalty in the past eight years, according to the Amnesty report. In the US, 2,832 people were living on death row as of the end of 2016.\n\"Use of the death penalty in the USA is at its lowest since the early 1990s,\" said Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, in a statement. \"But we have to fight to keep it that way.\""},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jun/09/the-schoolgirl-thrash-metal-band-smashing-stereotypes-java-indonesia-voice-baceprot","title":"The schoolgirl thrash metal band smashing stereotypes in Indonesia | Kate Lamb","author_text":"Kate Lamb","keywords":["Global Development","Metal","Music","Culture","Pop And Rock","Indonesia","Asia Pacific","World News"],"publication_text":"the Guardian","description":"Taking Rage Against the Machine and Slipknot as inspiration, three Muslim teenagers are blasting their way into the Asian music scene as Voice of Baceprot","date":"2017-06-09","full_text":"It was a dull day in music class that ignited a rebellion in three Indonesian teenage girls.\nPoring over their school teacher’s music collection, the hijab-wearing schoolgirls from conservative West Java discovered a trove of heavy metal.\n“I just fell in love with metal since that first time I heard it. It felt so rebellious,” said 16-year-old Firdda Kurnia. “I think we found ourselves in the music.”\nKurnia is vocalist and guitarist of Voice of Baceprot, the metal group she formed in 2014 with drummer Eusi Siti Aisyah and bassist Widi Rahmawati. The band is now blasting its way into the Asian music scene, causing consternation among more conservative peers and bringing the three young women death threats and hate mail.\nVoB, as they are known, have achieved acclaim throughout Java and appeared on national television, reward for the dedication of the band members who every day after school diligently practised their thrash metal riffs and brainstormed original lyrics.\nThis week the young women skipped school to travel four hours by road to the capital Jakarta to perform live on national TV.\n“Mostly I like bands from outside,” said Kurnia earnestly, as the band waited in the green room before going on set. “You know – like Slipknot, Rage Against the Machine and Lamb of God.”\nThe girls were dressed in black skinny jeans, matching black headscarves and thigh-length T-shirts emblazoned with the letters VoB, not only an abbreviation of the band’s name but a word that means “noisy” in their ethnic Sundanese language.\nTheir merchandise also boasts VoB’s tagline: “The other side of metallism”.\n“Many people think metal music is satanic but we are showing that there is a different shade, a different side to the music,” said Erza Satia, 35, the music teacher who introduced the girls to heavy metal, and is now their manager.\nIn the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, Satia said music is a constructive, creative way for his students to avoid vices such as drugs and “free sex”, the term used to cover any pre-marital sex. Some 90 % of Indonesia’s population of 250 million is Muslim and most are decidedly moderate, but in relatively conservative West Java, the all-girl band has raised many eyebrows and a few haters.\nIndeed, Satia has received threatening phone calls pressuring him to break up the band, while religious leaders have tried to obstruct VoB’s concerts – in one case pulling out the power cord to cut the sound.\nAt home too, the girls’ parents were initially uneasy. Today though, points out drummer Siti, her mum is proudly watching her on TV.\nAs the band’s reputation has grown, so too has the support and pride of their family and community.\n“We can play metal and protect our morals. Of course Islam and metal can match. Why not?” said Kurnia. “Metal is a just a genre of music.

It produces great ponds of brilliant blue melt water at the surface.\nSuch warm, downslope winds are well known across the Earth, of course; and they all have a local name.\nThe chinook winds, for example, that drop over the Rockies and Cascades in North America are the exact same thing.\nFoehn is just the title they garnered originally in Europe's Alps. And while their presence on the White Continent has also long been recognised, the BAS study is really the first effort to try to quantify their behaviour.\nExamining data from 2009 to 2012, Turton and colleagues identified over 200 foehn episodes a year.\nThat makes them more frequent than anyone had thought previously. And the range is broader, too, with occurrences being recorded much further south on the Peninsula.\nThis all means their melting influence on the eastern shelf ice has very likely been underestimated.\n\"In summer, we expect some melt, around 2mm per day. But in spring we’re having an equal amount of melt as we are in summer during the foehn winds,\" Ms Turton told BBC News.\n\"That's significant because it’s making the melt onset earlier. We kind of expect melt in January/February time; but we’re also seeing it sometimes in September/October, in particularly frequent foehn wind conditions.\"\nIs the Larsen C Ice Shelf being conditioned for a break-up?\nThe dominant winds blowing in the Antarctic Peninsula region are westerlies\nAs their air parcels rise over the mountains, they cool and lose their moisture\nThe descending air parcels (foehn wind) on the other side are therefore dry\nLeeward air is also 5-10 degrees warmer than the equivalent windward altitude\nTurton presented the foehn research at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna.\nIt is timely work because there is considerable interest currently in the status of the Larsen C Ice Shelf - a floating projection from the Peninsula that is the size of Wales.\nScientists are wondering if this shelf will follow the demise of its siblings, Larsen A and Larsen B, further to the north.\nThese collapsed in 1995 and 2002, respectively; Larson B doing so in spectacular style.\nLarsen C shares some similarities - notably, the presence of those summer melt pools.\nThis liquid water is problematic because of the way it can seep into crevasses and help to open them up.\nThe water pushes down on the fissures, driving them through to the base of the shelf in a process known as hydrofracturing. They weaken the shelf.\n\"The thing about Larsen B though was that it was covered in them,\" recalled Prof Bernd Kulessa from Swansea University.\n\"By the time the shelf reached a really weak state, there were literally thousands of ponds. On Larsen C, the ponds are still very much focussed in the inlets (close to the mountains). There are few ponds on the shelf itself and so it is not quite as pre-conditioned.\"\nDrawing a lot of attention at the moment is the big iceberg calving event occurring on Larsen C. A mass of ice some 5,000 sq km in area is about to break away.\nWhen the monster berg does detach, it could change the way stress is configured and managed by the remaining shelf structure.\nIt is interesting to note that the collapses of Larsen A and B were also preceded by major calvings. But these are not swift processes. They do not happen the day after tomorrow; they can take very many years to complete.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Enable it in your browser or download Flash Player here.Sorry, you need Flash to play this.\nNew aerial video of the ice crack has been released by the British Antarctic Survey\nExit player\nPresently, the putative Larsen C berg is hanging on to the shelf by a 20km stretch of ice. And the crack that will set it free has actually slowed its pace of late.\n\"It's entered a suture zone which is soft - softer because the ice is warmer and has more water content,\" Swansea's Prof Adrian Luckman told BBC News.\n\"As a result the crack cannot propagate as fast as it has done through the colder ice. So, it will be stuck in this suture zone for some time to come. However, where we're measuring the rift width, which is at the point where it broke through the first suture zone it came across - it continues to open by about a metre a day.\"\nIn total, that's a gap of more than 450m.\nProf Luckman is monitoring the crack’s position with the European Union's Sentinel-1 satellites.

Her race for a cure is now a movement.","date":"2016-01-22","full_text":"Back in December of 2011, Emily Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded Emily’s Entourage, a charitable foundation dedicated to finding a cure for the particular strain of cystic fibrosis (CF) from which Kramer-Golinkoff suffers. Initially, the non-profit’s goal was to raise $50,000 to further research her “nonsense” mutation of CF.\nWhen we last spoke with Kramer-Golinkoff in September of 2015, she and her team had raised $1.5 million, held two national symposiums, and even appeared at the White House, where Kramer-Golinkoff was named one of nine “Champions for Change.” Despite shattering initial expectations and funding goals, Kramer-Golinkoff and her team had no intentions of stopping.\nSince September, Emily’s Entourage has continued to ride a wave of momentum. Along with drastically increasing the amount of funding and research available to the CF community, the group has also gained some much deserved attention and notoriety.\nShe was featured on CBS Philly, NBC10 and Main Line Today, on the websites of Time and People magazines, and appeared on TV’s syndicated The Doctors where she shared her story with a national audience. At the end of the show, the hosts surprised her with a $10,000 check to fund more research.\n“The past few months have been a whirlwind,” Kramer-Golinkoff says. At their annual gala on December 5th, Emily’s Entourage kicked off a fundraising campaign that spanned until Kramer-Golinkoff’s birthday on January 9th. In that time, they were able to raise nearly $400,000, and with such monumental fundraising achievements came significant amounts of media exposure.\nIn addition to being featured on local news outlets such as CBS Philly, NBC10 and Main Line Today, Kramer-Golinkoff’s story has also gained national attention. She was featured on the websites of Time and People magazines, and appeared on TV’s syndicated The Doctors where she shared her story with a national audience. At the end of the show, the hosts surprised her with a $10,000 check to fund more research.\n“I’m overcome with extreme gratitude,” Kramer-Golinkoff says when asked about all the attention. “It has shown me that people have really big hearts and they’re really eager to help.”\nStill, Kramer-Golinkoff’s condition worsens every day, adding dire urgency to her race against time. “I’m never far from the reality of why we’re doing this,” she says. “My condition is deteriorating, so we’re constantly hustling and can’t afford to take breathers.”\nThere have been strides made in many sectors of CF research, but no cure for her mutation has been found yet.\n“It’s very bittersweet,” she says. “I never feel frustrated or discouraged, but sometimes I do feel a little envious. I think it’s really sort of a motivator.”\nStill, Kramer-Golinkoff’s condition worsens every day, adding dire urgency to her race against time. “I’m never far from the reality of why we’re doing this,” she says. “My condition is deteriorating, so we’re constantly hustling and can’t afford to take breathers.”\nEmily’s Entourage has a number of upcoming events designed to both grow the CF support community and raise more money for research and a potential breakthrough. The organization will be hosting yoga and spin classes throughout the winter and spring that are open to the public.\nAlong with organizing fundraising efforts and events, Kramer-Golinkoff and her team are in constant contact with scientists and researchers who are using every dime raised by Emily’s Entourage to help find a cure. “Our goal is to work very fast and find a breakthrough,” she explains.\nGiven recent breakthroughs in CF research, those still searching for a cure for their particular mutations have new senses of hope and optimism. And despite having a particularly rare mutation of CF, Kramer-Golinkoff never feels alone or isolated from the CF community—even though those with CF are unable to be in the same room together because it could lead to health complications. “The community is strictly virtual,” she says.\nMaya Angelou once said, “If you don’t like something, change it. If you can’t change it, change your attitude.”\nKramer-Golinkoff is all about the transformative nature of attitude. What started with a dream to raise $50,000 has turned into a brigade that continues to push forward with a laser focus and a collective refusal to slow down. Even when Emily’s Entourage reaches its goal of finding a cure, Kramer-Golinkoff says she won’t stop. Instead, she and her mom will work together to cure another disease and save more lives.\nFirst, though, there’s one thing Kramer-Golinkoff plans on doing: “My family always had a plan that when there was a cure we were going to take all our friends and family and go on a hot air balloon ride,” she says. “That’s how we’ll celebrate.”\nFitting for someone with such sky-high ambition."},{"url":"http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/17/tech-adoption-climbs-among-older-adults","title":"Tech Adoption Climbs Among Older Adults","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Pew Research Center: Internet, Science \u0026 Tech","description":"Nearly two-thirds of those age 65 and older go online and a record share now own smartphones – although many seniors remain relatively divorced from digital l","date":"2017-05-17","full_text":"A record 46 million seniors live in the United States today, and older Americans – those age 65 and older – now account for 15% of the overall U.S. population. By 2050, 22% of Americans will be 65 and older, according to U.S. Census Bureau projections.1\nAt the same time America is graying, recent Pew Research Center surveys find that seniors are also moving towards more digitally connected lives. Around four-in-ten (42%) adults ages 65 and older now report owning smartphones, up from just 18% in 2013. Internet use and home broadband adoption among this group have also risen substantially. Today, 67% of seniors use the internet – a 55-percentage-point increase in just under two decades. And for the first time, half of older Americans now have broadband at home.\nYet despite these gains, many seniors remain largely disconnected from the digital revolution. One-third of adults ages 65 and older say they never use the internet, and roughly half (49%) say they do not have home broadband services. Meanwhile, even with their recent gains, the proportion of seniors who say they own smartphones is 42 percentage points lower than those ages 18 to 64.\nAnd as is true for the population as a whole, there are also substantial differences in technology adoption within the older adult population based on factors such as age, household income and educational attainment.\nSeniors ages 65 to 69 are about twice as likely as those ages 80 and older to say they ever go online (82% vs. 44%) or have broadband at home (66% vs. 28%), and they are roughly four times as likely to say they own smartphones (59% vs. 17%).\nAdoption rates also vary greatly by household income. Fully 87% of seniors living in households earning $75,000 or more a year say they have home broadband, compared with just 27% of seniors whose annual household income is below $30,000. Educational differences follow a similar pattern, with college graduates adopting technology at much higher rates than seniors with lower levels of formal education.\nThese younger, relatively affluent and/or highly educated seniors are helping to drive much of the recent growth in technology adoption among the older population as a whole. For example, smartphone ownership among seniors whose annual household income is $75,000 or more increased by 39 percentage points since 2013 – 15 points higher than the growth reported among seniors overall.\nIt also remains the case that older adults face unique barriers to using and adopting new technologies. Some 34% of older internet users say they have little to no confidence in their ability to use electronic devices to perform online tasks, while 48% of seniors say that this statement describes them very well: “When I get a new electronic device, I usually need someone else to set it up or show me how to use it.”\nStill, older Americans who use the internet tend to view technology in a positive light and incorporate digital technology into their everyday lives. Fully 58% of adults ages 65 and older say technology has had a mostly positive impact on society, while roughly three-quarters of internet-using seniors say they go online on a daily basis – and nearly one-in-ten go online almost constantly.\nThese findings are based on several nationally representative Pew Research Center surveys. The main findings on technology adoption are from a phone survey of 3,015 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 29-Nov. 6, 2016. The margin of sampling error at the 95% confidence interval for results based on the total sample is plus or minus 2 percentage points. Details about the other surveys used in this report are available in the methodology. The terms “seniors”, “older Americans” and “older adults” are used interchangeably in this report to denote adults living in the U.S. who are ages 65 and older.\nTech Adoption Climbs Among Older Adults\nAlthough seniors consistently have lower rates of technology adoption than the general public, this group is more digitally connected than ever. In fact, some groups of seniors – such as those who are younger, more affluent and more highly educated – report owning and using various technologies at rates similar to adults under the age of 65.\nStill, there remains a notable digital divide between younger and older Americans. And many seniors who are older, less affluent or with lower levels of educational attainment continue to have a distant relationship with digital technology.\nFour-in-ten seniors now own smartphones, more than double the share that did so in 2013\nWith smartphone ownership in the U.S. more than doubling in the past five years, Americans are embracing mobile technology at a rapid pace. And while adoption rates among seniors continue to trail those of the overall population, the share of adults ages 65 and up who own smartphones has risen 24 percentage points (from 18% to 42%) since 2013. Today, roughly half of older adults who own cellphones have some type of smartphone; in 2013, that share was just 23%.\nSmartphone ownership among seniors varies substantially by age: 59% of 65- to 69-year-olds own smartphones, but that share falls to 49% among 70- to 74-year-olds. Smartphone adoption drops off considerably among adults in their mid-70s and beyond. Some 31% of 75- to 79-year-olds say they own smartphones, while only 17% of those ages 80 and older are smartphone owners.\nSmartphone ownership is also highly correlated with household income and educational attainment. Fully 81% of older Americans whose annual household income is $75,000 or more say they own smartphones, compared with 27% of those living in households earning less than $30,000 a year. Additionally, around two-thirds of seniors with bachelor’s or advanced degrees report owning smartphones (65%), compared with 45% of those who have some college experience and 27% of those who have high school diplomas or less.\nSeniors in these high-adoption groups have seen the largest growth in smartphone ownership in recent years. Since 2013, smartphone adoption among older adults who live in households earning $75,000 or more a year has increased by 39 percentage points; those with at least bachelor’s degrees, as well as those who are ages 65 to 69, have each seen a 30-point increase in smartphone adoption over that time.\nInternet use and broadband adoption among seniors varies across demographic groups\nAs is true of the population as a whole, internet adoption among seniors has risen steadily over the last decade and a half. When the Center began tracking internet adoption in early 2000, just 14% of seniors were internet users. But today, 67% of adults ages 65 and older say they go online.\nThe share of seniors who subscribe to home broadband services has also risen – albeit at a slower rate than internet use. Around half of seniors (51%) now say they have high-speed internet at home. This represents a modest uptick from 2013, when 47% of older adults were broadband adopters.\nAs is true of the general public, internet and broadband adoption among older adults varies substantially across a number of demographic factors – most notably age, household income and educational attainment.\nYounger seniors use the internet and subscribe to home broadband at rates that are comparable to the overall population. Fully 82% of 65- to 69-year-olds are internet users, and two-thirds say they have broadband internet connections at home. (Internet use and broadband adoption rates for the overall population are 90% and 73%, respectively).\nOn the other hand, fewer than half of seniors ages 80 and up (44%) report using the internet and just 28% say they have home broadband service. Adoption rates for seniors in their 70s fall in between these two groups.\nInternet and broadband adoption rates also differ considerably by household income and educational attainment. Around nine-in-ten seniors whose annual household income is $75,000 or more say they go online (94%) or have high-speed internet at home (87%). Those shares drop to 46% and 27%, respectively, among older adults living in households earning less than $30,000 a year. College graduates are far more likely than those with high school educations or less to say they use the internet (92% vs. 49%) or have home broadband service (82% vs. 30%).\nTablet ownership grows among older Americans, while e-reader adoption stalls\nRoughly one-third (32%) of seniors say they own tablet computers, while about one-in-five (19%) report owning e-readers. While this represents a double-digit increase in tablet ownership since 2013, the share of older Americans who own e-readers has stayed largely unchanged over that time period. (This mirrors adoption trends in the broader population as well).\nTablet ownership is especially common among seniors with more education and those living in higher-income households. Some 62% of older adults with annual household incomes of $75,000 or more say they own tablet computers, while 56% of college-degree earners say the same. Each represents a more than 20-point increase since 2013 (at that point, 39% of high-income seniors and 31% of college graduates in this age group owned tablets).\nBy comparison, fewer than one-in-five seniors in households earning less than $30,000 a year (16%) or who have high school diplomas or less (18%) own tablets. E-reader adoption follows a similar pattern, albeit from a lower baseline level of overall ownership.\nYounger seniors are also more likely than their older counterparts to own tablets or e-readers, although these differences are especially pronounced in the case of tablets. Some 41% of 65- to 69-year-olds report having tablet computers, compared with 20% of those ages 80 and older. The age gap in e-reader ownership is narrower: 21% of 65-to 69-year-olds and 13% of those ages 80 and older are e-reader owners.\nSocial media use among older Americans steadily increases\nSocial media is increasingly becoming an important platform where people find news and information, share their experiences and connect with friends and family. And just as internet adoption and smartphone ownership has grown among seniors, so has social media use.\nToday, 34% of Americans ages 65 and up say they ever use social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter. This represents a seven-point increase from 2013, when 27% of older adults reported using social media. Still, a majority of seniors do not use social media, and the share that do is considerably smaller than that of the general population.\nAs with other forms of digital technology, younger seniors are more likely than their older counterparts to use social media. More than four-in-ten (45%) seniors under the age of 75 say they ever use social networking sites, compared with 20% of those ages 75 and older. Social networking use is also relatively common among those who have at least some college experience and those whose annual household income is $50,000 or more.\nDigital technology has transformed the way people communicate, get news, shop and even find love. And as more tasks migrate online, there are unique barriers and challenges that may hinder some older Americans from going online and using new technology. But despite these challenges, many seniors have a positive outlook about technology and the benefits it can provide. And once online, many older adults engage deeply with online content and activities.\nOlder adults face unique barriers to adoption, ranging from physical challenges to a lack of comfort and familiarity with technology\nOne challenge facing older adults with respect to technology is the fact that many are simply not confident in their own ability to learn about and properly use electronic devices.\nFor example, just 26% of internet users ages 65 and over say they feel very confident when using computers, smartphones or other electronic devices to do the things they need to do online, according to a 2015 Pew Research Center survey. Roughly one-third describe themselves as only a little (23%) or not at all (11%) confident in their ability to use electronic devices to do necessary online activities.\nSimilarly, a 2016 report from the Center found that “digitally ready” Americans – meaning those who are confident in their digital skills and in their ability to find trustworthy information online – tend to be disproportionately under the age of 65. Meanwhile, older groups make up a larger share of those who are described as “digitally unprepared.”\nHand in hand with this lack of confidence in their own ability to use digital technology, seniors are also more likely than those in other age groups to say they need others to show them how to use new devices. Around three-quarters of Americans ages 65 and up say the statement, “When I get a new electronic device, I usually need someone else to set it up or show me how to use it,” describes them either very (48%) or somewhat (25%) well.\nOlder adults may also face physical challenges that might make it difficult to use or manipulate devices. Some 28% of U.S. adults ages 65 and up say they have health problems, disabilities or handicaps that keep them from participating fully in work, school, housework or other activities.2 And seniors who report that they have a disability are less likely than those who do not to utilize a variety of digital assets – from the internet in general, to devices such as smartphones or tablet computers.3\nOnce seniors are online, they engage at high levels with digital devices and content\nOnce online, most seniors make the internet a standard part of their daily routine. Roughly three-quarters of older internet users go online at least daily, including 17% who say they go online about once a day, 51% who indicate they do so several times a day and 8% who say they use the internet almost constantly. Among older adults who own smartphones, this figure is even higher: 76% of these smartphone-owning older adults use the internet several times a day or more.\nSimilarly, a relatively small share of older adults use social media – but those who use these platforms tend to be highly active and engaged. For instance, fully 70% of older adults who use Facebook indicate that they log in to the service on a daily basis. Other Pew Research Center surveys have found that older adults who say they get news on social media engage with news on these platforms at similar rates as social media news consumers who are ages 18 to 29.\nAnd even though playing video games is much more common among younger adults, many seniors are taking part in this tech-based activity. One-in-four adults ages 65 or older say they play online video games, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2015.\nMost older adults say technology has had a mostly positive impact on society\nDespite these concerns and challenges, there are a number of areas in which seniors hold relatively positive views of technology and technology-related topics. For instance, at a broad level, 58% of seniors feel that technology has had a mostly positive effect on society, while just 4% feel that impact has been mostly negative.\nAlthough older adults are less inclined than other age groups to say they like trying new technology, some seniors do show a strong preference for early tech adoption. On a six-item index that classifies Americans’ preferences for new technology and products, around one-in-five adults ages 65 and older (21%) hold strong preferences for being early tech adopters.4\nSeniors also place a high value on the importance of home broadband service, according to a survey conducted by the Center in 2017. The vast majority of adults ages 65 and older say they believe having access to high-speed internet at home is either essential (42%) or important (49%). This puts older Americans on par with Americans of other ages when it comes to the importance of home broadband service.\nDue to the nature of the surveys associated with this data, certain Americans with disabilities are likely undercounted. The figures reported are from phone surveys that were conducted via landlines and cellphones and likely under covered adults who are deaf or have difficulty speaking. In addition, our surveys do not cover those living in institutionalized group quarters, which may include some severely disabled individuals. ↩\nPew Research Center created an “early adopter index” that classifies Americans’ preferences for new technology products based on six survey questions. See Pew Research Center’s 2016 blog post “28% of Americans are ‘strong’ early adopters of technology.” ↩\nThis report was made possible by The Pew Charitable Trusts. It is a collaborative effort based on the input and analysis of the following individuals:\nPrimary researchers\nMonica Anderson, Research Associate\nAndrew Perrin, Research Assistant\nResearch team\nAaron Smith, Associate Director, Research\nLee Rainie, Director, Internet, Science and Technology Research\nClaudia Deane, Vice President, Research\nKenny Olmstead, Research Associate\nEditorial and graphic design\nMargaret Porteus, Information Graphics Designer\nShannon Greenwood, Copy editor\nCommunications and web publishing\nDana Page, Senior Communications Manager\nShannon Greenwood, Associate Digital Producer\nThe analysis in this report is based on several Pew Research Center surveys. The main findings on technology adoption are from a telephone survey of 3,015 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 29-Nov. 6, 2016. Fully 757 respondents were interviewed on landline telephones, and 2,258 were interviewed on cellphones, including 1,342 who had no landline telephones.\nThe findings on frequency of internet use are based on a Pew Research Center phone survey conducted March 7-April 4, 2016, among a national sample of 1,520 U.S. adults. The margin of error for the full sample is of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Fully 381 respondents were interviewed on landline telephones, and 1,139 were interviewed on cellphones, including 636 who had no landline telephones.\nThe findings on confidence and whether people need assistance when using electronic devices is based on a phone survey of 2,752 U.S. adults conducted Oct. 13-Nov. 15, 2015. The margin of error for the full sample is of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points. Fully 963 respondents were interviewed on landline telephones, and 1,789 were interviewed on cellphones, including 1,059 who had no landline telephones.\nEach of these surveys was conducted by interviewers at Princeton Data Source under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International. A combination of landline and cellphone random-digit-dial samples were used; both samples were provided by Survey Sampling International. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Respondents in the landline sample were selected by randomly asking for the youngest adult male or female who was at home. Interviews in the cellphone sample were conducted with the person who answered the phone, if that person was 18 years of age or older. For detailed information about our survey methodology, visit: http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/u-s-survey-research/\nThe combined landline and cellphone samples are weighted using an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin and nativity, and region to parameters from the 2013 Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and population density to parameters from the Decennial Census. The sample also is weighted to match current patterns of telephone status (landline only, cellphone only or both landline and cellphone) based on extrapolations from the 2014 National Health Interview Survey. The weighting procedure also accounts for the fact that respondents with both landlines and cellphones have a greater probability of being included in the combined sample and adjusts for household size among respondents with landline phones. The margins of error reported and statistical tests of significance are adjusted to account for the survey’s design effect, a measure of how much efficiency is lost from the weighting procedures.\nThe data on perceptions of technology’s impact on society is from a survey conducted as part of the American Trends Panel (ATP), created by Pew Research Center, a nationally representative panel of randomly selected U.S. adults living in households. Respondents who self-identify as internet users and who provided an email address participate in the panel via monthly self-administered web surveys, and those who do not use the internet or decline to provide an email address participate via the mail. The panel is being managed by Abt SRBI. Data in this report are drawn primarily from the March wave of the panel, conducted March 2-28, 2016, among 4,726 respondents (4,243 by web and 483 by mail). The margin of sampling error for the full sample of 4,726 respondents from the March wave is plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.\nMembers of the American Trends Panel were recruited from two large, national landline and cellphone random-digit-dial (RDD) surveys conducted in English and Spanish. At the end of each survey, respondents were invited to join the panel. The first group of panelists were recruited from the 2014 Political Polarization and Typology Survey, conducted from Jan. 23 to March 16, 2014.\nThe margin of error for the Sept. 29-Nov. 6, 2016, survey is plus or minus 2.0 percentage points. The following table shows the unweighted sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey:\nIn addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.\nPew Research Center undertakes all polling activity, including calls to mobile telephone numbers, in compliance with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and other applicable laws.\nPew Research Center is a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization and a subsidiary of The Pew Charitable Trusts, its primary funder."},{"url":"https://ensia.com/update/high-quality-independent-journalism","title":"Now more than ever we need high-quality, independent journalism","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Ensia","description":"Whatever your feelings on the outcome of last week’s U.S. presidential election, this is a momentous time in America and around the world.","date":"","full_text":"Todd Reubold\n@treubold\nNovember 16, 2016 — Whatever your feelings on the outcome of last week’s U.S. presidential election, this is a momentous time in America and around the world.\nSome of our readers may be feeling excited about the future, while others are anxious about what comes next. As Ensia’s publisher, I want to share a few thoughts on what the election means for our magazine.\nFirst, let me emphasize that Ensia is, and always has been, inherently apolitical. We believe that environmental issues are everyone’s issues, regardless of political persuasion or affiliation, and we strive to provide high-quality journalism without favoring a liberal or conservative perspective. We believe that the right way to report on environmental challenges is with an eye to solutions. And we believe that solutions can come from all directions — with the very best tending to emerge where diverse perspectives come together in pursuit of common goals.\nSecond, it is important to remember that although the U.S. federal government is a powerful force, it is far from the only force shaping our future. A big role for Ensia in the months ahead is to ramp up our efforts to engage and inform the many other movers and shakers that are in a position to step up to the plate: corporations, non-governmental organizations, other nations and other levels of government within the U.S.\nNow more than ever, we need to commit ourselves to producing high-quality, independent journalism. Now more than ever, we need to ensure that fact-based, solutions-focused reporting reaches beyond those who are self-motivated to seek out environment-related news.\nEnsia’s mission is to share stories and ignite conversations that motivate and empower people — all people — to create a more sustainable future. The 2016 presidential election has not changed that. What it has done is remind us of the diversity of perspectives the people we strive to serve bring to the conversation. It has underscored the importance of Ensia’s unique approach to environmental journalism. And it has inspired us to double down on our efforts to provide the best in environmental journalism to leaders of all kinds across geographies and ideologies as we strive together to shape a world future generations can live with.\nIf you agree this is what’s needed in these changing times, we welcome you to support our work."},{"url":"http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Could-this-San-Francisco-tech-CEO-s-show-pull-11186597.php","title":"Could this San Francisco tech CEO’s show pull Fox to the middle?","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"San Francisco Chronicle","description":"On Sunday, a new show will debut on Fox News hosted by San Francisco tech CEO Steve Hilton.

Balding with large blue eyes, he’s more contrarian than conservative, perhaps the only tech CEO who doesn’t own a cell phone, hasn’t since 2012.  Yet Sunday’s launch of “The Next Revolution With Steve Hilton” on Fox makes sense in a rapidly changing cable world where former Fox stars Megyn Kelly and Greta Von Susteren have migrated to NBC and MSNBC, respectively, Fox ratings king Bill O’Reilly is out of a job and Ailes, the disgraced architect of the conservative network, is dead.  Not only will it be recorded in Los Angeles, but it will likely reflect how Hilton, 47, has been shaped less by Beltway partisanship and more by Silicon Valley’s less-partisan culture since he moved to the United States a half-dozen years ago.  The Atherton resident leads Crowdpac, a nonpartisan San Francisco online hub that tries to lessen the impact of big money in politics by making it easier for people to run for office as well as give voters the ability to organize around issues.  “The Next Revolution” will focus on the populism that powered the campaigns of both President Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders, independent-Vt.  Hilton wants to know where this wave of political energy is coming from, where it is going and how it can be turned into what he calls “positive populism,” instead of just more rage at the machine.  “Let’s turn that energy in a positive direction towards real reforms and real changes that actually improves people's lives,” he said.  If Trump doesn’t, as promised, “drain the swamp” of the power of the elite, “then the rage at the system is going to be even greater,” Hilton said.  If the room is spinning right now for you, it’s OK to take a minute to lie down as we ponder the big question:  Is Fox going to let Hilton riff on how the political system is rigged and invoke the name of Sanders in a positive way and possibly say something less than glowing about the Republican president?

He’s a T-shirt and loose jacket-wearing Brit, a former top adviser to conservative Prime Minister David Cameron. Balding with large blue eyes, he’s more contrarian than conservative, perhaps the only tech CEO who doesn’t own a cell phone, hasn’t since 2012. He asks friends to call an Uber for him.\nYet Sunday’s launch of “The Next Revolution With Steve Hilton” on Fox makes sense in a rapidly changing cable world where former Fox stars Megyn Kelly and Greta Von Susteren have migrated to NBC and MSNBC, respectively, Fox ratings king Bill O’Reilly is out of a job and Ailes, the disgraced architect of the conservative network, is dead.\nAt this unsettled moment, Hilton has the chance to grasp that most elusive thing in political chat these days: the middle ground.\nWhat could make his show different than most of the cable noise is that it will have a distinctly West Coast flair, in attitude as well as geography. Not only will it be recorded in Los Angeles, but it will likely reflect how Hilton, 47, has been shaped less by Beltway partisanship and more by Silicon Valley’s less-partisan culture since he moved to the United States a half-dozen years ago.\nThe Atherton resident leads Crowdpac, a nonpartisan San Francisco online hub that tries to lessen the impact of big money in politics by making it easier for people to run for office as well as give voters the ability to organize around issues.\nThe level-the-playing-field ethos of Crowdpac — the company is not affiliated with the show — fits in with the theme of Hilton’s Fox venture.\n“The Next Revolution” will focus on the populism that powered the campaigns of both President Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders, independent-Vt. It will also be informed by Hilton’s international experience as a domestic policy adviser at 10 Downing St. under Cameron. Hilton broke with his former boss last year when he endorsed Brexit.\nHilton wants to know where this wave of political energy is coming from, where it is going and how it can be turned into what he calls “positive populism,” instead of just more rage at the machine.\n“Let’s turn that energy in a positive direction towards real reforms and real changes that actually improves people's lives,” he said. “That actually helps them get jobs — that if they’re in work, helps them raise their incomes,” he said.\nThat’s why he started Crowdpac in 2014, because so many people think “the whole system is owned and controlled by insiders, by big donors — on the the left and the right, it’s all the same.\nThe system, Hilton said, is “rigged” and impotent to deal with “these really, really big problems that are really hurting people.”\n“I think the scale we need is revolutionary. Bernie Sanders talked about a political revolution — I really related to that message. I think we need much bigger change than a few different policies here or there.” said Hilton, who described his politics in his 2015 book, “More Human: Designing a World Where People Come First,” as a combination of Sanders, libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and GOP Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\nAs for Trump, Hilton said it’s too early to grade the president on whether he has fulfilled the populist promises of his campaign. But in several months, Hilton plans to grade him first and foremost on what got him elected: The growing frustration among many working-class Americans about their wages remaining flat while the rich have gotten richer.\nIf Trump doesn’t, as promised, “drain the swamp” of the power of the elite, “then the rage at the system is going to be even greater,” Hilton said.\nIf the room is spinning right now for you, it’s OK to take a minute to lie down as we ponder the big question: Is Fox going to let Hilton riff on how the political system is rigged and invoke the name of Sanders in a positive way and possibly say something less than glowing about the Republican president?\nHilton thinks so.\n“I’m going to be myself,” he said, and from the beginning of his courtship with Fox, executives there told him, “We’re really interested in you and what you have to say and you’re in the driving seat. And that’s really been the case. It’s been really a fantastic experience. I’m bringing myself to Fox. The audience may like it, they may not like it, but that’s what I’m going to be doing.”\nOthers will wonder how he can work for Fox at a time when its workplace has been roiled by accusations of sexual harassment. O’Reilly was fired after an April New York Times report that he or the company had paid $13 million to settle five cases alleging sexual or other forms of harassment. (O’Reilly denied the accusations.) Less than a year before, Ailes left the company after several women alleged forms of harassment against him, which he denied.\nBut Hilton said that has not been his experience at the network.\n“I’m the new boy and totally at the bottom of the pecking order, so I can’t speak to what’s gone on in the past. But I can speak to my experience, and my experience has been that it has been a totally, modern professional respectful organization.”\nHilton came west after his wife, Rachel Whetstone — they met as young political operatives in England — got a top communications job at Google. Hilton landed a teaching gig at Stanford University's Institute of Design, colloquially know as the d.school.\nHilton calls it the most “transformational” chapter in his career. He began to see the world differently. He learned how to lead a team better, to understand and appreciate feedback, to communicate better. If he had those skills when he was in government, he said, he would have been much more effective.\nAnd now he will try TV. The least of his worries is what his liberal friends in San Francisco will think of him gigging on Fox.\n“The social humiliation has been sort of total for years,” Hilton said dryly. “It was even worse when my wife worked at Uber. She was head of government relations and public relations. So there was a time when she was at Uber and I was at Fox and we literally couldn’t go out.”\nJoe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle’s senior political writer.

","date":"","full_text":"A prominent Boston neurosurgeon was illegally forced out of his previous job at a New York hospital for strongly objecting to a policy that allowed another surgeon to perform complex spine surgeries on two patients simultaneously, a judge ruled.\nDouble-booking, as the practice is sometimes called, triggered a fierce dispute among doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in recent years, leading to the 2015 dismissal of an orthopedic surgeon who opposed it. But Dr. James Holsapple may be the first doctor to win a lawsuit alleging he faced retaliation for challenging the practice.\nNew York Supreme Court Justice James P. Murphy ruled after a bench trial that University Hospital in Syracuse retaliated against Holsapple after he spoke out about the surgeon running two operating rooms at once.\n“Dr. Holsapple vehemently objected and opposed the procedures for valid public health and safety reasons,” Murphy ruled in a 13-page decision received by the neurosurgeon Monday.\nHolsapple, now chief of neurosurgery at Boston Medical Center, was awarded $88,277 in lost wages under the New York State whistle-blower statute. His lawyer estimated that the award could top $150,000 because Holsapple is entitled to interest on lost wages.\nHolsapple, who resigned under pressure from University Hospital in 2009 and moved to Boston, said he felt vindicated.\n“I did what I thought was right, and I’m grateful that the judge who heard the case saw it the same way,” said Holsapple, who heads the neurosurgery department at the Boston University School of Medicine.\nThe New York attorney general’s office, which defended University Hospital as part of the State University of New York, referred all questions to the hospital. Darryl Geddes, a hospital spokesman, said he could not comment because the attorney general’s office is considering an appeal.\nAccording to the judge, the controversy over simultaneous surgery at the hospital from 2006 through 2008 resembled a “bad soap opera,’’ with “competing egos, pettiness, and [an] overall lack of leadership.”\nHolsapple trained at the hospital starting in 1986 and rose to associate professor of neurosurgery. Around 2006, hospital leaders recruited Dr. Ross Moquin, a specialist in complex spine surgery, and gave him permission to routinely oversee two simultaneous surgeries in adjoining operating rooms, said the judge. Junior surgeons would assist Moquin, who would shuttle back and forth between the operating rooms.\nHolsapple “raised immediate concerns” because “the assisting surgeons were not qualified to perform the procedure should Dr. Moquin be delayed for any reason,’’ said the judge’s ruling.\nThat’s exactly what happened, according to Holsapple’s lawsuit. A patient suffered a serious spinal fluid leak after two surgeons not qualified to handle the procedure completed it because Moquin got stuck in another operating room.\nAfter Holsapple repeatedly complained about double-booking, the chairman of the neurosurgery department, Dr. Walter Hall, told him, “I am tired of your complaints,’’ according to the judge. Hall slashed Holsapple’s salary by stripping him of a number of appointments at the hospital, including residency coordinator, quality assurance officer, and pediatric neurosurgeon.\nHall did not testify at trial, the judge said, but said in a deposition that Holsapple never expressed concerns about double-booking to him. The judge said those comments were at odds with the testimony of other witnesses and “completely unbelievable.”\nThe judge also noted that in 2010 inspectors from the New York State Department of Health investigated University Hospital for many concerns that Holsapple had raised. The inspectors found the hospital had violated several state regulations.\nHolsapple demonstrated remarkable resilience for pursuing the lawsuit after he left Syracuse for Boston in 2009, his lawyer said.\n“Jim was more concerned about the patients he left behind and making sure the cesspool he left behind was cleaned up,’’ attorney Henry L. Saurborn Jr. of New York City said.\nHe said Holsapple’s case was the first verdict he knew of that found in favor of a whistle-blower who complained about concurrent surgery.\nBut a recent verdict in a medical malpractice lawsuit gave a more mixed message about double-booking.\nA Boston jury found in January that a spine surgeon at Mass. General failed to inform a Westwood financial analyst that he planned to operate on two patients at once, but the jury concluded that the doctor’s divided attention did not cause the man’s quadriplegia. That operation figured prominently in a Spotlight Team investigation of simultaneous surgeries at MGH and other teaching hospitals.\nClash in the Name of Care\nSince the series, many hospitals have restricted concurrent surgery, and the US Senate Finance Committee recently sought to curb it. In addition, the state Board of Registration in Medicine in January 2016 gave preliminary approval to rules that would require surgeons to document each time they enter and leave the operating room and to identify other medical personnel who would help the attending doctor, as part of a patient’s informed consent.\nThe medical board is expected to soon consider final approval of those requirements, which have drawn criticism from some doctors and hospitals as burdensome and impractical.\nJonathan Saltzman can be reached at jonathan.saltzman\n@globe.com."},{"url":"http://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/local/2017/05/28/man-killed-two-women-seriously-injured-east-el-paso-crash/352570001","title":"Man killed, two women seriously injured in East El Paso crash","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"El Paso Times","description":"Alcohol and speed are believed to be contributing factors in crash, police said.","date":"","full_text":"A man was killed and two female passengers were seriously injured during a single-car crash early Sunday morning in East El Paso, El Paso police reported.\nThe accident happened at about 12:45 a.m. Sunday along the 3900 block of Global Reach Drive, police said.\nThe preliminary investigation showed that a man was driving a 2009 Chevrolet Impala south along Global Reach when he lost control and struck the center median, causing his vehicle to roll, police said.\nMORE:\nThe driver and neither of the passengers have been identified, pending notification of family."},{"url":"http://wamu.org/story/17/05/17/d-c-police-looking-make-arrests-brutal-melee-outside-turkish-ambassadors-residence","title":"D.C.

Police Chief Peter Newsham said Wednesday that the department is reviewing video from a violent melee outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence on Tuesday with the hope of identifying those involved and making further arrests.\n“We have very good video. We have a good idea of some of the folks who were there on the scene, so I’m very comfortable that we will be able to identify most of the assailants and then we’re going to proceed accordingly,” he said during a press conference outside MPD headquarters.\nThe incident was sparked by a protest on Tuesday afternoon on Sheridan Circle, which is across from the Turkish ambassador’s residence. Roughly two-dozen opponents of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan were demonstrating in the circle, and at some point a violent confrontation between protesters and men in suits — identified in some reports as being part of Erdoğan’s security detail — occurred.\nVideo from the scene showed a number of violent assaults, as well as D.C. police and Secret Service struggling to break up fights and a number of men with blood streaming down their faces. Some of the men in suits were carrying guns, making the police response “dicey,” according to Newsham.\nSee the video from Voice of America Turkish service\n#Erdoğan'ın korumaları kavgaya karıştı https://t.co/gsi1iQ68Ye #amerikaninsesi pic.twitter.com/Jv3g5E7AVA\n— Amerika'nın Sesi (@VOATurkish) May 17, 2017\nHe called the attacks “unprovoked” and “very brutal,” and said that nine people were injured during the melee and that two arrests were made. Both of the people arrested live in the U.S., one in Fairfax County, and were charged with assault.\nNewsham also echoed an earlier statement from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who called the incident “an affront to D.C. values and our rights as Americans.”\n“That’s not something that we will tolerate here in Washington, D.C,” he said. “This is a city where people should be allowed to come and peacefully protest.”\nThe brawl erupted hours after a friendly White House meeting between Erdogan and President Donald Trump.\nDespite Newsham’s pledge to arrest anyone else police can identify, there remains questions as to whether any of them would be protected by diplomatic immunity, thus making it largely impossible for them to be prosecuted. The U.S. State Department did not answer any questions as to any immunity if any of Erdogan’s guards are found to have participated in the melee, but it did criticize what had happened in a statement.\n“We are concerned by the violent incidents involving protestors and Turkish security personnel Tuesday evening. Violence is never an appropriate response to free speech, and we support the rights of people everywhere to free expression and peaceful protest,” said department spokeswoman Heather Nauert.\n“We are communicating our concern to the Turkish government in the strongest possible terms,” she added.\nSome news reports said that the Secret Service detained two members of Erdogan’s security detail, but later released them. A spokesman for the agency only said that no arrests had been made after the incident.\n“There could be a diplomatic immunity issue, but that won’t prevent us from doing what we need to do here at the Metropolitan Police Department,” said Newsham.\nThis isn’t the first time Turkish political differences have spilled over into violent confrontation on D.C. streets. Last year, while Erdoğan spoke at the Brookings Institution, members of his security detail fought with protesters outside."},{"url":"https://ww2.kqed.org/futureofyou/2017/05/25/tristan-harris-brain-hacking","title":"Tech Insiders Call Out Facebook for Literally Manipulating Your Brain","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"KQED Future of You","description":"A former Google ethicist is on a crusade to make people aware of what he says are manipulative techniques by tech companies to foster compulsive use of their","date":"","full_text":"In today’s world, you’d have to be looking at your phone all the time not to notice that people are looking at their phones all the time.\nSome device owners are so enamored of their digital companions that even crossing a busy street doesn’t merit a little look-see at the 3-D world. Last year, when it came to playing Pokémon Go, driving a car or walking toward a cliff didn’t rate some people’s full attention, either.\nRecently, a former Google “design ethicist” named Tristan Harris has been on a crusade of sorts calling out tech companies like Facebook, Google and Apple for using behavioral techniques and neuroscience to keep you compulsively glued to your phone and computer screens.\nHarris’ campaign is starting to get a lot of media attention — last month, “60 Minutes” ran a segment looking at the issue. That was followed by the comedian and tele-muckraker Bill Maher making it the subject of one of his HBO commentaries.\n“The tycoons of social media have to stop pretending that they’re friendly nerd-gods building a better world, and admit they’re just tobacco farmers in t-shirts selling an addictive product to children,” Maher opined. “Because let’s face it, checking your ‘likes’ is the new smoking.”\n“Apple, Google, Facebook? They are essentially drug dealers.”\nHere’s Maher’s take (replete with his signature politically incorrect raunch):\nWhile the comedian’s view may seem over-the-top, KQED’s Lesley McClurg recently reported the story of a middle-school girl who became hooked on watching YouTube, before her parents sent her to to an actual addiction recovery clinic. The cost: $60,000, paid partly from their retirement accounts.\nIn reporting that story, McClurg interviewed Harris, the former Google ethicist. He called the practice of tech companies using scientific techniques that foster compulsivity “brain hacking.” Harris now runs a nonprofit called Time Well Spent, whose home page invites people to “reclaim our minds from being hijacked by technology.”\nSpeaking about the current power of Google, Facebook and Apple to command our collective gaze, Harris tells McClurg: “Never before in history have a handful of technology designers working at three tech companies … influenced how a billion people spend their attention.”\nHarris says that good, ethical design is being trumped by the quest for profit.\n“If your company’s goal and your stock price is based on how much attention they get from someone, it’s not really about ethics,” he says. “They just have to do whatever it takes to get attention.”\nAnd that has created an eyeballs-seeking arms race.\n“After you finish watching a YouTube video,” Harris notes, “it auto-plays the next one right away, so you don’t have to make a conscious choice. Let’s say that creates a 5 percent lift in how much time people spend on YouTube. So Facebook is sitting there watching their traffic get siphoned away, and Facebook says we have to make our videos auto-play, too.” (Neither Google nor Facebook returned a request for comment.)\nFacebook, meanwhile, has every incentive to keep you mousing through its news feed so it can sell more ads. Harris says that’s one reason the company uses continuous scroll, so that new content will keep opening up as you hit the bottom of the page. But he thinks a more ethical design would be to enable what an individual user wants to do at any given moment.\n“Let’s say your friend texts you that dinner’s off,” he says. “So there you are with no plans, and you open up Facebook. At that moment, Facebook has about 1,000 people whose job is to get you to just click and scroll and watch stuff on the news feed. And that will work. You’ll probably end up sitting there, an hour later, just kind of having scrolled through the news feed.”\nAt which point, says Harris, you will have fulfilled Facebook’s mission, but perhaps not your own.\nBut what if Facebook actually asked you what you wanted to do, apart from just using Facebook? Like perhaps finding other people who have no plans?\n“It’s about agency,” says Harris. “Facebook would have to have some way before you just get dropped in the newsfeed, to say, ‘What do you want right now?’\nB.J. Fogg runs the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford, which teaches students to use these sticky techniques. Many employees of top tech companies, including a cofounder of Instagram, have participated in the lab.\nFogg says he got to know some of the early Facebook employees, and found them genuinely motivated by a desire to do good.\n“The individual people at Facebook, the people that I met, really wanted to make the world more harmonious, bring people together, create empathy and so on,” he says.\n“Where I think Tristan (Harris) and I would agree a lot is that often their business goals can be at odds with the human-centered approach to design. There’s a conflict there between what they need to do as an advertising company and what’s going to be really good for people.”\nAmusing Ourselves to Death\nThe reason this matters so much is that technology is going to get more and more persuasive, says Harris.\n“We’re sitting at the very edge of what will become a virtual reality and augmented reality world. If those worlds are even more persuasive in getting us to spend our time there, where is human agency in that process?”\nAnd then a warning.\n“We have to have that conversation now because right now it’s driving toward not a good direction.”\nHe cited a 1985 book, “Amusing Ourselves to Death,” by Neil Postman, that distinguished between two dystopian visions.\n“There’s one that most people already know: the “1984” Big Brother, surveillance future. We have all been trained to look out for that.\n“But there is this subtler second vision of power, which was the Aldous Huxley vision in “Brave New World,” that’s so good at giving us amusement and little bits of trivia. In other words, it’s not that we shouldn’t be concerned about book burning, but we should be concerned about a society that distracts us from even wanting to read.”\nIt’s the Dopamine\nRamsay Brown is the co-founder of Dopamine Labs, which uses artificial intelligence and neuroscience to help app writers attract and retain users.\nDopamine Labs makes no bones about what it’s trying to do. From a promotional document on its website.:\nKeeping users engaged isn’t luck: it’s science. Give users the right of dopamine at the right moment and they’ll stay longer and use your app more.”\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with rewards and addictive substances. The company is not just being glib when it says it will deliver the chemical to users. Dr. Elias Aboujaoude, the director of Stanford’s Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Clinic, told KQED’s McClurg that dopamine and other feel-good brain chemicals spike in people who compulsively use the internet.\nBrown told me that social media companies use a concept known as variable rewards, something that slot machines use to hook gamblers, to similarly keep users clicking.\n“The brain isn’t particularly craving any one little feel-good signal as much as it does a really good rhythm and pattern,” Brown said. Both he and Harris say Facebook and Instagram tailor the timing of the “notifications” they deliver to users — the messages you get that are indicated by a number in red at the top right of the screen — in order to deliver shots of dopamine to users at times determined by an algorithm.\n“Sometimes there’s nothing waiting for you, sometimes there’s a friend request or someone wrote on your wall,” Brown told me. “Sometimes there’s just kind of like filler crap. It’s not pertinent to your life, but Facebook’s algorithms have figured out that showing it to you then is going to be slightly more surprising then not showing it to you at all or showing it to you later.”\nThese patterns will keep you coming back.\nI asked Brown how he knew that’s what Facebook was doing.\n“It’s obvious to anyone who knows the techniques,” he said.\nIn the “60 Minutes” segment, Larry Rosen, a professor of psychology at California State University, Dominguez Hills, who researches the psychology of tech, said typically, people check their phones every 15 minutes or less. They’re not just craving dopamine; he said they’re seeking relief from the stress hormone cortisol.\n“Half of the time, they check their phone, there’s no alert, no notification,” said Rosen. “It’s coming from inside their head, telling them, ‘Gee I haven’t checked on Facebook for a while, I haven’t checked on this Twitter feed for a while. I wonder if someone commented on my Instagram post. That then generates cortisol and it starts to make you anxious. Eventually your goal is to get rid of that anxiety, so you check in.”\nAs Anderson Cooper of “60 Minutes” put it: “Their research suggests our phones are keeping us in a continual state of anxiety in which the only antidote is the phone.”\nDoing Good\nRamsay Brown says his own company uses this type of research to help only businesses or organizations it has determined are trying to do good.\n“To break the habits we don’t want in ourselves or make the habits we do want in ourselves,” as he puts it.\nTo that end, Dopamine Labs created an app called “Space,” intended to help users break troublesome online habits by creating a delay before certain apps will open.\nApple initially denied the app for placement in its app store. Brown says he was told by an Apple rep that the rejection came because any app that encouraged people to use other apps less was inappropriate for the store. After the “60 Minutes” segment aired, Apple accepted the app. (An Apple spokesperson said the rejection had to do with a technical issue and that “The adjustment had nothing to do with whether the app discouraged people from using other apps or not.”)\nEven though Dopamine Labs might choose clients according to its own definition of doing good, I wondered if the application of techniques that are as powerful and potentially insidious as he and other researchers say they are is justified, no matter what the product.\n“We are in a bit of a Robert Oppenheimer moment,” Brown said, citing the scientist who is often called the father of the atomic bomb, and who later expressed a deep ambivalence about his work.\n“We have now developed a rigorous technology of the human mind, and that is both exciting and terrifying. We have the ability to twiddle some nobs in a machine learning dashboard we build, and around the world hundreds of thousands of people are going to quietly change their behavior in ways that, unbeknownst to them, feel second-nature but are really by design.”\n“Which means that there’s a deep ethical imperative for us to use it for good.”\nSo What’s the Harm?\nAs KQED’s McClurg reported, addictions to social media, video games, texting, shopping and pornography are not officially listed disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. A consensus is growing, however, that compulsive online behavior is doing real harm.\nHundreds of papers have been written on the negative consequences of using Facebook, alone. While some studies have also shown positive effects, Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University and the author of “Generation Me,” says more rigorous research has come to a more negative conclusion.\n“Its pretty clear these days that spending more time on social media leads to a more negative mood,” she said.\nTwenge says her research shows that the proliferation of the smartphone is having big effects on people born around 1995. She say that’s when the millennial generation morphs into “iGen” — also known as Generation Z.\nShe pointed to the plummeting employment rate of young men as one macro-development related to iGen, and cited the work of University of Chicago economist Erik Hurst. Last year, in a university profile, Hurst discussed his research on the dwindling percentage of young males without a college degree in the labor force and this trend’s connection to leisure-time technology:\nIn the 2000s, employment rates for this group dropped sharply – more than in any other group. We have determined that, in general, they are not going back to school or switching careers, so what are they doing with their time? The hours that they are not working have been replaced almost one for one with leisure time. Seventy-five percent of this new leisure time falls into one category: video games. The average low-skilled, unemployed man in this group plays video games an average of 12, and sometimes upwards of 30 hours per week. This change marks a relatively major shift that makes me question its effect on their attachment to the labor market.\nThe Attention Economy\nBJ Fogg says a lot of persuasion methods that Facebook and other tech companies use are not really new.\nHe gave the example of Facebook birthday reminders, which often draw people back into the site to wish someone happy birthday. “Reminders are not new,” he said, citing Hallmark TV commercials about mother’s day, for example. “What ‘s different today is that machines are being created to use these techniques.”\nAt this point, I am reminded that those of us who create text for public consumption have also been in the business of attention-grabbing for quite some time. This excerpt we recently posted from Tim Wu’s book “The Attention Merchants,” is instructive; it takes you through the evolution and eventual mainstream adoption of clickbait — those headlines that contain just the right words to whet your appetite for a click.\nWhile we here at KQED have yet to hire a an actual neuroscientist to help us craft the perfect syntactic arrangement to make our post on the California brown pelican count irresistible to a mass audience, we have sat through any number of workshops led by self-styled audience-whisperers. And we do use software tools to try to figure out what works and what doesn’t in terms of getting people to read an article.\nIsn’t that, crudely, some form of brain hacking?\nThe point being: Everyone is in quest of your eyeballs. The question is how far will people go to get them. Where the line gets crossed from superior business model to dirty rotten trick is the subject of much debate, from the halls of government to academia to Thanksgiving brouhahas.\nOn the “60 Minutes” segment, Gabe Zichermann, who consults for companies on how to use “gamification” to make their digital products more appealing, argued that attracting audience is simply the name of the game.\n“Asking technology companies, asking content creators to be less good at what they do feels like a ridiculous ask,” he said. “It feels impossible. And also it’s very anti-capitalistic. This isn’t the system that we live in.”\nThe other side of that, expressed by Bill Maher in his televised rant:\n“The moral rot in this country began when corporate America decided it wasn’t enough to just successfully sell your product; people needed to be addicted to it.”\nMeantime, while you wait for society to figure this issue out, it’s probably best to take matters into your own compulsively typing hands.

Later, she suggested that it would be up to states to figure out how to hold private schools accountable for the millions of public dollars they would receive under the Trump administration's proposed budget.\nIn their sprightly exchange, Pocan, who supports public schools, and DeVos, a longtime advocate of private schools, managed to do something remarkable: Explain the entire history and controversy over school vouchers in Wisconsin in under six minutes.\nHere are some highlights from the house subcommittee meeting, plus a few fact checks:\nPocan asks DeVos if she would send her children to a Milwaukee voucher school called Right Step, Inc. He quotes data reported in the Journal Sentinel that 7% of students were proficient in English and 0% were proficient in math. But that's an old story. The school's academic record now is worse: Just 2% of Right Step students were proficient in math and no students were proficient in English on the 2015-'16 state tests.\nInstead of answering the question, DeVos reminds Pocan that the late Polly Williams, a Democratic lawmaker, was the first to introduce the Milwaukee voucher program.\nPocan points out that Williams, before she died, said the program had not lived up to its promise.\nThey're both right.\n\"This is tax policy, not education policy,\" Pocan says, alluding to how more middle-class parents in Wisconsin are accessing vouchers.\nDeVos: \"I really applaud Milwaukee for empowering parents to make the decisions that they think are right for their students and their children.\"\nPocan cuts her off in the middle of the next sentence, saying the Milwaukee program has had dismal results. Pocan continues to talk over DeVos until the committee chairman asks him to let DeVos answer his question.\nPocan wants to know about accountability for the private schools that would get more federal dollars. DeVos says that will be left up to states, under the plans they create to implement the Every Student Succeeds Act. *But in reality, no states would propose voucher-school accountability standards in their ESSA plans, because federal education law only applies to public schools, and all voucher schools are private schools (and usually religious).\nThe Trump administration's budget proposal would offer an additional $1.4 billion for school choice, including $250 million for private and religious schools, $168 million for charter schools and $1 billion for school districts to adopt systems that allow public dollars to follow students to whatever schools their parents select.\n*This story was modified after it was posted to clarify that accountability requirements under ESSA do not apply to private schools.\nContact Erin Richards at (414) 224-2705 or erin.richards@jrn.com or @emrichards on Twitter."},{"url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/former-naacp-president-benjamin-jealous-expected-to-announce-run-for-maryland-governor-this-week/2017/05/29/a50dc73e-44a1-11e7-98cd-af64b4fe2dfc_story.html","title":"Former NAACP president Benjamin Jealous expected to announce run for Maryland governor this week","author_text":"https://www.facebook.com/ovetta.wiggins","keywords":["Ben Jealous","Ben Jealous For Governor","Ben Jealous Running For Governor","Former Naacp President Ben Jealous","Benjamin Jealous Running For Governor","Maryland Gov.

Bernie Sanders (Vt.) during his 2016 presidential campaign, is expected to formally declare his candidacy for Maryland governor this week, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plans.\nJealous, who has made a name for himself in recent years as a voice for liberal Democratic groups, has been widely expected to enter the race. But over the weekend, members of Our Revolution, the political nonprofit that grew out of Sanders’s failed presidential campaign, received emails inviting them to an announcement on Wednesday touted as “Ben’s Big Day.”\nA spokesman for Jealous declined to comment about the event.\nBut the person with knowledge of the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak for the campaign, said the announcement is scheduled for Wednesday in Baltimore.\nA former journalist and community organizer, Jealous would offer a stark contrast to Gov. Larry Hogan, a moderate Republican with sky-high approval ratings in a blue state, and the other Democrats who have expressed interest in a 2018 bid for governor.\nHe is expected to be one of the more progressive candidates in what probably will be a crowded field of Democrats.\nHe is a strong proponent of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour; ending mass incarceration; making higher education affordable, including providing free tuition to community colleges; and providing affordable, high quality health care to residents and tax credits to growing small businesses.\nJealous, who has never held elected office, would be the second Democrat to officially enter the race. Alec Ross, a technology entrepreneur, announced his candidacy last month. State Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr. (Montgomery) said this month that he plans to seek the Democratic nomination, but he has not officially declared.\nOther Democrats considering a bid include Prince George’s County Executive Rushern L. Baker III, former Maryland attorney general Douglas F. Gansler, Baltimore County Executive Kevin B. Kamenetz and lawyer James L. Shea.\nMany say Jealous, who has been talking to voters across the state over the past three months, has brought a new level of energy to the party, which is still reeling from then-Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown’s (D) loss to Hogan in 2014.\nJealous has not only piqued the interest of several state delegates, who have said they would probably endorse him, but he has also won support from progressives across the state and the country.\n“I’m not of the party establishment,” Jealous said during a recent interview. “My career has been working in the community with real people, where they live on their own terms to identify and achieve solutions and solve real problems in real time. It is that background as community organizer and president of the NAACP that guides my sense of what’s possible, that fuels this campaign. I know we can pull people together into big, robust and sometimes precarious coalitions to get things done in this democracy we call Maryland.”\nDemocracy for America, a national progressive group, endorsed Jealous earlier this month, even without a formal declaration of his candidacy.\nCharles Chamberlain, the executive director of the organization, said members of the group, which was founded by former Vermont governor and Democratic presidential hopeful Howard Dean, have been “fired up” about a possible Jealous candidacy since February, when word spread that he was seriously considering a run.\nThe 44-year-old Baltimore resident was an early supporter of Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign and treasurer of Our Revolution, which aims to continue Sanders’s political movement by backing progressive candidates.\nJealous is a partner at Kapor Capital, a California-based venture capital investment firm that focuses on socially conscious businesses.\nJealous has said he considered, but decided against, running for U.S. Senate in 2015 after former senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D) announced her retirement.\nFor his gubernatorial run, Jealous is likely to get support from Our Revolution and other national progressive groups.\nJealous previously said he started weighing a gubernatorial run after Sanders ended his presidential campaign, and received even more encouragement after offering a vigorous endorsement of Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention.\nThe election of President Trump, Jealous said, further inspired him to seek office.\nWith his background leading one of the nation’s largest and most storied civil rights groups, Jealous may also have an advantage with African American voters who have made up more than a third of Democratic primary electorates.\nBut he and Baker could also end up splitting the black vote. Maryland has never elected a black governor."},{"url":"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/05/marijuana-growers-sow-displacement-fears-in-denver/527598","title":"It's 'Ganjapreneurs' Against Artists in Denver","author_text":"Joe Eaton","keywords":[],"publication_text":"CityLab","description":"The city’s cultural community supported the movement to legalize recreational cannabis—but now artists are competing with “ganjapreneurs” for cheap industrial space.","date":"","full_text":"Mark Sink, a fine art photographer, moved home to Denver from New York City in 1991. He bought his two-story brick house in the city’s urban Lower Highland neighborhood for $50,000, with the help of owner financing. More than two decades later, houses like his in the now-trendy LoHi neighborhood go for upwards of $1 million, and Sink often finds developer business cards in his mailbox asking if he’s willing to sell.\n“First come the artists. Then come the developers. Then it’s all over for everyone,” says Sink, who co-founded the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver.\nThat has long been a familiar lament in American cities, but Denver’s gentrification narrative has an herbal twist: Since 2014, when recreational marijuana became legal in the state, the arts community and other residents who rely on low rents have been feeling the economic pressure from marijuana entrepreneurs—known locally as ganjapreneurs—who are often after the same cheap spaces to sell and grow weed.\nThere’s an irony to this, as Sink notes. Lots of artists were big supporters of the 2012 ballot referendum that led to legalization. “Who knew marijuana would be one of the strong forces keeping us out of affordable spaces?” Sink says.\nThe impact of legalized marijuana on rising real estate values is difficult to quantify. Rents were rising around here before legalization, thanks in part to rapid population growth. According to the online real estate database company Zillow, Denver renters spent around 30 percent of their income on rent between 1980 and 2000. By the end of 2014, they spent more than 38 percent. Over the past decade, the region has been enjoying an economic renaissance, with large gains in industries ranging from high tech to mineral extraction. Many once-affordable neighborhoods bear the tell-tale signs of the boom: a proliferation of urban condos, yoga studios, and branded luxury. Hang around town for a day and you’ll hear the refrain from gas station cashiers and politicians about how Denver gains 1,000 citizens a month. From 2004 to 2014, the city gained more than 430,000 residents.\nSome have come for the jobs, others the lifestyle. And some have come simply for the weed.\nSince legalization, the state has awarded more than 300 licenses for Denver-based grow operations. Many of those growers leased or bought industrial warehouses, driving up their values—and driving artists out of the low-rent spaces they once occupied. Artists who crave the raw square-footage and affordability of warehouse space for their studios have found that the same real estate also fits the needs of cannabis growers. Dustin Whistler, a broker and founder of Forte Commercial Real Estate, says rents for industrial spaces have risen 40 percent since 2012. Spaces that before legalization were all but unrentable are now going for $10 to $12 a square foot, he says.\nThe displacement pressure related to the marijuana boom is impacting all manner of Denverites, not just artists. Analysis by the Denver Post found that the industry is clustered heavily in low-income neighborhoods along Denver’s I-70 and I-25 corridors, a mix of residential and light industrial areas that are also home to much of the metro’s Latino community. These industrial areas are also where artists have traditionally found inexpensive spaces to live and work.\nLauri Lynnxe Murphy, an artist and curator, has been working from a rehabbed garage near the River North Art District for 10 years. Her landlord has been good to her, but she knows her days in her studio are limited. She expects to lose her lease any day. Likely, it will push her out of Denver. “You can’t deny there are a good things and bad things that have come from legalization,” Murphy says. “But you can’t say it hasn’t caused a lot of pain.”\nLegalization has boosted a strong tourism market and helped fill tax coffers. According to the Marijuana Policy Group, a Denver-based market research firm, legal marijuana sales generated $2.4 billion in economic impact in 2015. It brought 18,000 jobs and $121 million in combined sales and excise tax revenues. Adam Orens, a partner of the group, said he expects the 2016 numbers to be larger. Marijuana is a Colorado growth industry, he says, and that will likely continue, although the state may face competition if other states legalize recreational marijuana.\nBut Orens also says the industry is given too much credit—and takes too much blame—for the economic changes in the city and the state. He thinks the rising cost of living here is a market adjustment; modern Denver now has more in common with high-cost coastal cities like San Francisco or Boston than other metros in the Mountain West. “In 2014, marijuana legalization was a national curiosity; it was the reason a lot of people came to Colorado,” he says. “Now it’s just another amenity, like brew pubs, the Colorado Rockies, and skiing.”\nCheap rent, however, is no longer one of those amenities, and that has some local artists worried about the longer-term fate of the city’s cultural scene. In December, the city shut down Rhinoceropolis, a popular underground venue and heart of Denver’s vibrant DIY culture, over fire code violations—part of a wave of such closures that swept the country after the Ghost Ship fire in Oakland that killed 36 people. But the artists who lived and worked there say the 11-year-old venue was targeted as part of the transformation of the city’s River North Arts District. “The city is basically sweeping us out of the places that we create and treating us in a similar way they treat homeless people,” says Stephan Herrera, an artist who has lived at both Rhinoceropolis and the venue’s sister space Glob, which are not zoned residential.Herrera doesn’t blame legal marijuana. But without the warehouses to relocate to, he says the DIY arts community has been dispersed, which makes it harder for younger artists trying to break in to the scene.\nIt’s a topic of particular interest to Chandler Romeo and her husband Reed Wiemer, who own most of the buildings in the Navajo Street Art District in Northwest Denver. The couple, both artists, moved to Denver in 1980 and bought their first building a few years later. Over the years, they added four more, started an art co-op that became the Zip 37 gallery, and rented cut-rate space to galleries. Among them is Pirate: Contemporary Art, one of Denver’s oldest. “We became old crappy building collectors,” Romeo says, buying boarded-up buildings that no one wanted.\nTheir real estate holdings made Romeo and Chandler rich, on paper. But rising taxes, insurance and maintenance costs were bleeding the couple’s finances. Romeo and Chandler say they were forced to significantly raise rents in their buildings. Pirate and two other galleries have since left the Navajo Street Art District, and the couple say new tenants, including a nonprofit coffee shop, will move in. The couple says the artists understand, and they haven’t lost friends. “We were really concerned about that. It is our peer group,” Romeo says.\nThe city and cultural groups are floating several proposals to help artists find affordable places to work and live in Denver. One proposed development includes 90 spaces for low-income artists in the River North Art District. But Mark Sink, for one, is suspicious that artists can thrive on these sort of official handouts; he feels that the city and developers are selling the artistic history of neighborhoods to promote the condo-heavy development that is changing the face of the neighborhoods. “It’s just a big front,” he says. “At $30 a square foot you are an arts district? Yeah, sure.”\nFor his part, Sink has recently purchased a small building outside the city that has been boarded up since 1980. He is not optimistic about the future of the city’s cultural scene.\n“In 20 years, it will be, ‘What happened? Where are all the cool people?’”"},{"url":"https://theconversation.com/heres-how-witnessing-violence-harms-childrens-mental-health-53321","title":"Here's how witnessing violence harms children’s mental health","author_text":"Daniel J. Flannery","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Conversation","description":"Children are increasingly being exposed to more violence. The impact? They could get desensitized to violence and come to believe that it is an acceptable way to solve problems.","date":"","full_text":"Caroline was having a hard time getting her daughter to go to school. The night before, her daughter saw the news about a terrorist bombing that had occurred that day where several children and adults were killed and schools were immediately closed.\nHer daughter had a difficult time sleeping and was refusing to eat her breakfast. When Caroline asked her daughter what was wrong, she replied in a hushed tone,\n“I’m scared mommy. If I go to school, will somebody come in and shoot me? I don’t want to die.”\nThough Caroline was reacting to news here in the United States, she could just as easily have been reacting to the recent bombing at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England – and its coverage in the media. Both underscore children’s constant exposure to troubling events and depictions of violence throughout the world.\nAs researchers and clinicians who have studied the problem of violence over the past three decades, we have witnessed a steady increase in levels of children’s exposure to violence and its damaging effect on their mental health.\nHow does this exposure to violence affect children and adolescents – especially their mental health? And how should we handle the increased fear and insecurity that results from such events?\nExposure to violence\nToday, children use many different forms of media and at unprecedented levels – 92 percent of teens go online daily and 24 percent are online constantly. As a result, children get exposed to violence through multiple media. So, even when violence happens in another part of the world, children are exposed to the event and its consequences immediately, intensely and repeatedly as a result of media exposure.\nAnd there is increasing evidence that exposure to violence in everyday life has a significant impact on children’s mental health.\nBut then, children today are growing up in a world where fear and insecurity rule over confidence and safety. This is not just driven by media but also by what they experience in the real world.\nSo, in addition to terrorist acts, children could witness or be victims of violence in many other ways. For example, when we surveyed high school students, between 13 and 45 percent reported they had been beaten up at school. Between 23 and 82 percent said they had witnessed someone else being beaten up at school in the past year.\nWe have also seen how school shootings with multiple victims have increased in prevalence in the past five years.\nHere is what happens to children\nChildren who report high levels of exposure to violence (either as witness or victim) report the highest levels of depression, anger and anxiety.\nOur study with children in grades three to eight who witnessed someone being hit, slapped, or punched found that 12 percent of these children reported levels of anxiety that could require treatment.\nSimilarly, six months after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, a survey of over 8,000 New York City students in grades four through 12 showed that nearly 30 percent of children reported symptoms of anxiety or depression.\nExposure to violence could have other long-term impacts as well: children could get desensitized to violence and its effects. Studies have shown how children can get desensitized to violence: that is, children can come to believe that violence is an acceptable way to solve problems and that it is without consequence. They could also come to believe that violence could happen anywhere and to anyone at any time.\nFurther, such children are also at a risk of perpetrating violence against others.\nOur studies have shown that children who witness or are victimized by violence are more aggressive toward others. These children also show problematic levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms.\nWe have consistently found relationships between violence exposure and trauma symptoms, whether we surveyed children in schools, youth in the community or juveniles who were receiving treatment as a result of diversion from the prison system.\nAdolescents exposed to high levels of violence reported higher levels of anger and depression. They also reported higher rates of wanting to hurt or kill themselves compared to adolescents in lower violence exposure groups.\nMedia exposure\nMore recent studies have confirmed that high exposure to television violence for children and adolescents is also associated with higher levels of aggression and violent behavior. Exposure to violence shown through media is consistently associated with problem behaviors, such as increases in aggression and anxiety. Children could also end up with lower empathy and compassion for others.\nSome children exposed to various forms of media violence (not just television violence but violence on the Internet, in movies and in video games) can come to view the world as a mean, scary place where they are not safe and they can do little to protect themselves from harm. This is a particular problem for very young children such as those under the age of six who have difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy.\nExposure to violence could harm the emotional and mental development of young children and adolescents. Children at that age aren’t able to effectively process what they are seeing and hearing. This may be due in part to the fact that chronic exposure to violence can affect parts of their brain.\nFor adolescents, the front part of their brains is the last to develop and mature. This part of the brain is called the prefrontal cortex, and it is responsible for processing information, impulse control and reasoning. Adolescents exposed to violent video games experience a decrease in activity in their prefrontal cortex, leaving them more vulnerable to having difficulty with problem-solving and controlling their emotions.\nWhat can parents do?\nParents have an important role to play. Knowing where their children are, what they are doing and with whom are some of the best ways to help support children. That improves their ability to cope with what is going on in the world around them.\nThe same is true for adolescents as well. It is sometimes assumed that as children reach adolescence, they need less support and monitoring as they spend more time with their peers and make increased demands to be more independent.\nThat is not the case.\nAdolescents have more access to social media, to drugs and alcohol, and to transportation. Coupled with this is the growing evidence that the problem-solving and impulse control parts of their brains are not yet fully developed.\nParents are often the first to recognize their children are struggling with mental health and behavioral issues. And they could be the best providers of mental health first aid whenever and however their children need them.\nThe immediacy, intensity and imagery of the coverage of the concert bombing in Manchester may be very disturbing to both youth and adults. It is important that we continue to discuss this with our children and help them express their emotions and viewpoints, while assuring them that these extreme acts of violence, while deeply disturbing, are the exception and not the rule.\nEditor’s note: The above was written in response to children in the United States witnessing coverage of school shootings.

A new task force hopes to find new tenants that, if picked properly, could become anchors in their new neighborhoods.","date":"","full_text":"At the end of last year, Dominick’s, the popular Chicago grocery chain, closed 57 stores across the metro region. Not only did roughly 6,000 people lose their jobs, but many Chicagoans lost easy access to fresh produce and groceries. Mayor Rahm Emanuel formed a task force to find new tenants for the vacant stores in early December, after Dominick’s parent company, Safeway Inc., announced that it would be closing its Chicago stores.\nFrom the outset, it’s worth mentioning that not all 57 of the shuttered stores are in Chicago proper. Fifteen were within city limits, six of which have been taken over by other chains. But that leaves nine vacant neighborhood grocery stores, from the city’s South Side to the West Loop.\nDominick’s has a long history dating back to 1918 and dominated the Chicago area for years, boasting a peak of 130 stores in the late 1990s. But with the emergence of Trader Joe’s and chains like Mariano’s, Dominick’s lost its share of the market and fled the city.\nSo Emanuel has assembled 20 leaders and lawmakers, helmed by Deputy Mayor Steve Koch, to handle the fallout.\n“The task force’s number-one priority is to get these buildings filled as quickly as possible with grocers or other businesses that nearby residents can continue to depend upon for daily needs, services and jobs,” Emanuel said in a press release last week.\nIn the wake of the closings, Whole Foods mailed fliers offering discounts to Dominick’s customers, according to the Chicago Sun Times. That’s a nice offering from the Austin organic behemoth, but it won’t bring fresh food back to affected neighborhoods and it certainly won’t recreate 6,000 jobs.\nIn the meantime, the task force is recruiting both local and national grocers for the nine empty storefronts.\n“We’re currently targeting about a dozen local and national grocers, each of which has the capacity to expand into one or more of these locations,” Andrew J. Mooney, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Planning and Development and a member of the task force, said in a release. “We’re making sure they recognize the buying power that’s represented, what public resources are available and how their investment would cater to the needs of area customers.”\nThere’s clearly a lot of risk, even for a chain with deep pockets, to move into the Chicago market. But as we wrote here just on Tuesday, a grocery store can anchor a neighborhood. It took eight years for Circle Foods, in New Orleans’ Seventh Ward, to reopen after Hurricane Katrina. After years of failed financing efforts, it opened its doors again last Friday, the result of smart policy and public-private partnerships.\nCircle Foods was an $8 million renovation because of hurricane damage. Chicago has nine stores, all of which are presumably move-in ready, across neighborhoods where some residents are reeling from the loss of their trusted grocer. If the task force finds the right tenants, whether they’re local or national — Whole Foods has done an admirable job of food education in Detroit — it could pay dividends for residents in the form of both produce and job opportunities.\nBill Bradley is a writer and reporter living in Brooklyn.

Other insurers heavily invested in the Obamacare markets, like the regional Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, are urging Congress to fix the 2010 health law instead of shredding it. And then there’s Anthem, a rare industry voice supporting repeal.\nThe result is the lobby has lost influence and is now struggling to mount a unified front against Republican efforts to push through an Obamacare replacement. At the same time, the Trump administration has ignored their pleas to stabilize Obamacare’s exchanges in the short term, which could send the wobbly insurance marketplaces crashing before the GOP agrees on a health care plan.\n“I’m still hoping they’ll step forward more aggressively and articulate how horrendous this plan is,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), whose home state is the headquarters for several health insurance giants. “They know full well what the impact will be.”\nRep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas), who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee’s health subcommittee, said officials from the main industry lobby, America’s Health Insurance Plans, never reached out to him while the House drafted an Obamacare replacement bill.\n“I may have had one meeting in January [with] an insurer in my state,” Burgess said. “Otherwise I have not been contacted.”\nAHIP officials and allies push back strongly against suggestions that the organization has been weakened. They argue that AHIP has picked its battles carefully, enabling the lobbying group to maintain communication with the Trump administration and lawmakers.\n“There’s a time to be in the fray, and there’s a time to be above the fray and to provide nuanced counsel to the policy makers,” said Mark Ganz, CEO of Cambia Health Solutions and the immediate past board chair of AHIP. “I’ve been a voice that we need to be thoughtful and nuanced and not add to the noise.”\nInsurers were at the center of the last two major health care brawls. They torpedoed the Clinton health plan of the early 1990s with a devastating $20 million ad campaign, including the now-legendary “Harry and Louise” commercials. Eight years ago, insurers begrudgingly went along with Obamacare when reform seemed inevitable.\nBut the health insurance lobby has fewer resources after losing some large companies as members. AHIP has also seen a wholesale turnover of senior leadership following the departure of its longtime CEO Karen Ignagni two years ago. That upheaval has been made tougher by the diverging interests among its remaining members.\n“What insurers ought to recognize is that the bill is a disaster for them because it’s a disaster for their customers,” said Tom Epstein, who until recently headed public affairs at Blue Shield of California. “It’s a difficult predicament, but I think they need to take a stronger stand.”\nAHIP’s decision in 2015 to hire former Obama health official Marilyn Tavenner as CEO was seen as a coup at the time, given her central role in implementing Obamacare and her solid relationships with Republican lawmakers.\n“She’s got a very long and storied history of looking at the health care system from a lot of different angles,” AHIP spokeswoman Kristine Grow said.\nHowever, the GOP’s full takeover of the federal government last November has made the decision to hire someone so closely identified with Obamacare look like less of a triumph.\nGrow pointed to recent AHIP meetings with HHS Secretary Tom Price and CMS Administrator Seema Verma as evidence of the lobby’s efforts to shape the GOP health plan.\n“AHIP always has a seat at the table,” Grow said. “While people continue to be frustrated with the nuance of our messaging, we’re representing the interests of our members.”\nInsurers generally have two major problems with the repeal bill that passed the House in May. They think its tax credits to help low-income Americans purchase coverage are too stingy, and they’re worried about its $834 billion cut to Medicaid — a program that’s been increasingly lucrative for them.\nBut insurers also aren’t happy with the status quo. They’ve lost billions of dollars on their Obamacare customers — $7.9 billion in 2015 alone, according to McKinsey — and some of the biggest plans have abandoned the marketplaces.\nDespite widespread misgivings about the repeal effort, the industry has largely held its fire. House Republicans showed little interest in engaging with the health care industry as they pushed through their repeal bill, but the Senate may be more receptive. Last week, AHIP sent a detailed letter to Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) laying out its concerns with the House bill, which the Senate is expected to rewrite.\nSome insurers have come out aggressively against key pieces of the House's repeal plan in recent days. UnitedHealth wrote a letter to Hatch this week arguing that Obamacare's Medicaid expansion should be preserved. And the CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts penned an op-ed warning against weakening protections for individuals with costly medical conditions.\nBut insurers have mostly focused on trying to get the Trump administration to continue a key Obamacare subsidy program that’s being challenged in court. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut off that funding, which most insurance experts believe would trigger an implosion of the struggling Obamacare markets. The fate of the subsidies, worth about $7 billion per year, remains in limbo after the Trump administration recently asked a federal court for another 90 days to consider how to proceed.\nInsurers are “caught in this debate right now,” said Chris Jennings, a veteran Democratic health policy expert. “They find themselves in a little bit of no-man’s land.”\nThe industry stood by Obamacare for years through court challenges and the rocky HealthCare.gov rollout. But the fragmented industry started to come apart two years ago, shortly after Ignagni left AHIP. Since then, two of the five largest national insurers — UnitedHealth Group and Aetna — left the group, as did WellCare, one of the country’s largest Medicaid plans.\nThose defections were a blow to the association’s muscle. As other health care industries ramped up lobbying in the first quarter of this year, AHIP scaled back. The organization spent $1.7 million in the quarter, well behind the $2.2 million it spent the same time last year.\n“I don’t know what these companies think they gain by going solo,” Epstein said. “The stakes are very high and the only way the industry can be effective is to speak with one voice.”\nDepartures within AHIP have also turned heads on Capitol Hill. Its former senior vice president for federal affairs, Jeremy Allen, a former GOP House staffer, left in March. Then another top federal affairs staffer, Courtney Lawrence, left to join HHS. In addition, four executive vice presidents and the group’s top attorney have left since Ignagni’s 2015 departure — perhaps not surprising given her long tenure.\n“Virtually the entire team involved in advocacy has turned over,” said one industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It’s hard to play a game at this level when the team is just getting to know each other.”\nTavenner, the AHIP CEO, faces a daunting task in placating the various interests within the organization, said Mario Molina, a former insurance CEO who’s been critical of the GOP’s repeal effort.\n“She’s very, very knowledgeable. She’s knows what to say and what to do,” said Molina, who this month was fired from the insurance company he ran for over 20 years. “But she’s operating with one hand tied behind her back because she doesn’t have the full support of her board.”\nAHIP has beefed up its Republican ties since the election. It hired David Merritt, who worked for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump confidante; Adrienne Morrell, a former top lobbyist for Health Net; and Matt Eyles, who’s worked for health insurers and pharma. It also hired a public affairs shop, Firehouse Strategies, staffed by veterans of Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign.\nBut there’s still a perception on Capitol Hill that the lobbying powerhouse has lost some of its muscle at a crucial time for the health insurance industry.\n“They’re afraid of alienating Republicans that they think control their fate over the next four years,” Epstein said."},{"url":"https://www.devex.com/news/aid-divisions-emerge-as-uk-election-looms-90422","title":"Aid divisions emerge as UK election looms","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Devex","description":"The United Kingdom’s development community is speculating about the future of aid ahead of a snap election this week, with key questions surrounding aid rules, the impact of Brexit and effective defense of aid spending.","date":"2017-06-05","full_text":"Read Devex’s post-election coverage: UK aid prospects brighten slightly in immediate election aftermath\nThe United Kingdom’s development community is speculating about the future of aid ahead of a snap election this week, with key questions surrounding aid rules, the impact of Brexit and effective defense of aid spending.\nPoliticians came together last week to discuss the community’s most salient concerns during a debate hosted by the Overseas Development Institute and Bond, the U.K. NGO network. Those concerns include a potential break with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s aid rules — proposed by the Conservative Party — and the effectiveness of private contractors.\nSee more related topics:\nIn addition, as the country grappled with its third terror attack in three months this weekend, politicians seem keen to frame aid as a potential deterrent of extremism at home and abroad, bolstering the Conservatives’ case for more security-related aid spending.\nThe Conservative Party now leads by only four percentage points, according to the latest YouGov poll, throwing into doubt the landslide victory expected when Prime Minister Theresa May called for the election in April. Labour, the leftist opposition party, is closing the gap, with only a few days left until the vote on June 8.\nWith the unpredictability of recent votes, many in the sector are daring to picture a change in leadership at the Department for International Development, currently headed by Secretary of State Priti Patel. This may be the case even without a change in government, as Conservative Member of Parliament Andrew Mitchell — who has previously held Patel’s job — seems to be repositioning himself in the public eye, ahead of a possible Cabinet reshuffle.\n“I think we’re going to politically be on a different planet after June 9, and it remains to be seen who will be Secretary of State for International Development,” Baroness Shas Sheehan, a member of the House of Lords and international development spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, a centrist party, told Devex. “I expect Andrew is lobbying hard.”\nAid worth defending\n“It’s an extraordinary thing that Britain’s leadership ... in elevating the social condition of people living in desperate poverty around the world is lauded and respected everywhere except in parts of Britain.”\nPoliticians from across the political spectrum defended Britain’s aid budget at last week’s debate. The country is one of just six currently reaching the United Nations’ recommended level of aid spending, at 0.7 percent of gross national income — a figure that both main parties have committed themselves to in their election manifestos.\nHowever, they also pointed to varying public attitudes towards aid, and the difficulties this can present in defending the budget.\n“It’s an extraordinary thing that Britain’s leadership and involvement and engagement in elevating the social condition of people living in desperate poverty around the world is lauded and respected everywhere except in parts of Britain,” said Mitchell. “I think we need to do a lot better.”\nHe referred to the controversy surrounding Yegna, an Ethiopian pop group promoting women’s rights and family planning which lost its DfID funding in late 2016, after a campaign against it by the British tabloid press. The campaign suggested the project was a waste of aid money — despite it having demonstrated significant impact.\nMitchell described the campaign and the decision to cut the program as “an absolute and total disgrace. This was a private sector project, which the British taxpayer supported on the basis that we were ... getting a great deal more bang for our buck by supporting it. It was a tragedy — it should’ve been much more defended,” he said.\nHis comments were interpreted by many at the event as a jab at the current DfID leadership. Yet Mitchell offered few solutions for resolving U.K. aid’s public relations problem. During his time at DfID, he cut domestic education programs aimed at teaching people about aid. Asked whether he might consider reinstating them, he replied that “the development budget is meant to be [used on] educating the poorest people in the world and not on education in Britain, so I do not think it’s a good use of development spending.”\nOnly representatives of the Labour Party pointed to the Sustainable Development Goals as a potential route for better demonstrating aid effectiveness. Lord Ray Collins, the Labour spokesperson on international development, said he was “disappointed that the government has not done enough to bring the SDGs into the debate in parliament about how we evaluate the effectiveness of aid.” He added that he believes such alignment would allow practitioners to more tangibly grapple with the “leave no one behind” policy.\nSecurity and the OECD aid rules\nWhile committing to the 0.7 percent benchmark, the Conservative manifesto also sets out plans to change the rules for ODA spending established by the OECD. But aid organizations worry that changes to the rules around security and military coordination in fragile contexts could result in a loss of aid accountability, and leave the aid budget vulnerable to raids by other government departments.\nA new report by the Donor Tracker identified three clear ways the refugee crisis is impacting donors' decisions around ODA spending. SEEK Development's Sabine Campe and Raimund Zühr explain.\nIn a joint statement, U.K. NGO leaders said that: “Keeping this promise [of focusing on the world’s poorest] is the right thing to do. It reflects the values of the millions of people around the U.K. who support our organisations and those of a bigger Britain of which we can all be proud.”\n“The OECD rules exist to ensure that this is the case and any changes risk a dangerous dilution of their impact,” they added.\nMitchell offered some clarification of how the Conservatives would go about changing the rules, and to what extent the changes could impact the way aid is spent by donors.\n“There’s a very tight definition of what conflict resolution expenditure is eligible under the 0.7 [percent] and what is not, and I think that definition needs to be tweaked,” he said. Mitchell used the example of British military intervention in Sierra Leone in 2000, and France’s intervention in Mali in 2012, when armed troops stymied emerging conflicts — something Mitchell says should have been paid for, at least in part, from the aid budget. He has also argued that some of the military expenditure in Afghanistan could have been shared between aid and military budgets.\n“My advice to my many friends in the development world is, rather than say[ing] no to what is a Tory commitment to renegotiate an aspect of these rules with the OECD, we should get involved in seeing if we can improve them,” he said.\nThe rules — which were already tweaked in February 2016 at the encouragement of the U.K. government — currently allow some flexibility for spending ODA on security and military engagement, as well as costs related to violent extremism. As they stand, the rules prohibit any use of ODA for financing military equipment or services, or “as a vehicle to promote providers’ security interests,” according to a communique from the development assistance committee.\nBut both Mitchell and, more hesitantly, Labour’s Lord Collins, made the case for further adjustments to the rules.\n“If the development community draws a line in the sand and says ‘no change to the OECD rules,’ I think that would be a tragedy because then I think the system could break,” Mitchell said. “We have to get involved in working out: What is a genuinely incremental development action which the military may take, and which should come in part from the development budget? I think that’s a good debate. There are some very brilliant people in the development world who will be able to engage in that debate and make sure we get it right,” he said.\nStill, Mitchell softened slightly the Conservative manifesto commitment to scrap the rules if the DAC refuses to agree, and stressed that even if the government tried to abandon the rules, “that will be a matter for parliament to decide.”\nCollins said that “at the moment, I’m totally committed to the rules as they are” but agreed that further changes to the DAC rules could be a good idea, on the grounds that “without peace and security you can’t have development.”\nHowever, Baroness Sheehan of the Liberal Democrats suggested that changing the rules could dilute the accountability of existing mechanisms for cross-sector security spending, namely the Prosperity Fund and the Conflict, Security and Stability Fund.\n“These different pots of money are not easily traceable,” she told Devex. “I can’t find out how the money’s being spent, if it’s being spent at all. And that’s the second danger: I think the foreign office and the [ministry of defence] will be in paralysis because at the moment they have to go through ODA rules,” she said. Sheehan claimed that these departments aren’t as adept as DfID at complying with ODA rules and that they “just don’t have the expertise or the personnel.”\nAs a result, “I think that money will just be siphoned off to the two other departments,” she said.\nBut both the main parties point to this type of spending as critical for countering extremism abroad, as well as for preventing acts of terror domestically.\nPrivate sector controversy\nThe role of the private sector in U.K. aid was another key subject of discussion. While some parties agreed with the current government’s “crackdown” on contractors — lately seen as a drain on the transparency of U.K. aid following alleged misconduct by one of its major contractors, Adam Smith International — Mitchell stood up for private sector firms, criticizing the agency for letting them “hang in the wind” in the face of negative press attention. “I think that actually the contractors have had a pretty raw deal,” he said.\nWhile there may have been failings, Mitchell said that the government or development community should defend contractors against aggressive press attention if they have won a competitive bidding process as the best value for money for taxpayers.\nHe added that whether or not a project is successful, DfID must be ready to either “take the plaudits” or to “put hands up” when things have gone wrong.\nBy contrast, the Liberal Democrats advocated for more scrutiny of private sector contractors, while Labour’s Lord Collins said the party would “absolutely” support contractors — on the condition of proper monitoring.\n“I think one of the biggest concerns that we have is the capacity of the department ... to actually maintain and monitor and properly evaluate impact,” he said. “Scrutiny from ICAI [an independent commission tasked with scrutinizing aid spending] is absolutely vital across the board, but we are now in this situation where we have external consultants monitoring private contractors, and that cannot be good for our development spend in ensuring it is effective and directed.”\nBrexit and the aid and trade ‘opportunity’\nThe U.K. development community is also grappling with the potential impact of Brexit. Parties offered their take on how to prioritize development goals as the U.K. government negotiates new trade deals after leaving the European Union, and considered DfID’s role in lobbying for developing countries’ interests in the coming negotiations.\nWhile some developing countries currently enjoy duty-free, quota-free access to U.K. markets under the European Partnership Agreements, many in the community view Brexit as an opportunity to expand the practice — boosting trade for the least-developed countries and possibly expanding the U.K.’s menu of options for low- and middle-income countries shopping for updated trade agreements. While Labour’s manifesto commits to this type of access as a minimum requirement for negotiating with least developed countries, the other party manifestos do not. Nonetheless, party representatives at last week’s debate appeared to be in agreement on the issue.\n“We set up a fund, not very well-known, that was designed specifically to help poor countries negotiate decent trade agreements, and I hope you’ll accept that that is testament to the government’s good intentions not on negotiating trade deals which are purely for Britain’s advantage, but decent trade deals, which we all know enrich everyone rich and poor alike,” the Conservative Party’s Mitchell said. “If you’re asking me, I would’ve thought [committing to duty-free and quota-free access for LDCs] would be one of the first things we would do.”\nMeanwhile, the Labour manifesto places a strong emphasis on negotiating development-conducive trade deals, also emphasizing the U.K.’s role as an aid donor to improve working conditions in overseas industries and bolstering the influence of trade unions in developing countries.\n“African countries fear access to their markets would undermine the development of their capability to trade, and that’s why I think we still need to assert very strongly that these countries need more than simply free trade agreements,” Lord Collins said. “You seem to hear from other politicians that we do need to protect and develop, not simply say we’re going to send all our goods into your country and you can send them to us. Africa is unique in those circumstances and as we move forward in Brexit we need to be very clear about that,” he said.\nPatrick Grady from Scotland’s main party, the Scottish National Party, also pointed out the need for “these trade deals to be climate-friendly,” especially considering the United States’ recent withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change. The decision “does mean that other countries need to step up and the Scottish government is committed,” Grady said.\nOthers seemed aligned with Grady’s view, albeit without offering next steps for the U.K. and international community to possibly compensate for U.S. emissions.\nOn other issues raised during the debate — including U.K. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, tax havens and the exploitation of tax systems in some low-income countries — there was less agreement, and the Conservatives’ Mitchell found himself standing alone on some of these issues.\nNonetheless, his authoritative performance at the debate and his critique of recent DfID decisions may give credence to rumors in the development community that he harbors plans to return to the U.K. aid agency.\nFor more U.K. news, views and analysis visit the Future of DfID series page, follow @devex on Twitter and tweet using the hashtag #FutureofDfID."},{"url":"http://hechingerreport.org/experts-offer-black-latino-college-students-8-tips-success-studying-together-becoming-tutor","title":"Experts offer black and Latino college students eight tips for success - The Hechinger Report","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Hechinger Report","description":"","date":"2017-05-24","full_text":"1. Find — or form — a group of students to study with so you can master the material.\n“Anybody who succeeds in science tends to work in some group,” says Freeman Hrabowski, president of the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. “I’m a mathematician and I’ve been doing it 40-plus years. But students who excel in high school are accustomed to being by themselves, working alone in their room. High schools teach kids that if you work with other people you’re cheating or you’re not smart.”\nIn programs like Meyerhoff Scholars at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County and Millennium Scholars at Penn State, students live together, eat together, socialize together — all to make it easier for them to study together. When students study together, they learn from each other and figure out what they might be doing wrong — which doesn’t happen when they study in isolation.\n“To see yourself as the helper rather than the help is really psychologically important for kids.”\nAs a doctoral student, Uri Treisman, now a math professor at the University of Texas at Austin, “saw Chinese students who were good at forming temporary but functional social groups. They didn’t necessarily like or want to socialize with the people in their study group, but they knew how to form a group to get something done. This is a very important skill for future leadership, where you have to form working groups to get stuff done all the time.”\n2. Whenever the opportunity arises, sign up to be a tutor.\nTreisman says that being a tutor has an enormous psychological benefit for black and Latino students. It also helps them learn the material more thoroughly. “When you’re a tutor for other students, you begin to understand at a deep level that you belong there and you can be successful. To see yourself as the helper rather than the help is really psychologically important for kids.”\n3. Try not to be too disturbed if people are surprised by your academic success.\nTreisman says he’s seen this racist phenomenon undermine students of color. “They don’t quite know how to make sense of this and it keeps eating away at them and undermines their confidence. We have to immunize them against that. Once people on campus see them as the tutor, as the campus leader, that stuff will start to fade away.” If students expect that it might happen, they will be less disturbed it if it does.\n4. For those pursuing STEM degrees, start with the introductory science courses, even if the college is telling you to skip those courses based on your AP performance in high school.\n“Anybody who succeeds in science tends to work in some group. … But students who excel in high school are accustomed to being by themselves, working alone in their room.”\n“Starting in advanced chemistry or organic chemistry or second-year biology is a bad, bad idea,” says Hrabowski. “The reason I had 12 students — half black, half white and Asian — interview at Harvard Medical School recently, not just for the M.D. but many for the M.D./Ph.D., is we would never allow students to start with advanced organic chemistry. Even if they had 5’s on the AP exam. The point is to get them a stronger foundation. But it’s part of the culture at many schools, where everybody will think you’re slow if you start with freshman-level work. Everybody wants to show how smart they are. So all these kids start with advanced-level work — and they get C’s and D’s. And they don’t tell anybody about it. And then they change their majors.”\n5. Go to the tutorial center and to professors’ office hours often — before you need help.\nIf you get in the habit of doing that at the beginning of each course, you will gain such a strong understanding of the material that you’ll never need to go there out of desperation.\n6. Get to class before the professor, sit in the front row with other students in your study group and ask plenty of questions.\nThis will slowly begin to change the professors’ perceptions of the abilities of students of color, which tend to be negative on many campuses.\n7. Look for opportunities to work as teaching assistants in the classroom.\n“We had almost 400 LAs [learning assistants] volunteering in our classrooms this semester,” said Mary Beth Williams, professor of chemistry at Penn State University and associate dean for undergraduate education. “That’s a culture change in our own students — a change in the expectations of faculty and how we can engage students in classrooms, and also students changing their mindset as they learn how to learn. Students engaged in an active process in their learning is wholly different from sitting in the library cubicle or in their dorm rooms. The science shows us that is not how students learn the best.”\n8. Just because you don’t get an A doesn’t mean you’re doomed.\nWilliams said she is bothered by the way many students, particularly women, react when they get a grade lower than what they were used to in high school. “If they get something less than an A on a single exam or in a course at the end of the semester, they sometimes interpret that as not being good enough,” Williams said. “That is the wrong interpretation. We need parents to understand that is something that can happen, it’s OK and we need to help students understand that you don’t have to get an A in everything to go to med school. You don’t have to get an A in everything to be successful. They should learn from what just happened. What can they improve with the ways they study or the ways they learn? But don’t give up. Building up that resilience and grit is incredibly important. We see less of it in incoming college students than we have in the past.”\nThis story was written by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

Counties in the western, central, and even eastern parts of the state are home to coal mines. But far less coal comes out of the ground than it used to. On this episode, we’ll head to southwestern Pennsylvania where coal mining is a strong part of the area’s identity, and find out what some miners there are grappling with. We’ll hear from our reporter Margaret J. Krauss about a mine rescue team, a retired coal miner worried about his future, and a former miner who had to find new work.\nA member of the Mettiki Mine Rescue team prepared for one of the mine rescue competition’s timed events, the live burn: teams contain and then extinguish a fire in the hangar. They wear flame-resistant suits, fire-rated gloves, and breathing apparatuses. (Margaret J. Krauss/WESA)\nNo one had heard from the maintenance foreman or the mechanic since the power in the coal mine went out at 7:15 a.m. Brandon Mullins and his team, one of two mine rescue teams from the Bailey Mine complex, responded to the emergency.\nMullins stood at the entrance of the mine and brought the team up to speed with what he knew. “A fireboss...could hear someone yelling for help...thinks he saw smoke.”\nIn near pitch-black conditions, the team’s headlamps cut the dark as they loaded first aid gear into a cart. Mullins made sure they had what they needed.\n“You got ARV [automatic rescue ventilator], everything? All your first aid stuff on you, right? You’re gonna be in smoke, I’d go ahead and get ready.”\nDespite it being cooler in the mine than outside, everyone was sweating. Mullins headed for the command center so he could direct his team through the mine. He radioed through to the the team: “Sounds like we’re looking for two guys.”\nThe team confirmed: “Two guys,” and headed out.\nMullins was marking his team’s progress on a map when Don Krek stuck his head into the command center.\n“Lunches are here, let your team know,” he said.\n“Thank you,” said Mullins. He looked across the room to a clock showing his team’s time: 36 minutes.\nMembers of the Mettiki Mine Rescue team regrouped after extinguishing a fire during the live burn exercise, and carefully rolled up their hoses. “There’s lots of sharp, pointy things in a coal mine,” said Austin Ponceroff, a member of the Harvey Mine Rescue Team. He was waiting for his team’s first event. “If you don’t take care of your hoses, you’re going to be in bad shape.” (Margaret J. Krauss/WESA)\nThe Bailey team was one of eleven teams in the midst of a mine rescue skills contest at the Mining Technology and Training Center (MTTC) in Ruff Creek, Pennsylvania, a community not far from the West Virginia border. Teams raced the clock in four kinds of timed events: first aid support skills, mine rescue, smoke exploration, and firefighting.\nCoal mining is an inherently risky endeavor. Miners command big machines in close quarters surrounded by flammable material in both underground and surface mines. While mining disasters today are rare, they can still happen; and the people trained to respond to those emergencies are other coal miners.\nMost coal mines, if they’re big enough, have mine rescue teams. They’re the volunteer firefighters of the coal mining industry. There’s no extra pay for being on a team, no bonus. Just hours of drills, and the knowledge that anything could go wrong at any time, and they’re the ones on call. At minimum, they train 96 hours a year. One way to get those hours in is to participate in contests.\nDon Krek, 62, was one of the judges at the Ruff Creek competition. He was on a mine rescue team for 25 of the 38 years he spent working in the coal mines.\n“Whole thing is with the mine rescue guys, and that’s what my wife doesn’t understand about me is, we’re going in a coal mine that everybody’s running out of,” said Krek.\nBut mine rescue guys aren’t heroes, he said; they’re just regular guys who have the training, and therefore the confidence to do what needs to be done.\n“I guess you just will yourself to do things in life,” said Krek. “I was responsible for the guys behind me. I knew their wives, their families, their kids. I never let them down. Thankfully, I never had to.”\nKrek walked me through the simulation mine, explaining how the first aid support skills and mine rescue exercises work. He and the other judges worked for months to design the emergencies, making sure the incidents stayed within the complex set of guidelines that govern the contests.\nBecause they weren’t going to pump smoke into the mine during the competition — though they can — pieces of laminated paper alerted teams to changing conditions they needed to watch and adjust for. Krek pointed them out. They said things like “ankle deep water” or “carbon monoxide” with the concentration printed below. As Krek walked, the crushed stone floor threw little puffs of dust into the beam of his light, visible against the black plywood walls.\n“These guys don’t realize what they have here,” said Krek, looking around him. “I started in 1980. Our first real life practice was at a real coal mine. You had your contest training, but a contest training is nothing like real life. We learned the hard way.”\nDon Krek was on a mine rescue team for 25 of the 38 years he spent working in the coal industry. Though he’s retired now, Krek, 62, jumped at the chance to continue training mine rescue teams. “It gives me the opportunity now to give back to the guys that haven’t been and, [hopefully] never will have to go into a real event.” (Margaret J. Krauss/WESA)\nIn January of 2006, Krek got a call: he and his team were needed in Sago, West Virginia, about four hours away. It wasn’t his first rescue call, by any stretch, but it’s the call he mentions when he talks about being ready at a moment’s notice.\n“We got up where the explosion was at its fiercest and there was a lot of carnage up there. Lot of things misplaced, so to speak, with the force of an explosion.”\nHe didn’t say anything for a little while, then started walking again.\n“I don’t talk about Sago. I can’t.”\nUltimately, 12 men died in the Sago Mine Disaster. The rescue teams were able to save only one person.\nKrek hopes these guys never have to respond to a real emergency. But if they do, he wants them to be ready.\n“When you’re in the real event, no matter if you’re physically exhausted, mentally, you have to be sharp,” he said.\nEarly in the morning, the Harvey Mine Rescue Team from Sycamore, Pennsylvania, had some time to kill before their first exercise. They stood on the edge of a field, talking quietly.\nYou have to treat the competitions like it’s the real deal, but you can’t simulate what it feels like, said Austin Ponceroff, 28. He’s part of the Harvey Mine Rescue Team.\n“Adrenaline. That’s the x-factor, you know? Whenever you get that call at 2 o’clock in the morning and you’re laying in bed, and just like you drank 15 pots of coffee,” he said.\nPonceroff used to go to competitions with his dad, who’s still part of a mine rescue team.\n“My mom flipped out whenever I wanted to do this. I said, ‘Well, look at it this way. If dad’s ever stuck in a mine, who do you want going after him?’ I said, ‘The same person I want coming after me,’ you know what I mean.”\nWhile they waited for their first exercise, the Harvey Mine team watched another crew suit up for the live burn exercise.\nThe hangar, which housed the live burn, sits on the edge of some woods. At first, it was hard to tell the difference between the morning mist and smoke seeping out of the seams of the building. (One team had already fought the blaze inside).\nThe guys pulled on fire-rated gloves, and breathing apparatus, and a judge walked over to a control panel. There was a rush of sound, as though the pilot light of a huge gas stove had just ignited.\nI looked back at Ponceroff and the rest of his team. One guy was explaining to a teammate why it was important that his suit cover his entire body. A few others were just watching the exercise unfold. Another couple guys were chatting about their kids’ baseball games, a double-header coming up.\nThey were leaning casually on a white propane tank feeding the fire inside the hangar. Roughly 150 feet away from a structure purposely being lit on fire, the guys were draped over a highly flammable object.\n“Is that just a giant propane tank?” I asked.\nThey laughed.\n“Yes it is,” one guy said. “If it blows up, we can’t save you on that.”\nPonceroff got his first mining job seven years ago. He needed the benefits, including insurance and a reliable schedule.\n“I had two children and I had a third one on the way. You can’t make any money doing construction. I mean, you can. But not working nine months a year,” said Ponceroff. “So I pursued this career...I like what I do on a daily basis, and I really enjoy doing this [mine rescue].”\nBack inside the simulation mine, Krek watched a team working through the rescue problem. They had just identified a trapped miner. The air was bad. The team had on their oxygen masks, yelling to one another to be heard. The sound of it made my heart race, as though something awful really had happened.\nKrek leaned over and said to me: “What they have now, they have a guy to rescue.”\nHe was holding a map of the mine, and showed me the conditions the team was up against.\n“You get blocked here, you gotta figure out how to get back out now to the elevator,” said Krek. But the thing is, where they’re gonna get docked, discounted right now, that patient that they got out over there? They’re gonna walk him right into low oxygen.”\nIn other words, that guy wouldn’t get enough oxygen, and he’d die. This is what Krek was talking about: he likes to throw curveballs at the end of a long day, to keep things as real as possible.\n“I’ll do it every time, only cause I love them. That’s what I tell them. ‘Guys, [I] only do this cause I love you, man,’” he said. “I say, ‘When you leave here and you get called next day go to a real event, I want it to be easy for you.’”\nHe looked at the map, and back at the team. They were standing in a circle, discussing how best to proceed. Krek shook his head, disappointed.\n“It’s up to them and they’re not sharp,” he said. “These guys aren’t sharp at all.”\nMiners push an “empty” through a coal mine in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania circa 1907. (Stereograph image from the Library of Congress)\nWhen coal mining was at its peak in Pennsylvania in 1918, the state produced more than 30 percent of the nation’s coal and employed 330,000 people. Throughout the 20th century, coal from Pennsylvania helped fuel two World Wars and build the nation’s bridges, highways, and skyscrapers.\nIn 1984, there were over 1,000 coal mines in Pennsylvania, employing nearly 27,000 people. But just a couple years later, the industry hit a record low, and never really recovered.\nBy 2015, fewer than 7,000 people worked in the state’s coal mines, producing just six percent of the nation’s coal.\nWhen Dave VanSickle started coal mining in the 1970s, it was a different world.\nVanSickle and his wife, Sandy, live in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, about an hour southeast of Pittsburgh. I visited them one afternoon to talk about the forty years VanSickle spent in the coal industry.\nThe first thing that struck me about their house was how spotless it is. I learned later that VanSickle had always wanted a house to be proud of.\n“It was rough growing up. It gave me life lessons, which made me say that I was going to do better,” said VanSickle. “I was going to have a home that I was proud to bring someone to, that my kids could bring people over any time they wanted to. Just give them a life I never had.”\nVanSickle grew up about 12 miles from here in a community called Woodside. Every steel mill seemed to have its own mine, he said, and the whole area was coal patches, each with its own mine.\nAll the houses looked the same, four rooms and a basement. VanSickle said he had a pretty normal childhood. All the kids had a bike, a baseball glove, and dads in the mines.\n“Growing up, back then where my dad worked, they didn’t have bathhouses. So when he came home he was black as coal,” he said. “He worked a lot of [the] afternoon shift throughout my childhood. He was there on the weekends. But through the week when I was in school, I never seen dad.”\nWhen he graduated, VanSickle said he was offered scholarships to play baseball in Pennsylvania and Arizona. But he turned them down.\n“Back then, your parents were different. I mean, once you turned of age, it was time to get out of the house, get a job, and move on with life’s work,” said VanSickle.\nAnd in the early 1970s, a kid right out of high school could make a solid, middle-class wage.\n“It was just so easy to get that job and go on and have money. And back then, you know—18, 19 years old—you’re thinking about girls and drinking and everything else,” he laughed. “So college kind of just got put out of the way.”\nDave VanSickle stands with his wife, Sandy at their home in Uniontown with their daughter, Tammy Kezmarksky. Their dogs, Maya and Ozzie, wait expectantly in the background. A third-generation miner, VanSickle worked for in coal for 40 years. The decline in the industry has threatened his pension. (Margaret J. Krauss/WESA)\nFor nearly his whole career, VanSickle worked at the Cumberland mine in Greene County. Today, it’s still a productive underground mine. He described coal mining as building a little city underground: there are roads, lights, rail lines that run between different neighborhoods. All of it driven by a sense of purpose and exploration.\n“You step somewhere where no one has ever stepped before, when that coal’s extracted and you move ahead,” he said. “Nobody’s ever been there before. You are the first person to touch that area of the earth.”\nIt was a good living, said VanSickle. But he told his kids there would be no fourth-generation coal miners. He held up his hands. On each, he’s missing the first knuckle on one of his fingers, from two different accidents.\n“It’s a dangerous job. It’s a hard job. It’s a dirty job. All my friends have basically the same ailments as me,” said VanSickle. “We have some type of black lung. We’re all on breathing machines at night from sleep apnea, which is brought on by the coal dust in your lungs.”\nAs we talked, VanSickle tempered anything he thought might sound like complaining by pointing out he made these decisions. He worked for the life he has. Yes, it took a toll on him; but he wanted to make a good living for his family, put his two kids through college, and he did. End of story.\nWhat stings is what happened after he retired in 2014.\nVanSickle is one of the 17,000 retired union miners, living in Pennsylvania, who rely on pension and health benefits guaranteed by the companies they once worked for.\nCoal mining is a dangerous, physically demanding job. And traditionally, even when coal miners weren’t making a lot of money, they were guaranteed top-of-the-line health care. Later, pension benefits were added. In union mines like VanSickle’s, pensions and health care were frequent bargaining chips between companies and their employees.\nVanSickle explained that companies would argue something like: “We can’t give you a matching 401K because you have guaranteed pension and health care.We can’t give you a dollar an hour raise. We can only give you 25 cents because you have guaranteed pensions and health care.”\nCoal companies normally fund miners’ benefits. But as the industry declined, some companies filed for bankruptcy; and through court proceedings, many shed their obligations to pay into those funds. That’s left VanSickle’s union, the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), scrambling to cover its retirees. Congress recently acted to protect miners’ health care, but the future of their pensions is unclear.\nVanSickle said he’s a worrier. Everything he’s worked for—the house, the peace and quiet, the time and money to spend on his grandchildren—is in jeopardy.\n“My American dream was to work 40 years. To be promised a pension. To be promised health care. To be able to go on a vacation every year. To be able to take our grandchildren wherever we want to,” he said. “And now everything’s on hold. It’s just been taken away.”\nIf his and Sandy’s parents are any indication, VanSickle figures they have a few good years before they get sick. In the last year or so, he’s spent a lot of time on buses, traveling to Washington, DC with the United Mine Workers to lobby Congress to protect their benefits. He and his friends tell each other their fathers, many of whom were also miners, would be rolling in their graves if they knew what was happening.\n“We don’t feel that we’re asking for anything that we don’t deserve and work for all our life,” VanSickle said. “I believe in promises. If I make you a promise, I’m going to keep it. They made us a promise and they reneged on it.”\nJosh Beltowski mined coal until the industry hit a low in 2015. Rather than wait to be laid off, he left the mines and bought a logging business from a man ready to retire. As an independent contractor, Beltowski hauls logs for a number of different clients. Here, he helps clear land for a strip mine. (Margaret J. Krauss/WESA)\nFor many younger miners today, the expectations have changed. As demand for cheap natural gas has grown, the coal industry has contracted, making jobs harder and harder to find. When coal mining hit a low point nationwide in 2015, many workers were laid off and had to find other work.\nThat’s when I first met Josh Beltowski, in December 2015. He’d quit the mines a few weeks before and seemed pretty glum. He’d wanted to work underground since he was a kid and then, when he’d finally worked his way in, the market tanked. But when he started to talk about his plans to build a logging business with the truck he’d just bought, he seemed hopeful.\nI got back in touch with him recently, and asked if I could ride along with him for a day.\nInstead of meeting out in the woods or at the lumber mill, Beltowski said it would be easiest to pick me up. He told me to park at the abandoned restaurant across from the gas station in Burnside, about two hours east of Pittsburgh. That would give him enough room to turn around and get back on the road.\nAs Beltowski climbed down from the cab, he was grinning, ear to ear. A big logo on both doors read “Josh Beltowski Logging.”\nBeltowski hauls logs for a bunch of different clients, going back and forth from the woods to the mill. He bought the business from an older guy who was ready to retire. I asked if he remembered the first time he drove the truck.\n“It was a pretty cool feeling...knowing that it was mine,” he said. “This was my career... God willing, this was what I was going to do for the rest of my life.”\nBeltowski considers himself lucky to have the work. He’s a trained heavy-equipment mechanic who loves being outside in the woods, and doesn’t like sitting still.\n“I like getting stuff done. I like the satisfaction of a finished product, a finished day,” he said. “I like setting my goal in the morning.”\nThat’s how he was in the mines, too.\n“I liked coming out of there knowing that I loaded more than the shift before me, or loaded more than we did yesterday,” he said. “To compare ourselves to ourselves instead of somebody else... always bettering ourselves.”\nThese days, Beltowski usually gets up around 3:30 in the morning or so, and tries to get out of the house by 4:30. Sometimes if the weather is good, and there’s a lot of work, he’ll haul all night, get a few hours sleep, and go right back out again.\n“I have too many hobbies to not have an income. Hunting, fishing, and golfing. I mean, it’s not cheap,” he laughed. “I don’t know what I’d do without a job. That’s my biggest worry.”\nWe came to the end of a paved road and Beltowski turned the truck right, into the woods and onto a rutted dirt path. The cab jolted back and forth. He was clearing land for a strip mine.\n“It was a nice forest couple days ago, and now it’s getting destroyed. But those are jobs. And those are resources that we have the technology and ability to harvest, to use,” he said. “I don’t want to see them get cut down either, but I do because that’s what I do for a living.”\nBeltowski continued.\n“I wish they grew faster, put it that way. I wish you could cut one down and have another one in two weeks. That’d be great for me,” he said. “But that’s not the way it works. You gotta do what you do.”\nBeltowski spends most of his days alone, now; and he misses the camaraderie of mining.\n“Number one thing I miss. I still have a little bit of it, but nothing of the caliber that I was used to,” he said. “It’s definitely something I would enjoy having back.”\nHis wife, Whit, said to me if her husband could clone himself, he’d do both: run the logging business and mine coal.\n“I’d love to just take a day and go down and do it again, bolt another cut or mine another cut,” Beltowski said.\nWhen he walked me out to my car that evening, Beltowski pointed out some land he and his wife own across the street. It’s thick with trees. He said someday he hopes to log the land with his own cutting crew, maybe get another truck.\nAfter we said goodbye, Beltowski headed inside for dinner, though he wouldn’t stay long: the weather was good and there was money to be made. The plan was to haul logs off the strip mine all night.\nHe doesn’t like to sit still."},{"url":"http://www.fayobserver.com/news/20170606/trump-infrastructure-push-faces-cold-shoulder-from-congress/1","title":"Trump infrastructure push faces cold shoulder from Congress","author_text":"The Associated Press","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Fayetteville Observer","description":"Repairing the nation's crumbling roads and bridges was supposed to be an area ripe for bipartisan compromise between congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump.

Instead, Democrats are panning Trump’s proposed $1 trillion overhaul and even Republicans are balking at some aspects of the emerging plan.\nWASHINGTON — Repairing the nation’s crumbling roads and bridges was supposed to be an area ripe for bipartisan compromise between congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump. Instead, Democrats are panning Trump’s proposed $1 trillion overhaul and even Republicans are balking at some aspects of the emerging plan.\nThe White House’s self-proclaimed “Infrastructure Week” began with Trump appearing Monday with aviation officials and some prominent GOP lawmakers to announce plans to privatize the nation’s air traffic control system and separate operations from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n“We live in a modern age yet our air traffic control system is stuck, painfully, in the past,” Trump said, noting the FAA had been working to upgrade the system for years.\nBut the proposal quickly drew bipartisan opposition, and there were few signs it would get far on Capitol Hill. “All but our largest airports nationwide stand to be hurt by this proposal,” said Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas.\nNext up will be a series of events throughout the week, including some with the nation’s mayors and governors, that will allow Trump to highlight his effort to muster public and private funding to overhaul the highway, waterway, electrical and airway systems on which the nation depends. The president plans to travel to Ohio on Wednesday to address ways of improving levees, dams and locks along inland waterways that are crucial to agricultural exports.\nThe details of the plans must still be fleshed out. According to Trump’s budget proposal, the funding would come from $200 billion in tax breaks over nine years that would then — in theory — leverage $1 trillion worth of construction.\nBut although the goal of upgrading crucial infrastructure has broad support, Democrats do not like Trump’s plan for paying for it, arguing that his approach would result in taxpayer-funded corporate profits at the expense of investments in rural areas where money-making opportunities are scarce.\n“A private-sector-driven infrastructure plan means tolls, tolls, tolls — paid by average, working Americans,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. “It also means that infrastructure that can’t be built with tolls, like repairing our crumbling schools, for instance, will likely get left behind.”\nSchumer struck a far different tone in the days immediately after Trump’s election, when he told The Associated Press that infrastructure investment was an area where Trump appeared more aligned with Democrats than with Republicans. Indeed, Schumer said that he’d spoken with Trump, offering his own support for a large infrastructure package but warning that conservative Republicans were unlikely to go along.\nConservative opposition remains a potential roadblock to Trump’s infrastructure plans. Nonetheless, the White House appears to be making little effort to round up bipartisan support on the issue. Trump is holding a series of meetings Tuesday with members of Congress, but they’re all Republicans. And Schumer’s spokesman, Matt House, said the White House never responded after Democrats presented their own infrastructure blueprint in January and shared it with the administration.\nInstead of involving the private sector, Democrats’ preferred method is to simply add $1 trillion to the deficit to pay for a range of infrastructure projects they claimed would create 15 million jobs over 10 years.\nStill, the White House legislative affairs director, Marc Short, told reporters in a briefing Monday night that the goal remained to get Democratic support for the infrastructure package.\n“Infrastructure, the president’s said all along he believes to be a bipartisan exercise and it’s one that we will be looking to partner with them on,” Short said.\nThe White House and Republicans are already proceeding on a partisan basis with their other two big legislative projects, health care and taxes, with uncertain chances for success on both. Chances for infrastructure legislation may be dim, too, given the poisonous atmosphere in Washington as an undisciplined president courts controversy over Twitter and an angry liberal base goads Democratic lawmakers to battle him at every turn. The investigation into Russian election meddling and ties with Trump’s campaign hang over everything.\n“This is not what he campaigned on and I think his voters are going to figure that out, sooner rather than later,” said Sen.

On May 26, Wallerand de Saint-Just, NP treasurer who also is an elected official of the city of Paris, challenged the Socialist Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, to explain why the city was putting on an event \"promoting a concept that is blatantly racist and anti-republican\".\nThe International League against Racism and Antisemitism (LICRA), an anti-racist organisation close to the French government, also joined in on the condemnation of the festival and claimed that Rosa Parks \"would be turning in her grave\", referring to the American civil rights icon. \"The fight against racism has become an alibi for identity isolationism,\" the organisation said.\nREAD MORE: Rokhaya Diallo: 'France sees itself as a white country'\nOn May 28, Hidalgo responded to the controversy on Twitter and firmly condemned the organisation of an event, \"prohibited to white people\". \"I am asking for this festival to be banned,\" the mayor said, adding that she also reserved the right \"to prosecute the organisers for discrimination\".\nThe event that triggered this storm was the Nyansapo Festival, organised by the Afro-feminist collective Mwasi. The festival is scheduled to take place on July 28-30 in Paris and contrary to what its detractors assert, it is going to be open to all.\nThe white identity is so central to France that any event that brings white dominance into question swiftly triggers a solidarity that breaks down partisan political divides.\nHowever, some \"non-mixed\" workshops reserved solely for black women, will also be set up as part of the festival. These workshops will provide a safe space for black women to have private conversations among themselves. It is true that these workshops will not welcome whites, but they will also not welcome people of Arab, Asian or Roma origin and will not even open their doors to black men.\nIt is understandable why the extreme right, in its racist logic, tries to sabotage a festival organised by black women by outrageously focusing on the \"unfair\" treatment of whites.\nHowever, it is hard to understand how a defamatory campaign by a nationalist party could find such an echo among left-wing politicians and institutions working to eliminate racism. How can they form an unlikely alliance with the far-right and parrot the false accusations coming from these groups?\nThe answer is simple: the miracle of \"white supremacy\". The white identity is so central to France that any event that brings white dominance into question swiftly triggers a solidarity that breaks down partisan political divides.\nThroughout history and all over the world, non-mixing has been an indispensable tool for bringing subordinate groups together by allowing them to discuss their conditions and develop strategies to build their emancipation in complete safety.\nWould we blame trade unionists for not inviting their employers to their meetings? Would we force women who are victims of rape to welcome men into theirs? Certainly not.\nREAD MORE: Sister of rape victim Theo: 'Police consider us rats'\nMoreover, the city of Paris already hosts several non-mixed, women's associations such as \"the House of the women of Paris\", without any polemic or controversy.\nThe history of French feminism is built on the idea of non-mixing. In the 1970s, the Women's Liberation Movement (MLF), inspired by American black movements, chose gender-based non-mixing as its mode of political organisation.\nIn 1970, the MLF stated \"We have arrived at the necessity of non-mixing. We realised that, like all other oppressed groups, it is up to us to take charge of our own liberation\". Thanks to these meetings, French women had the opportunity to enunciate their priority demands and they gained the right to abortion, among other things.\nPolitical scientist Françoise Verges, who took part in these meetings, remembers the numerous attacks that they faced at the time, but she believes that the controversy surrounding the Nyansapo Festival is still a first: \"Never before has an anti-racist organisation or a left-wing elected representative sought to use the law to prohibit [these meetings] ... This is the first time that an organisation that calls itself anti-racist and a left-wing politician trust the fachosphere\".\nAccording to the academic, the reasoning behind this unprecedented trust is unequivocal: \"The left-wing politician and the so-called anti-racist organisation are reacting this way because [the festival is for] black women\".\n\"They are not disturbed by the non-mixed nature of the event; they are disturbed because this non-mixing is practised by black women\".\nIn France, black women are subject to multiple types of discrimination every day and they often struggle to be recognised as French citizens. Non-mixed meetings allow them to interact with each other freely. In these meetings, they get a chance to be removed from the gaze of the dominant ones, who tend to monopolise discussions and ask questions or offer comments that slow down the conversation.\nBlack women must be allowed to come together without being forced to justify their actions to people who do not face similar oppressions. They must be free to express their anger and resentment without the fear of vexing others.\nIn our country, black women are invisible in the public sphere. The few who dare to venture there are frequently exposed to outrageous insults, such as the former minister of justice, Christiane Taubira, who has been compared to an ape on several occasions.\nWhy should black women open up one of the few spheres dedicated to them to please people who already have wide access to the public sphere?\nLICRA and other critics of the Nyansapo Festival have drawn a parallel between the non-mixing nature of the festival and the practice of apartheid. This is an odious comparison, because the festival does not propose a separatist society project, but instead it aims to provide black women with a space where they can temporarily escape from the clutches of oppression and breathe freely. This does not deprive any other group of their rights and it can in no way be compared to a state-sponsored regime, which is based on establishing a racial hierarchy and officially depriving parts of a population of goods and services.\nREAD MORE: Race in the US: Herstory\n\"We think we are in the best position to grasp the weapons of our own emancipation,\" say the feminists of Mwasi. History has proved this so many times before, those directly affected by exclusion are the ones most qualified to lead their own liberation.\nFrance is struggling to embrace its multicultural face. Officially, it does not recognise ethnic, religious, linguistic or cultural minorities. In this context, daring to identify as a black woman is an unbearable subversion. In France, minorities that are trying to achieve autonomy are labeled \"communitarian\". They are accused of threatening national cohesion and the republican French \"universalist\" ideal.\nThis ideal, however, is belied every single day by the massive discrimination that affects the non-white members of the French population, whether as they struggle to find employment or as they face police violence.\nIn 2014, Anne Hidalgo presented herself, without any embarrassment, as the mayor of Paris who would head the twenty white candidates that ran under the Socialist Party's ticket to become the mayors of Parisian districts. There was not a single Arab, Black or Asian person to represent the inhabitants of one of the most multicultural cities in Europe. Just like the ones that govern other French circles of power - economic, media and political – the white \"communitarianism\" of the municipality of Paris under Hidalgo was never questioned.\nTo overcome systemic racism in France and in other Western democracies, it is not the minority survival initiatives that should be combatted, but the centrality of white domination.\nRokhaya Diallo, French journalist, writer and filmmaker, is widely recognised for her work in favour of racial, gender and religious equality.

A joint operation by Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County in the downtown area is underway in an effort to immediately affect public health and safety there.\nSALT LAKE CITY — Straining under tremendous need, Salt Lake County is asking for half of the state's available grant money to begin filling the financial gap created when key elements of ambitious criminal justice reforms went unfunded.\nSalt Lake County's mayor, sheriff and top prosecutor unveiled a request Tuesday for $3.6 million of an available $6 million in grant money from the state — more than the county's anticipated allotment of $1.9 million — in hopes of funding a four-pronged response to crime, addiction, mental illness and homelessness.\nAn additional request for $4.4 million is expected next year.\nThe grant money supports programs and services intended to back up the Justice Reinvestment Initiative, which two years ago dropped a number of low-level felony drug crimes down to misdemeanors in hopes of stemming the steady flow of drug offenders headed to the Utah State Prison.\nThe decrease in penalties was meant to be accompanied by increased opportunities for treatment and intervention paid for in large part through Medicaid expansion, which later failed.\nWithout Medicaid money, counties found themselves carrying the weight of underfunded behavioral health programs and overbooked jails.\n\"What we know is that without funding for treatment, public safety will be jeopardized and the Justice Reinvestment Initiative will fail,\" Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams said at a Tuesday press conference.\nMcAdams was joined by Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill and Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder. The announcement detailing plans for long-term solutions also included an admonition from the county leaders insinuating that Salt Lake City hasn't done its part to clean up the Rio Grande neighborhood in the interim.\nInvesting the state's grant money in Salt Lake County, an area that is already managing the bulk of the state's criminal cases and is home to numerous established service providers, offers the greatest promise for success, Gill said.\n\"If you talk about the biggest impact for the return on investment for taxpayers, to make systemic improvements for criminal justice reform, that investment in a preexisting program or infrastructure will give them the best return and will make the largest, quickest impact,\" Gill said.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done\nThe biggest ticket item in the county's plan is a specialty court — \"Diversion Court\" — for those detained in Operation Diversion efforts near the downtown homeless shelter, which police and political leaders have called an attempt to separate vulnerable individuals in need of help from the criminals who prey on their problems.\nAs he reemphasized his committment to aggressively prosecute criminals who exploit Utah's needy, homeless, mentally ill or addicted, Gill insisted locking up those with genuine needs is not a solution.\nBut the county's plan — following Operation Diversion's goals to separate criminals from their targets with a \"unique prosecution strategy\" designed to keep those in need involved in treatment — could be, Gill said.\n\"Our prosecution team will specifically target, prosecute and monitor with compliance the most violent and predatory offenders in one track, and provide treatment, supervision and continuity of support for the drug addicted and mentally ill with the expansion of this program,\" Gill said.\n\"This needs to be an investment committment for the long haul, randomizing our law enforcement operation to disrupt the criminal element and provide treatment and safety for those in need if we truly want to change the paradigm currently in play,\" Gill said.\nLike the county's existing drug and mental health courts, Diversion Court would be a rehabilitative program focused on ending cycles of crime and addiction rather than on punishing those detained in the randomized roundups.\nIn three Operation Diversion sweeps last year, those identified as candidates for services were given a choice: go to jail or be admitted wait-free into treatment programs without facing any criminal charges.\nNoella Sudbury, Criminal Justice Advisory Council coordinator and an author of the grant, said in an interview prior to Tuesday's press conference that for some, Operation Diversion was exactly the intervention they needed.\nHowever, many others who where ushered to the front of the line at coveted treatment centers walked straight out the back door.\n\"They're choosing treatment over jail, because that's the option presented now, but really (they have) no intention of completing the program,\" Sudbury said. \"(It) lacks the structure needed — a case manager, officers, attorneys — to really help them see the value of these programs.\"\nThe answer, Sudbury said, is a more defined path for them to follow, built up with encompassing support and services.\nThrough the specialty court, those who choose to receive treatment rather than go to jail would begin by being charged and entering a plea, which would be held in abeyance throughout the program and dismissed when they complete it. They would still be given immediate access to treatment, Sudbury said, and as more funding becomes available, be connected with housing and employment opportunities.\nThe team designing the court has also consulted with prosecutors and judges across the Wasatch Front about the possibility of transferring ongoing cases in other jurisdictions to the Operation Diversion court in order to allow participants to resolve all of their outstanding charges at once.\nIt's a complicated innovation that Sudbury acknowledges she's apprehensive about.\n\"What we see with these individuals is they don't just have the charges they're picked up on on the day of Operation Diversion,\" Sudbury said. \"So can we together, with all of the attorneys and case managers and court team … consolidate all of those cases, and say one of the advantages of this program is we're going to deal with all of those legal issues.\"\n\"It's really, 'Do you want to change your life?' Because this could change your life,\" Sudbury said.\nThe court program comes with a $2 million price tag to get started, with hopes of receiving another $2.9 million next year, according to the grant application.\nAlso on the county's wish list is $1.2 million to support the Intensive Supervised Probation program for those with substance abuse problems at high risk of reoffending. The relatively new program is showing positive early results, and is at capacity with 200 participants, Sudbury said. The grant would allow for 170 new openings.\nAnother $324,000 has been requested to open 10 new treatment beds for use through the county's successful drug court program in order to help cut down wait times for the long list of defendants hoping to get in.\nAnd $85,000 is being sought to create a task force within the Unified Police Department specifically for responding to mental health related calls, modeled after a program in use in Los Angeles. The department fields approximately 3,500 documented mental health calls each year, Sudbury notes. The specialized team, including a full-time clinician, would not only be dispatched to mental health emergencies but would keep records intended to prepare officers for future calls regarding the same person.\nIf funding is awarded to get the programs off the ground this year, the county intends to seek more grant money in 2018 to keep building them up.\nGill said Tuesday that if the Justice Reinvestment Initiative continues devoid of funding and instead becomes nothing more than an avenue to incarcerate those in need in jail rather than prison, it has fallen short of its goals.\nLast year, the Utah Association of Counties had asked the Legislature for nearly $17 million for behavioral and mental health services across the state, but lawmakers only set aside the $6 million now up for grabs.\nSalt Lake County is absorbing much of the cost of its Justice Reinvestment Initiative programs into existing budgets, Sudbury said, but which elements of the county's four priorities will become reality depends on how much grant money is awarded.\nThe decision is expected by July 1.\n\"I'm not sure we're going to be able to fund all of these programs and so, even though we've had a lot of conversations about these ideas and what they would look like, I think everybody knows that we might not get all the money and so let's see what we have and then we can really work out some of those details,\" Sudbury said."},{"url":"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/analysis-reveals-racial-disparities-school-arrests","title":"Analysis reveals racial disparities in school arrests","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"PBS NewsHour","description":"In 43 states and the District of Columbia, black students are arrested at school at disproportionately high levels, an analysis of federal data by the Education Week Research Center finds.

In 28 states, the share of arrested students who are black is at least 10 percentage points higher than their share of enrollment in schools with at least one arrest. In 10 of those states, that gap is at least 20 percentage points.\nNo other student racial or ethnic groups face such disparities in as many states.\nIn Virginia, black students make up 39 percent of the enrollment in public schools with at least one arrest but 75 percent of school-based arrests. In Louisiana, black students comprise 40 percent of enrollment in schools with at least one arrest but 69 percent of students arrested at school.\nStudents from other racial and ethnic groups are also arrested at disproportionate rates in a smaller number of states. In Connecticut, for example, Hispanic students make up 25 percent of enrollment in schools with arrests but represent 35 percent of students arrested at school. And in Arizona, Native Americans comprise 8 percent of enrollment in schools with arrests, but 23 percent of students arrested.\nNationwide, black boys are at the highest risk, three times as likely to be arrested at school as their white male peers. And African-American girls fare little better: They are more than 1.5 times as likely as white boys to be arrested, the analysis shows.\nIn four states with disproportionately high arrest rates for black students, the gap between their representation in overall enrollment and in the share of students arrested is quite narrow—within 3 percentage points. In these states, black students make up a relatively low share of overall enrollment.\nNationwide, about 8,000 schools reported a total of nearly 70,000 arrests in the 2013-14 school year. Black students were more likely than their white peers to attend a school where arrests occurred. When black students’ share of arrests is compared to their overall enrollment in all schools, the disparities are even more severe.\nAnd rates of student referrals to law enforcement show similar patterns of racial disparities at the state and national levels. Nationwide, black students made up 17 percent of enrollment in schools that referred students to law enforcement, but were 26 percent of students who were referred, the analysis found. Referrals, which are more common than arrests, are broadly defined as any time a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official “regardless of whether official action is taken,” according to the federal data set. Referrals can include citations, court referrals, and, in some cases, arrests.\nAll of these findings mirror a host of persistent disparities for students of color, including higher rates of school suspensions, less exposure to experienced educators, and lower likelihood of access to rigorous coursework.\nThere is disagreement in the research and policy worlds about why certain groups of students are arrested at higher rates. Differences in local approaches to school safety and in exposure to out-of-school factors such as poverty and crime are among the reasons cited.\nBut civil rights advocates say students of color often bear the brunt of overly punitive zero-tolerance policies and state laws that can lead to arrests for relatively minor misbehavior, such as vandalism or classroom arguments.\nAnd the presence of police in schools, such advocates say, makes arrests and referrals more likely, with results that can derail students’ lives.\n“Far too often when police are consistently present in black and brown communities, they criminalize behavior they wouldn’t in other places,” said Allison Brown, the executive director of the Communities for Just Schools Fund and a former lawyer for the U.S. Department of Justice.\n“Especially for young people, that is just devastating to their chances for success,” she said.\nA new era for school policing\nOverall, student arrest and referral rates are relatively low compared to other forms of school discipline. Education Week’s analysis found that the arrests documented in 2013-14 represent less than one-tenth of a percent of students nationwide. In the same year, schools reported 223,000 referrals. The federal data do not specify why students were arrested or referred to law enforcement.\nThe findings come as debates about the role of police in schools—and communities—enter a new era.\nWhile some civil rights and student groups argue that police don’t belong in schools at all, some school leaders, parents and police groups say they are necessary for security. Problems, they argue, can be avoided through proper hiring and training practices for school-based officers.\nIn the 2013-14 school year, schools reported 44,000 part-time and full-time onsite law enforcement officers, according to federal data. Researchers say the presence of officers in schools has increased in the wake of high-profile shootings—such as those at Columbine High School in Colorado and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut—that stoked widespread public fears.\nAmong 90,000 public schools, 29 percent reported at least one law-enforcement officer in 2013-14, Education Week’s analysis showed. That includes 46 percent of high schools, 42 percent of middle schools, and 18 percent of elementary schools.\nVery little is known about school resource officers, typically the label given to police who work in schools—such as their backgrounds, their training, and the policies that govern their interactions with students. Only 12 states require specialized training for officers who work the school beat, according to a 2015 study by the American Institutes for Research.\nAgainst that backdrop, President Barack Obama’s administration used its megaphone to draw attention to concerns that had guided the work of advocates at the state and local levels for years. The Obama administration attached new strings to federal grants used to hire school police—requiring schools to clearly define when officers should intervene with students and to set training requirements.\nThe U.S. Departments of Education and Justice delivered in 2014 their strongest message about what activists call the “school-to-prison pipeline.” The agencies put schools on notice that their discipline policies and practices may violate federal civil rights laws if they lead to disproportionately high rates of arrests or suspensions for some racial groups, even if those policies weren’t written with discriminatory intent.\nAnd districts must ensure that school-based officers don’t violate students’ civil rights—whether they are employed directly by the district or contracted through local police, the agencies said.\n“A routine school disciplinary infraction should land a student in the principal’s office, not in a police precinct,” then-Attorney General Eric Holder said.\nConservative federal lawmakers pushed back against those warnings, however, saying that stance would force schools to avoid disciplining some students.\nBefore the public has had the chance to see whether those efforts—and parallel efforts in states and districts—have eased disproportionate discipline rates, President Donald Trump’s administration will begin implementing policies of its own. Trump’s team of advisers and Cabinet nominees have signaled plans to roll back the aggressive civil rights stance of the Obama years.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump, who pledged to be a “law and order president,” singled out largely black communities as dysfunctional and unsafe and cited school shootings as a reason to ease gun restrictions and increase security in schools. And in his first week in office, he seems intent on carrying out that pledge. The White House website includes an issue page on “standing up for our law enforcement community” that says: “The dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America is wrong. The Trump Administration will end it.”\nTrump’s education advisers have suggested the new administration will scale back the Education Department’s office for civil rights, which led much of the Obama administration’s work on intervening in districts with uneven discipline rates.\nDebates over police in schools have run parallel to those about police on the street: In both settings, cellphone videos of violent encounters have spread quickly on the internet and fueled controversy.\nPolice shooting deaths of African-Americans, most of them unarmed, in communities across the country set off national protests and spawned a new movement of civil rights activism calling for dramatic changes to law enforcement and criminal justice. That movement helped accelerate momentum for changes to school discipline and safety.\nBut since Trump was elected, advocates have grown concerned about other issues, like climate change, said Phillip Goff, the president of the Center for Policing Equity at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n“On Nov. 9, policing in general went from the number-one domestic policy issue in the United States to the number-five issue overnight,” he said.\nThe federal data used in Education Week’s analysis was collected from nearly every public school in the country a few months before Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was shot and killed by a white police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri.\nThat encounter thrust into the broader public consciousness long-held concerns and anger in black communities about racial bias and inequities in policing and other institutions.\nSimilarly, scrutiny of the role of police in schools has accelerated since the public watched bystander videos that showed a South Carolina school resource officer dragging a girl from her desk after she refused to surrender a cellphone; a Baltimore officer who kicked and slapped a student accused of trespassing; and other hastily captured images of black and Hispanic students who were tackled, pinned down and arrested at school, sometimes for minor offenses.\nBlack students more likely to be in schools with police\nOther high-profile incidents that weren’t caught on video have also heightened concerns about unjust or overzealous policing of students.\nIn Prince William County, Virginia, a 14-year-old boy was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and petty larceny last fall after a school-based officer accused him of stealing a carton of milk. The boy, who qualified for free lunches, said he had gone back to the cafeteria cooler to get the milk after he forgot to pick one up when he first went through the serving line.\nIn Kansas City, Mo., the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of the family of a 7-year-old boy who was handcuffed by a school resource officer for disrupting his elementary school. The boy was crying loudly in response to a bullying incident, the lawsuit said, and an officer handcuffed the boy when he refused to follow directions.\nIn Alabama, a federal judge said Birmingham school officers used unconstitutionally excessive force when they sprayed students who were not resisting arrest or posing a threat to others with a mix of pepper spray and tear gas at school. In one of those instances, an officer sprayed a pregnant student who was already restrained with handcuffs. The judge ruled that in some other incidents the pepper-spraying was justified.\nWhile violent interactions draw the most attention, advocates say their concerns about police in schools extend beyond those incidents and arrest rates, and into areas that data can’t quantify.\nMeasures like security cameras and police presence in schools have effects on students’ experiences that haven’t been fully documented, they say.\nAnd what federal data don’t show are the daily, incidental interactions between officers and students in hallways, at metal detectors at school entrances, and in searches of students’ bags and lockers, those groups say.\nThe data also don’t show what schools lose out on when they channel funds toward law enforcement that could be spent on school counselors, social workers, and other student-support measures, those groups say. For example, an analysis of the 2013-14 civil rights data by the Education Department found that 1.6 million students attended schools with police but no school counselors and that those students were more likely to be Hispanic or black.\nAnd, because students of color are more likely than their white peers to attend schools with on-site officers, policies related to those officers have become an equity issue, said Brown, of the Communities for Just Schools Fund.\nEducation Week’s data analysis found that 74 percent of black high school students attend a school with at least one on-site law enforcement officer, compared with 71 percent of both Hispanic and multiracial high school students, and 65 percent of both Asian and white high school students.\nThe disparity is more pronounced at the middle school level, where 59 percent of black students attend schools with law enforcement, compared with 49 percent of both Hispanic and multiracial students, 47 percent of white students, and 40 percent of Asian students.\nA 2016 study published in the Washington University Law Review found that students were more likely to be referred to law enforcement for offenses like threats, fights, vandalism and theft at schools with law-enforcement officers who were on site at least weekly. That remained true even after authors controlled for factors like state laws that require schools to report certain issues to law enforcement, levels of criminal activity and disorder, neighborhood crime, and demographic variables.\nSchool police need proper training\nSupporters of school police say the incidents documented in viral videos are outliers and don’t represent the behaviors of most school resource officers. They argue that proper training and better vetting of officers in the hiring process can prevent such incidents from occurring.\nSchools also need to set clear limits for officers on what types of incidents they can and can’t get involved with, said Mo Canady, the executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers, which provides officer training.\nNASRO has repeatedly taken the public position that officers should not be involved in school discipline. And racial and ethnic disparities in school arrest rates mirror disparities in law enforcement as a whole, the organization has said.\nLaw-enforcement agencies shouldn’t treat schools as a regular beat rotation without considering whether officers have the desire and knowledge to work in such a distinct setting, Canady said.\n“I don’t care where the officer is coming from,” he said. “They shouldn’t be placed in there just for the sake of having someone there. That’s a mistake.”\nThere’s a difference between a general law-enforcement officer who works in a school and a school resource officer who has received additional training to work with students, even though the term is often used colloquially to refer to all school-based officers, Canady said.\nNASRO’s training follows the “triad model,” which teaches officers how to serve in three roles in schools: as law-enforcement officials, as educators who teach students about subjects like the criminal-justice system or drug prevention, and as informal counselors and mentors for students. Such training is necessary, Canady said, to understand how students with disabilities interact with law enforcement, how to de-escalate conflict, and how teenagers’ brain development influences their behavior and impulse control.\nIn 2013, when Canady testified before a congressional committee after the Sandy Hook shootings, a lawmaker asked him if more schools should have school resource officers.\n“We’re not calling for more police in schools,” Canady said. “What we’re asking for are the ones who go into schools to be properly trained.”\nEducation Week Research Center intern Coral Flanagan contributed to this report.\nThis story was produced by Education Week, a nonprofit, independent news organization with comprehensive pre-K-12 news and analysis.

This year, there are 14 studies led by international scientists versus 12 led by U.S.-based research teams. That’s a big shift from just five years ago, when 15 studies in the “press program” were led by Americans versus nine by international researchers.\nSeveral of the studies on this weekend’s press program come from Europe and Canada, along with two from China.\nPresident Donald Trump has proposed cutting the NIH budget for 2018 from $31.8 billion to $26 billion, a decline that many worry would jeopardize the fight against cancer and other diseases. Those cuts include $1 billion less for the National Cancer Institute.\nOn its website, the NCI notes that its purchasing power already has declined by 25 percent since 2003, because its budget — while growing — hasn’t kept up with inflation. Congress gave the NCI nearly $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2017, an increase of $174.6 million over last year. The NCI also received $300 million for the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot through the 21st Century Cures Act in December 2016.\n“America may be losing its edge in medical research,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society. The brightest young scientists are having trouble finding funding for their research, leading them to look for jobs not at universities but at drug companies “or even Wall Street,” he said. “I fear we are losing a generation of young, talented biomedical scientists.”\n(Story continues below.)\nThe number of studies fully funded by the National Cancer Institute at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology — the world’s largest gathering of cancer researchers — has fallen 75 percent in the past decade.\nSome see America’s leading role in science as a point of national pride.\n“Do we want the U.S. to remain at the center of biomedical innovation, or do we want to cede that to China or other countries?” said Dr. Stephan Grupp, director of the Cancer Immunotherapy Frontier Program at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “If you don’t push to stay in front, you don’t stay in front.”\nBut more than pride is at stake.\nPublic funding is critical, because it allows researchers to answer questions that don’t interest drug companies, said Richard Schilsky, senior vice president and chief medical officer at ASCO.\nWhile drug companies fund studies that help them get their medications approved, they tend not to pay for studies that focus on cancer prevention, screening or quality of life, Schilsky said. The NIH also funds head-to-head comparisons of cancer drugs, which allow patients and doctors to select the most effective treatments.\n“If the NIH-funded studies continue to decline, we simply won’t get the answers that patients are looking for,” Schilsky said.\nWhile government research often addresses areas of greatest need, “industry research is geared toward marketable products,” Brawley said.\nTo help make up the deficit, the American Cancer Society will double its research budget to $240 million by 2021, Brawley said.\nBut Grupp notes that charities and the drug industry are often reluctant to cover the indirect costs of research, such as labs. Without steady, predictable support from government grants, Grupp said he wouldn’t “have a building to do my research in or a way to keep the lights on.”"},{"url":"http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/05/27/nonpartisan-redistricting-makes-fair-maps-saves-tax-dollars/348087001","title":"Column: Nonpartisan redistricting makes fair maps, saves tax dollars","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Post-Crescent Media","description":"Voters should 'have confidence that they are not being manipulated by politicians.'","date":"","full_text":"In a victory for voters last fall, a federal court ruled Wisconsin’s legislative districts unconstitutional and ordered the Wisconsin Legislature to redraw voting districts.\nWith the deadline for the new maps now just five months off, Attorney General Schimel has asked the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay of the requirement to draw new voting maps, saying that Wisconsin should not have to “invest the considerable time, effort and taxpayer resources” to comply with the order.\nActually, Wisconsin taxpayers have already “invested” more than $2.1 million to have the unconstitutional districts drawn in secret by a private law firm and then litigated through two lawsuits.\nThe costs continue to spiral now that the case is in the U.S. Supreme Court. We learned recently that taxpayers are on the hook for an additional $175,000 to have private law firms write amicus briefs defending the maps in the Supreme Court.\nMeanwhile our neighbors in Iowa have had a legislative agency draw their voting maps since the 1980s at a small fraction of what Wisconsin taxpayers have “invested.” The Iowa maps produced this way have not been challenged in the courts because they have not been drawn to favor one party or the other. This saves taxpayers millions of dollars.\nAs in Iowa, our state constitution gives the Legislature the responsibility of redistricting, which takes place every 10 years after the census. Unfortunately, when you have one-party rule, as was the case in Wisconsin in 2011, majority legislators get to “choose their voters” by drawing meandering district boundaries designed to include some voters and exclude others.\nThe Wisconsin Legislature should adopt a plan similar to that in Iowa. Further, lawmakers should apply the Iowa plan now to redraw the unconstitutional districts.\nThere are currently proposals before the Wisconsin Legislature, Senate Bill 13 and Assembly Bill 44, that would have our Legislative Reference Bureau, the nonpartisan service agency that drafts all legislation, to create new maps. The LRB would have to follow the usual districting criteria mandated by state and federal law, such as compactness, contiguity, respect for existing municipal boundaries, and non-dilution of minority voting power.\nThe plan also provides for public input, requiring the LRB to hold at least three public hearings about the plan and report on the hearings to the Legislature. The Legislature would then bring the redistricting bill to a vote shortly after receiving the report, with only corrective amendments allowed. If the initial plan is rejected, the agency must submit a second version in a timely manner. Again, the legislature votes, with only corrective amendments allowed.\nSince its creation in 1980, this process in Iowa has operated smoothly and with the support of both parties. Each decade the Legislature has enacted the first or second proposed plan. The result in Iowa is some of the most competitive districts in the nation. In Wisconsin, by contrast, none of our congressional districts are considered competitive, and Common Cause in Wisconsin reported in 2016 that just one in ten of our legislative districts could be considered competitive. That discourages good people from running for office and offers Wisconsin voters less choice on Election Day.\nProposals to adopt the Iowa plan have been introduced in the past three legislative sessions, but majority leaders in the Assembly and Senate have not even allowed a public hearing for these bills. These bills deserve a hearing and a vote.\nIt is high time for Wisconsin to adopt nonpartisan redistricting so that voters can have confidence that they are not being manipulated by politicians seeking an unfair partisan advantage. We encourage citizens to call their state representatives in support of SB13/AB44.\nAndrea Kaminski is executive director of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for informed and active participation in government.

In collaboration with our partners at Climate Desk, we took a look at what his administration has accomplished and what the implications are for climate change and the environment out West and across the country.\nThis article was originally published by the Mother Jones, and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk Collaboration.\nOn New Year’s Day in 1970, President Richard Nixon appeared in San Clemente, California, for the momentous signing of the National Environmental Policy Act — the congressional statute that formally recast the government’s role from conserving the wilderness to protecting the health of the environment and the general public. In the previous decade, rising unrest over the link between pollution and poor health — spurred forward by Rachel Carson’s groundbreaking 1962 exposé Silent Spring and Lady Bird Johnson’s beautification campaign — gave birth to a burgeoning environmental movement demanding strong and urgent action from the federal government. Nixon, who was largely indifferent to environmental issues but sensitive about his own popularity, succumbed to the public pressure.\nThere was no evidence of any indifference in San Clemente that day when he laid out his new vision for the decade: “The 1970s absolutely must be the years when America pays its debt to the past by reclaiming the purity of its air, its waters, and our living environment,” he said. “It is literally now or never.”\nIn the following months, the president moved quickly to fulfill his promise. In February, he rolled out an unprecedented 37-point plan on the environment; by April, he approved suggestions from the Advisory Council on Executive Organization to form an independent agency dedicated to enforcing environmental regulation. Whereas such enforcement responsibilities had previously been scattered across 15 other federal organizations — water pollution under the Department of Interior, air pollution and solid waste under the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and pesticides under the Department of Agriculture, to name a few — the Environmental Protection Agency would consolidate the authority over specific areas under one umbrella. After a summer of congressional hearings, the EPA became a government agency with its own member of the Cabinet. Part of its initial budget came from the other 15 agencies; a formal separate budget wasn’t established until January of the following year. Nixon appointed William D. Ruckelshaus, a 38-year-old moderate Republican and assistant attorney general plucked from the Department of Justice, to head the agency, which opened its doors on December 2.\nAs the Trump administration concludes its first 100 days in office against a backdrop of aggressive efforts to dismantle the EPA, it may seem difficult to imagine a golden era of environmental legislation, ushered in by a conservative Republican president with strong bipartisan and public support. Yet 47 years ago, within the first 100 days of the EPA, Ruckelshaus successfully established a sweeping anti-pollution vision and laid the groundwork for a sophisticated and effective regulatory framework. Looking back on the EPA’s origins and early successes is a reminder of how much the agency was able to achieve with an engaged and supportive administration, Congress, and public.\n“What defined EPA in its earliest days was less the need to define a regulatory agenda than a need to convey a sense of mission and purpose to the public, the states, and the regulated community,” Ruckelshaus recalled in a March 1988 EPA Journal article.\nThe 5,800-employee fledgling agency posed challenges in both internal cohesion and public credibility. To address the former, Ruckelshaus delegated the internal organization of the staff to his deputy and focused on clarifying exactly what the agency’s mission would be. After consulting his own staff and looking at two other agencies—NASA, which had a very narrowly defined goal (“let’s get to the moon in ten years”), and the Office of Equal Opportunity, which had a broad and amorphous goal (“let’s do something about poverty”)—he decided the EPA would be focused on pollution abatement, which was, in his words, “identifiable enough, understandable enough to let us know what we were doing.”\nHaving defined a sense of mission, Ruckelshaus then set about communicating it to the American people and other stakeholders. What he saw as the EPA’s “most important imperative” was to demonstrate its willingness “to respond to the legitimate demands of the people.” The public was predisposed to be distrustful of government-driven environmental regulation. Prior to the EPA, conflicts of interest riddled the regulatory process. The Department of Agriculture, for example, had been in charge of regulating pesticide use while also being required to promote agricultural production. Days after the EPA’s founding, a New York Times investigation revealed that the majority of the state air and water pollution control boards were staffed by industry representatives engaged in pollution activities.\nIn response to this atmosphere of mistrust, Ruckelshaus did not shy away from enforcement. A week after his confirmation, he filed suit against Atlanta, Detroit, and Cleveland for polluting their rivers in violation of water quality standards. (Similar suits against major industry players, including Armco Steel Company and Jones and Laughlin Steel Company, soon followed.) Less than a week after that, he established 10 regional EPA offices across the U.S. to engage more deeply in local environmental issues. “Those actions established EPA foresquare in front of the American people as an Agency committed to doing its job,” wrote Ruckelshaus in the EPA Journal.\nThe EPA also engaged in an aggressive regulatory agenda, according to a comprehensive review of the Federal Registers (the government’s official daily publication for rules, proposed rules, notices, and presidential documents) during its first 100 days. With a budget of $2.5 billion at the start of 1971, the agency was tasked with researching, standard-setting, monitoring and enforcing five environmental hazards: air and water pollution, solid waste disposal, radiation, and pesticides.\nLeading up to its 100th day, the focus was primarily on administering and enforcing the Clean Air Act of 1970, which was enacted on December 31 to strengthen government crackdown of air pollution from industry and motor vehicles. To do so, the agency began systematically delineating air quality control regions in each state in consultation with local authorities. They also set thresholds for six air pollutants, including sulfur oxides, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide, based on available scientific and medical data, and used them to develop fuel additive and emissions standards. Detailed diagrams and formulas accompanied each rule to demonstrate the methods for measuring ambient pollutant concentrations.\nAside from air quality regulation, the agency also set new standards for pesticides and food additives, initiated the process to ban DDT, and began rudimentary regulation of water pollution. Though the Clean Water Act wasn’t enacted until 1972, in 1970 the staff creatively repurposed the 1899 Refuse Act. The act was originally passed to prevent the industry from dumping debris into navigable waters but was revived to implement a permit program for restricting all forms of industrial water pollution.\nFinally, the EPA engaged in an intensive public education campaign to build awareness of and rally support for the agency. Ruckelshaus traveled to each regional office in his second two months in office to listen to the concerns of local policymakers and constituents and to talk with the press. He understood what constituted his agency’s lifeblood: The EPA “never would have been established had it not been for public demand,” he reflected in a 1993 oral history interview for the EPA’s archives. “Public opinion remains absolutely essential for anything to be done on behalf of the environment. Absent that, nothing will happen.”\nThe legacy of Ruckelshaus’ first 100 days laid the foundation for the agency’s growth and the subsequent passage of pivotal environmental legislation over the following years. During his tenure, he saw the enactment of the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, as well as the reauthorization of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Following his departure in 1973, the momentum continued with the passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974, the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1976, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in 1976, among others.\nA decade after stepping down, Ruckelshaus was asked by President Ronald Reagan to return. The first 28 months of the Reagan administration had proved disastrous for the EPA. Under Administrator Anne Gorsuch, the mother of recently confirmed Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, the agency suffered deep budget and staff cuts, scandals, investigations, and even a key official’s imprisonment—all of which triggered increasing public outrage. Ruckelshaus took over and revived the flagging organization.\nWhile the specifics clearly differ, the antipathy of the Trump administration to the EPA uncannily mirrors the attitudes that nearly brought the agency to its knees during Reagan administration. “The E.P.A.’s new administrator, Scott Pruitt, comes to his job with this historical backdrop,” Ruckelshaus wrote in a New York Times op-ed this March, after describing the agency’s disarray at the start of his second term.\n“The public will tolerate changes that allow the agency to meet its mandated goals more efficiently and effectively. They will not tolerate changes that threaten their health or the precious environment,” he cautioned. “These are the lessons President Reagan learned in 1983. We would all do well to heed them.”"},{"url":"http://buffalonews.com/2017/06/01/stanley-cup-way-nhl-combine-week-nears-end","title":"Stanley Cup on its way to Buffalo as NHL combine week nears end - The Buffalo News","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Buffalo News","description":"The Stanley Cup is coming.

Rather, it’s an example of Putin’s Russification of Eastern Europe.\nWhile the back-and-forth amused internet-goers and even sparked mainstream news coverage, it is important to understand how a fight over the nationality of a historical figure signifies a greater battle over Ukraine’s national character and sovereignty. Given mounting Russian efforts to expand its influence by interfering in the domestic affairs of sovereign countries, such as in recent US and European elections, it is crucial that the West is watchful of any attempt by Russia to disrespect the independence and right to self-determination of a sovereign state.\nIn a May 29 visit to France, Russian president Vladimir Putin praised the historical ties of the Russian and French people and referred to “Russian Anne”—a princess of Kievan Rus, the medieval empire located in part on what is now the territory of Ukraine—who became Queen of France in 1051. Although Putin described Queen Anne as Russian, Ukrainians view her as Ukrainian: She was born and raised in Kyiv, which is now the capital of Ukraine. And while 11th-century Kyiv was a bustling and cosmopolitan city—much like the Kyiv of today—Moscow did not even exist at that time.\nRussia is aiming to undermine the national sovereignty of the Ukrainian state by downplaying its distinctiveness from Russia. This strategy is deployed as part of a greater battle between those who want to see Ukraine remain within Russia’s orbit and those who believe Ukraine should develop closer ties to the European Union and NATO.\nBy diminishing the cultural boundaries between Russian and Ukraine, Putin seeks to diminish the physical boundary, too. Putin has played this game before. In his speech marking the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, Putin referred to Kyiv as the “mother of Russian cities,” stating that Kyivan Rus is the “common source” of Ukraine and Russia, who “cannot live without each other.” He praised the “overall basis of culture, civilization, and human values that unite the peoples of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.” As the separatist conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine, Putin and other Kremlin officials began referring to southeastern Ukraine as “New Russia.” By diminishing the boundaries that exist in the history, culture, and languages of the two nations, Russia seeks to diminish the importance of the physical boundary that exists between their countries. That, in turn, decreases the significance of Russia’s invasion of Crimea and the Donbas.\nEU member states have recently taken steps to reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine. The Dutch Senate approved the EU’s Association Agreement with Ukraine on May 30, thereby enabling ratification of that pact. This agreement, along with newly approved visa-free European travel for Ukrainians, will strengthen the partnership between Ukraine and the EU and make it harder for Russia to suck Ukraine into its sphere of influence.\nHowever, the US’s new Republican administration has been less supportive. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has alternately questioned and insisted on US support for sanctions. President Donald Trump reportedly told Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov that he has little personal interest in the future of Ukraine. Just last week, White House economic advisor Gary Cohn said “we don’t have a position” on sanctions, and then backtracked that statement.\nWith or without Washington’s backing, European leaders must continue to foster support for Ukrainian independence and self-determination. After all, the majority of Ukrainians desire a closer relationship with Europe: According to a July 2016 International Republican Institute survey, 54% of Ukrainians would like to join the EU, and more Ukrainians would vote to join NATO than not.\nIt is crucial to maintain public awareness of the many types of weapons Russia utilizes for influence—both hard and soft power. While the description of a monarch from 1,000 years ago may seem trivial, any attempt to paint Ukrainian history as Russian is a strategy of that war. As Russian tampering in recent elections has demonstrated, the Kremlin will use whatever tools it can to expand its power. By identifying, unveiling, and challenging these methods, the international community can strengthen the independence and stability of Ukraine and Eastern Europe.\nLearn how to write for Quartz Ideas.

To remain divorced under Afghanistan law, I had to do something that still makes me feel guilty.\nTarana, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy, is a 19-year-old woman living in Kabul, Afghanistan who recently divorced her husband and had an illegal abortion in secret. If authorities were to find out, she would either be fined or arrested.\nAbortion is illegal in Afghanistan — even in cases of rape or incest — except if the mother’s life is in danger or there is a risk of the child being born with severe disabilities. The country’s birth rate is 4.8 children per woman, which is the highest in Asia (though is significantly lower than it was under Taliban rule, when girls weren’t allowed to attend school). Birth control is not illegal in the Muslim-majority country, though it is taboo and often difficult to access.\nTarana told her story in Dari through a translator to Maija Liuhto.\nI was born during the last years of the Taliban rule. My family lived in Maidan Wardak, a province that is too dangerous to visit today. Taliban fighters are everywhere now. During those days, there was peace but women could not go to school or work. If a woman wanted to go outside, she had to wear a burka that covered her from head to toe and she had to be accompanied by a male chaperone.\nLuckily, the Taliban regime fell when I was three. We moved to Kabul and I was able to start school.\nAlthough my family was quite progressive when it came to women’s education, marrying someone of my own choice was out of question.\nMy family decided to marry me off when I was only 17 years old. The man was a 28-year-old uncle of a family friend. He wasn’t educated and was only a driver, whereas I had studied until the 12th grade. Our marriage ended up lasting only two years.\nBecause of our divorce, I was forced to do something I haven’t told anybody about.\nWhen I moved in with my in-laws, I started to face lots of problems with the family and my husband. My mother-in-law tried to interfere in every aspect of my life; she wouldn’t let me do what I wanted and tried to stop me from seeing my parents.\nAbout a year after getting married, I gave birth to a daughter. Usually the birth of a child is a happy occasion, but not in my case. A daughter was not what my in-laws and husband had expected — they wanted a son. They were incredibly sad and angry with me, especially my husband.\nFinally my mother-in-law started telling my husband to beat me. And he obeyed. He would beat me a lot, slapping me with his hands. One day, when my mother was able to come and visit me, my husband started beating me in front of her.\nThis is when I decided I wanted a divorce. At first, my husband and in-laws did not accept this. They said divorce is considered bad, and people would talk about them. I decided to go to the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission because I knew they would help me. Then I went to the police. After that I was able to get the divorce.\nLuckily, my parents supported me through all of this, which is not always the case in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, it was difficult for them to see me have to get divorced. But they knew it was not my fault — after all, they were the ones who had arranged this marriage.\nI moved back to my father’s home. My husband didn’t try to keep our daughter, so I was able to take her with me.\nAfter some time I realized I was pregnant. It was like a nightmare. I became extremely anxious.\nIn Islamic law, there is a period of three months a woman has to wait after separation to see if she is pregnant. If she is, the divorce is not valid; the woman will have to go back to her husband. But I didn’t want that. I simply couldn’t bear the thought of going back to my ex-husband.\nIn Kabul, every young girl knows about abortions, although they are illegal. All you need to do is find the right clinic. I went to a hospital, but they told me they wouldn’t perform an abortion. Then I remembered that the sister of one of my friends is a midwife. I decided to talk to her. I told her my story, but she tried really hard to convince me not to do it. She said, “You should keep your child,” but I told her it was not possible — I already had a daughter and no husband. How could I possibly afford to take care of another baby?\nShe finally accepted and took me to the private clinic where she works.\nSince I had already given birth to a child, I knew everything about these issues. The doctors there told me what to expect. They were really friendly to me. I didn’t feel bad or anything — all of this wasn’t that difficult for me, because I was ready to do anything to escape my desperate situation.\nBy that time I was about forty days pregnant, so they said there was no need for an operation. They gave me some medicine and told me I could go home. They said the pain I would experience would be the same as giving birth to a baby.\nThree hours after I got home, I saw the blood. I wasn’t scared because I knew what would happen. But it was really hard. I was in a lot of pain. The bleeding lasted fifty days. My stomach was hurting and became bloated.\nI told my family it was because I was on my period. I hadn’t said anything to them about being pregnant. To this day, no one knows about my abortion, except for my friend and her sister, the midwife. Sometimes I feel really guilty and sad. Everyone in Afghanistan thinks abortion is like murder. I also feel like I murdered my child. I feel like a criminal.\nBut now my life is much better than it was when I was married. I have started to sew clothes and now I’m able to earn my own money. I don’t think anyone would marry me anymore, because I already have a child from my previous marriage. She would be considered a burden, an extra mouth to feed. And most men don’t want to marry divorced women.\nIn any case, I never want to get married again. I have seen what married life is like.\nAlthough I feel bad about having had an abortion, I feel like I had no other option. And it was my right.\nThe Development Set is made possible by funding from the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation. We retain editorial independence.

It offers strategies for helping these students identify, consider, and enroll in “match” colleges — that is, selective colleges that are a good fit for students based on their academic profiles, financial considerations, and personal needs. Many of the suggestions in this guide are based on insights and lessons learned from the College Match Program, a pilot program that MDRC codeveloped with several partners and implemented in Chicago and New York City to address the problem of “undermatching,” or what happens when capable high school students enroll in colleges for which they are academically overqualified or do not apply to college at all.\nThe College Match Program placed “near-peer” advisers — trained advisers who are recent college graduates — in low-income high schools, where they delivered crucial information, supported students as they navigated the college and financial aid application process, and helped students and their parents make informed decisions about college selection and enrollment. Over a four-year period, the program served approximately 1,200 students.\nBased on encouraging outcomes from the Chicago and New York pilots, this publication distills some of the most important lessons from the College Match Program into a brief, practical guide to help educators explore ways to adopt a “match” approach in their own schools and communities. The key lessons of the College Match Program, which are reflected in this guide, are that students are willing to apply to selective colleges when:\nThey learn about the range of options available to them.\nThey engage in the planning process early enough to meet college and financial aid deadlines.\nThey receive guidance, support, and encouragement at all stages.\nInformed by those key lessons, the guide tracks the many steps in the college search, application, and selection process, suggesting ways to incorporate a match focus at each stage: creating a match culture, identifying match colleges, applying to match colleges, assessing the costs of various college options, selecting a college, and enrolling in college. Because many students question their ability to succeed academically or fit in socially at a selective college, and because they may hesitate to enroll even when they receive good advice and encouragement, the guide offers tips and strategies to help students build the confidence they need to pursue the best college education available to them. Each section also suggests tools and resources in the form of websites and printed materials that counselors, advisers, and students can use, as well as case studies to illustrate the experiences of College Match participants throughout the process.\nOnline Tools from MDRC:\nFull"},{"url":"http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/12/09/bullying-rates-higher-among-students-disabilities","title":"Guess Who Bullies at School Target the Most","author_text":null,"keywords":["Culture","Education"],"publication_text":"TakePart","description":"Sure, nerds are harassed, but they’re not the only ones.","date":"","full_text":"When it comes to bullies, stereotypes perpetuated by movies and television shows would have us believe the band geeks and mathletes are usually their targets. What the media fails to reflect, and what we often don’t realize, is that the group most likely to experience bullying is the “short-bus kids.”\nDespite various kindness campaigns and the Safe Schools Improvement Act, a new study from the University of Missouri showed that about 22 percent of children ages 12 to 18 have experienced bullying in school within the last month—and children diagnosed with disabilities are two to three times more likely to be bullied and harassed.\nRELATED: Students Are Most Likely to Be Bullied If They Live in These States\nThe study, Exploring the Involvement of Bullying Among Students With Disabilities Over Time, found children with a disability experience bullying at a higher rate than children without one. For the report, more than 6,500 children from grades three to 12 were surveyed over the course of three years, 16 percent of whom were identified as having learning disabilities, emotional disabilities, and autism spectrum disorders.\n“Two of the biggest predictors of bullying involvement for youth with disabilities are social and communicational skill deficits,” Chad Rose, a researcher involved in the study, told TakePart. “We recommend that schools screen for these deficits for both students with and without disabilities and provide targeted instruction in social and communication skills.”\nThe researchers also found that bullying tends to peak in third grade, decreases in middle school, and increases in high school. Although bullying of children with and without disabilities follows that trend, the rates for children with disabilities were consistently higher. Anti-bullying campaigns are often found on campuses, but the study suggests that children with disabilities are not developing the social skills needed to combat harassment as they progress in higher education.\n“The difference between students with and without disabilities on victimization never changed,” Rose said. “What that tells me is we’re not providing students with adequate response skills, especially students with disabilities. Every school, every parent, and every educator needs to work with their kids on three things: Kids need to know what to say, what to do, and who to tell.”\nRELATED: Here’s the One Thing That Makes a Kid More Likely to Be Bullied in School\nThe challenges students with disabilities face from bullying don’t stop in the classroom. Only 46 percent of adults with learning disabilities report being employed, with 67 percent earning $25,000 or less per year, according to the National Center for Learning Disabilities. Their probability of being incarcerated is also higher: As many as 70 percent of kids in the juvenile justice system are reported to have learning disabilities, a similar number to what the U.S. Department of Justice has found in the state prison population.\n“These students need more support, but also schools need to do a better job in terms of establishing a climate that reduces bullying for all students,” Rose said."},{"url":"http://www.newsminer.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/stupidity-on-stilts/article_7f212268-41be-11e7-b698-df933a97821d.html","title":"Stupidity on stilts","author_text":"Carl Benson/Fairbanks","keywords":["Letters To Editor"],"publication_text":"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner","description":"News-Miner letter to the editor:","date":"","full_text":"News-Miner letter to the editor:\nMay 18, 2017\nTo the editor: Since January, ads by Bob Gillam have quoted various political leaders about the danger of “restrictive tax rates.” He applies this idea to Alaska, where tax rates are certainly not restrictive — indeed, they are nonexistent.

Magazine","description":"","date":"","full_text":"In Espaillat, a rain-fed province on the northern edge of the Dominican Republic, Francisca “Fidelia” Rivas sits with glasses perched on the edge of her nose, folding bright green foil around small bars of chocolate. The 59-year-old grandmother of seven (and great-grandmother of one) is one of 36 women who started the small chocolate company Chojoba (a combination of the words “chocolate” and “Joba Arriba,” the town closest to the factory).\nWomen here do not typically work outside of the home, but as Rivas’ colleague Maria “Altagracia” Ortega explains, employment offers agency: “I want to bring money to the house so I can decide where it goes.” As the company’s vivacious saleswoman, Ortega co-founded Chojoba “to get more power and more income.” And because “we are in a cocoa zone, we didn’t have to look for it, it was already there.” Despite the abundance of cocoa, Rivas says, she and her friends didn’t know anyone making chocolate. “So we decided to do it ourselves.”\nRivas and Ortega are part of the growing trend to make chocolate closer to the places where its primary ingredient, cocoa, is grown.\nCocoa starts as cacao, a colorful pod that ripens to colors ranging from bright yellow to deep burgundy. The seeds are fermented, dried, and processed into cocoa, then chocolate. Cocoa trees grow in a thin equatorial band in places such as Ecuador, Peru, and Vietnam, but over 70 percent of production is in West Africa.\nThe economics of growing cocoa are hard. The majority of the crop is grown by subsistence farmers who earn about 5 to 7 cents for every dollar spent on chocolate, according to Antonie Fountain, managing director of the VOICE Network, which works on sustainability in cocoa. A new study by the French Development Agency and Barry Callebaut—the world’s largest cocoa and chocolate manufacturer—found that cocoa farmers in Cote d'Ivoire earn about 91 cents per day.\nHistorically, dried cocoa beans are shipped out of their countries of origin to places like Europe and the United States, where they’re transformed into chocolate. This is where most of the money is made—and why farmers still struggle.\nAn analysis by economist Laurent Pipitone from the International Cocoa Organization shows that between 1990 and 2003, the price paid to cocoa farmers remained stable while the cost of chocolate in the United States doubled. On a global scale, cocoa was valued at $5.9 billion, but the chocolate confectionary market was valued at over $100 billion.\nThe shift toward making chocolate closer to the places where cocoa is cultivated may help narrow this gap.\nHowever, there are still technical and cultural hurdles. Many of the areas where cocoa grows lack adequate infrastructure. The poor roads, limited access to equipment, and sporadic electricity, combined with high temperatures, make it harder to produce and transport chocolate. In addition, places such as West Africa and Asia don’t have a culinary tradition of consuming chocolate, and they tend to perceive Western goods as superior to ones made locally.\n“Our cultural traditions are steeped in cacao, and yet as a country we never made any chocolate beyond drinking chocolates,” explains Carlos Mann, founder of Chocolate Momotombo in Managua, Nicaragua. “All of our eating chocolates were imported, mostly from the United States. We decided to make our own because Nicaragua needs to participate in the magic that is working with chocolate. … We have incredible cacao, and so we must make chocolate.”\nAnd chocolate bars aren’t the only product, says Brigitte Laliberté, a scientist and conservationist who coordinates the Cocoa of Excellence Programme, which rewards farmers for growing high-quality cacao: “A lot of value can be added to the product from the bean up.” That includes cocoa powder, cocoa butter and, with air conditioning in every supermarket and every corner shop, chocolates confections.\nThis value isn’t limited to earnings, Gillian Goddard explains on The Slow Melt podcast, but also status.\nGoddard holds chocolate-making classes for farmers in Trinidad. Farmers receive about $8 a kilo (approximately 2 pounds) for fresh cocoa beans that once processed into chocolate, Goddard says, “works out to about $200 a kilo.” This impacts how these growers are perceived in the community: “It is a mind-blowing thing to see the difference in how they are treated if they’re engaging as chocolate makers compared to selling a raw material product. It’s not just about the money; it’s about adding value and quality of life in many different ways.”\nThis deepened connection to chocolate also helps farmers better understand how their efforts at selecting cacao plants and fermenting and drying cocoa impact the flavor of the final bar or confection—but the work is not without its challenges.\nThese difficulties vary across origins. For Carlos Eichenberger, founder of Danta Chocolate in Guatemala, the challenge is historical. “There has been a longstanding misconception that chocolate made locally was inferior to foreign-made,” he says. “And up until we opened Danta, this was accurate, as all of the local chocolatiers used imported chocolate. Local industrial producers were—and still are—making chocolate with substitute fats to reduce costs.”\nAlthough it has been a challenge for Eichenberger to grow his customer base, he believes “consumers now recognize that locally produced chocolate is as good as—or better than—European- or U.S.-made chocolate.”\nFor Chojoba in the Dominican Republic, the greatest barrier is gender bias. “When men come to the factory,” Ortega says, “they talk down to us and try to sell us bad cacao—the garbage.”\nRivas adds, “The men always get everything. We just want the same chance. We don’t have a big market, but as women we have faith that if we keep working, our product will be known.”\nTheir resolve has paid off: With distribution confirmed in Sosua and Rio San Juan and a small number of bars being sold abroad, the women are able to pay themselves for the first time in four years of operation.\nThe development of local markets is critical for the sustenance of the cocoa industry, Pipitone says, because consumption in the United States and Europe (where most chocolate is consumed) isn’t growing. By producing at origin, and building a local appetite for chocolate, Ortega and her colleagues keep more money in their local economies. And that could transform the cocoa industry in Cote d'Ivoire, which grows nearly half of the world’s cocoa.\nSuzanne Kabbani is one of several entrepreneurs in the country trying to strengthen the local sweet tooth through flavors Ivorians hold dear: “wood-fired or grilled coconut, cashew nut, or dried ginger—and chocolates with higher cocoa content are the flavors that work,” she says.\nKabbani launched her company, La Maison du Chocolat Ivorien, in Abidjan back in 2006. “It has been an uphill battle to have Ivorians accept the idea that the world’s leading cocoa producer could also produce a quality chocolate. But, this year, the data show that more Ivorians consume chocolate—and especially that of their own country.”\nThe chocolatier believes this combination of local cultivation, creation, and consumption is a significant step toward self-determination: “We in Cote d’Ivoire will consume our own chocolate first, and then sell the rest of it as we want. Then, no one can impose a price on us. Our land will become richer and our farmers will have a better life.”"},{"url":"http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Autopsy-Drugs-taken-by-Chris-Cornell-didn-t-11192413.php","title":"Autopsy: Drugs taken by Chris Cornell didn't cause death","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"SFGate","description":"DETROIT (AP) — Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell had drugs in his body, including an anti-anxiety medication, but they didn't contribute to his death by hanging in a Detroit hotel room, according to autopsy reports released Friday.

Patel","keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"A rapidly advancing crack in Antarctica’s fourth-largest ice shelf has scientists concerned about a full break.","date":"2017-06-09","full_text":"A rapidly advancing crack in Antarctica’s fourth-largest ice shelf is getting close to a full break, according to scientists. It has accelerated this year in an area already threatened by warming temperatures, and is now only about eight miles from the edge of the ice shelf.\nThe crack in Larsen C is more than 120 miles long, and some parts of it are as wide as two miles.\nOnce the crack reaches all the way across the ice shelf, it will create one of the largest icebergs ever recorded, according to Project Midas, a research team from Swansea University and Aberystwyth University that has been monitoring the rift since 2014.\nBecause of the amount of stress the crack is placing on the remaining eight miles of the shelf, the team expects the break to happen soon.\nThe glaciologist Eric J. Rignot, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, and a senior scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, says the rift’s recent turn toward the shelf is a strong sign of when the full break could occur.\n“In my experience, when the rift takes a 90 degree turn like this is, it will happen in the next few weeks, no more than that,” he said.\nThe time-lapse image below shows the rift gradually widening from late 2014 to January of this year.\nIce shelves, which form through runoff from glaciers, float in water and provide structural support to the glaciers that rest on land. When an ice shelf collapses, the glaciers behind it can accelerate toward the ocean. Higher temperatures in the region are hastening the ice shelf’s retreat.\nIf it breaks at the crack, Larsen C will be at its smallest size ever recorded.\nThe ice front would also be left much closer to the ice shelf’s compressive arch, a line that scientists say is critical for structural support. If the front retreats past that line, the northernmost part of the shelf could collapse within months. It could also significantly change the landscape of the Antarctic peninsula.\n“At that point in time, the glaciers will react,” Dr. Rignot said. “If the ice shelf breaks apart, it will remove a buttressing force on the glaciers that flow into it. The glaciers will feel less resistance to flow, effectively removing a cork in front of them.”\nThe crack in Larsen C is a third of a mile deep, down to the floor of the ice shelf.\nScientists fear that two crucial\nanchor points will be lost.\nAccording to Dr. Rignot, the stability of the whole ice shelf is threatened.\n“You have these two anchors on the side of Larsen C that play a critical role in holding the ice shelf where it is,” he said. “If the shelf is getting thinner, it will be more breakable, and it will lose contact with the ice rises.”\nIce rises are islands overridden by the ice shelf, allowing them to shoulder more of the weight of the shelf. Scientists have yet to determine the extent of thinning around the Bawden and Gipps ice rises, though Dr. Rignot noted that the Bawden ice rise was much more vulnerable.\n“We’re not even sure how it’s hanging on there,” he said. “But if you take away Bawden, the whole shelf will feel it.”\nThe collapse of the Larsen C ice\nshelf may not significantly affect\nglobal sea level rise, but the collapse\nof other vulnerable ice shelves will.\nThe Larsen A and B ice shelves — both much smaller than Larsen C — disintegrated in 1995 and 2002. Neither contributed significantly to global sea level rise, however, because they were already floating above water, and the glaciers behind them did not contain a substantial volume of ice.\nAccording to Dr. Rignot, the collapse of Larsen C would add only a tiny amount of water to the global sea level. Of greater concern to scientists is how the collapse of ice shelves can affect the glaciers that flow behind them, because the melting of those glaciers can cause much greater increases in sea level. Scientists see the impending Larsen C collapse as a warning that far larger amounts of ice in West Antarctica could be vulnerable.\n“I think of the Larsen C as a natural laboratory that almost lets us do an experiment on an ice shelf,” said Thomas P. Wagner, who runs NASA’s effort to study the polar regions. “When it breaks, what the heck happens next?\""},{"url":"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2016/01/15/few-doctors-are-willing-able-to-prescribe-powerful-anti-addiction-drugs","title":"Few Doctors Are Willing, Able to Prescribe Powerful Anti-Addiction Drugs","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"More than 900,000 U.S. physicians are allowed to write prescriptions for painkillers such as OxyContin, Percocet and Vicodin.

","date":"","full_text":"DEADLY BIAS: Why Medication Isn’t Reaching the Addicts Who Need It, Part III\nSAN FRANCISCO — Dr. Kelly Eagen witnesses the ravages of drug abuse every day. As a primary care physician at a public health clinic here in the Tenderloin, she sees many of the city’s most vulnerable residents.\nMost are homeless. Many suffer from mental illness or are substance abusers. For those addicted to opioid painkillers or heroin, buprenorphine is a lifesaver, Eagen said. By eliminating physical withdrawal symptoms and obsessive drug cravings, it allows her patients to pull their lives together and learn how to live without drugs.\nClinical studies show that U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved opioid addiction medicines like buprenorphine offer a far greater chance of recovery than treatments that don’t involve medication, including 12-step programs and residential stays.\nBut as the country’s opioid epidemic kills more and more Americans, some of the hardest-hit communities across the country don’t have enough doctors who are able — or willing — to supply those medications to the growing number of addicts who need them.\nMore than 900,000 U.S. physicians can write prescriptions for painkillers such as OxyContin, Percocet and Vicodin. But because of a federal law, fewer than 32,000 doctors are authorized to prescribe buprenorphine to people who become addicted to those and other opioids. Most doctors with a license to prescribe buprenorphine seldom — if ever — use it.\nBuprenorphine is the primary addiction treatment tool for Eagen and the seven other staff physicians at the Tom Waddell Urban Health Clinic.\nGetting patients started on the medication can be time-consuming. When they’re too busy with other patients, they rely on a small medical team at a county-funded center in the nearby Mission District to screen patients and, if the medication is appropriate for them, determine the correct dose.\nAt this central “induction center” on Howard Street, a half-time doctor, two nurse practitioners, a behavioral health counselor and two administrators have been providing screening and initial care for low-income opioid and heroin addicts since 2003.\nEagen said working with the Howard Street team makes her life easier. “When the patient is handed back to me, I know that the person is not at risk for imminent relapse. They’re the easiest patients I have.”\nUnrealized Potential\nWith its long history of providing drug treatment and free health care to uninsured residents, San Francisco is particularly well-equipped to battle the opioid and heroin epidemic. But even here, federal prescribing restrictions and lack of information keeps many doctors from entering the fray.\nWhen the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded the research that led to buprenorphine’s development more than a decade ago, it hoped that office-based prescribing of buprenorphine, which comes in a soft tablet and dissolvable film, would mean greater access to addiction medication nationwide.\nIt hasn’t happened. Most doctors claim they don’t have the training or the time to treat high-maintenance opioid addicts in their busy practices, despite urgent calls from federal and state officials. “I really think doctors are scared of prescribing it,” Eagen said. “They worry they’re going to make people sick when they start taking it.”\nBut an increasing number of physicians are starting to push for greater use of buprenorphine.\n“We doctors are the ones who caused this epidemic by overprescribing pain medications. We need to get more involved in fixing it,” said Kelly Pfeifer, a physician with the California HealthCare Foundation, which advocates for greater availability of addiction treatment and prevention.\nNationwide, about 21.5 million people 12 and older, or 8 percent, had some kind of substance use disorder in the past year, according to a national survey by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Of those, almost one in 10 were hooked on painkillers — 1.9 million — and more than half a million were hooked on heroin. And those numbers are rising. Among the low-income adult population served by Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the rate is much higher: An estimated 13 percent of newly eligible Medicaid enrollees suffer from addiction.\nIn California, which was among the first states to expand Medicaid, as many as 370,000, of the 2.9 million people newly eligible for Medicaid, may be in need of treatment.\nUnder a first-of-its-kind agreement with the federal government, California’s county-run Medicaid programs are slated to begin covering a full set of addiction treatment options recommended by the American Society of Addiction Medicine, including opioid addiction medications. San Francisco County and the rest of the Bay Area will be the first to roll out the new drug treatment benefits later this year.\nFederal Rules\nThree medications have been approved to treat opioid and heroin addiction. Methadone, a long-acting opioid that fulfills the addicted brain’s perceived need for heroin, was approved for treatment in 1964 and is dispensed at highly regulated clinics scattered around the country, mostly in urban areas.\nPatients must visit the clinics daily to swallow a liquid dose of methadone under supervision of a certified health professional. For many, that means traveling substantial distances early in the morning before work. Some patients can qualify for take-home doses for use on weekends.\nNaltrexone, a daily pill approved in 1984 for heroin addiction, can also be prescribed by a doctor. But until 2010, when naltrexone was introduced in injectable form, as Vivitrol, it was considered much less effective than either methadone or buprenorphine at keeping people in recovery from heroin addiction.\nBuprenorphine, approved in 2002, is prescribed by doctors in an office setting, making it much more convenient than methadone. Patients simply pick up a monthly supply of the medication and take it on their own. Like methadone, it is a long-acting opioid that relieves drug cravings and physical withdrawal symptoms with fewer of the side effects of other opioids.\nIn anticipation of buprenorphine’s approval, a 2000 federal law required doctors to seek a special license from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to prescribe it. The federal law requires eight hours of training and limits the number of patients per doctor to 30 in the first year and 100 in subsequent years. That limit was established to prevent “pill mills,” in which doctors prescribe the medication for a fee without ensuring that patients are actually using the pills to stay in recovery from a drug addiction.\nAlthough the vast majority of doctors with a buprenorphine license see only a few patients, the federal limit prevents some doctors in high-demand communities and urban neighborhoods from providing care to everyone in need.\nIn response to the worsening heroin and opioid epidemic, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is considering an increase in the patient limit for prescribing buprenorphine. Advocates for greater availability of addiction medicines argue HHS should go further, eliminating the cap altogether and allowing nurse practicioners and physician assistants to prescribe the medication.\nBut the federal government argues that without adequate record keeping and physician oversight, too many patients could end up selling the medication on the street.\nAlthough buprenorphine does not produce the euphoric effects of heroin, many drug users purchase it to tide themselves over until they can score the real thing. Doctors who advocate for greater use of buprenorphine argue that the threat of diversion is minor compared to the lifesaving potential of the drug.\n'Summer of Love'\nBuprenorphine doesn’t just save lives by fighting addiction, advocates say. It also connects drug addicts to mainstream medical care and can help improve their health, which drug users typically neglect.\nDr. David Smith, a San Francisco physician credited with starting the first free health clinic in the country, in 1967, argues that in the long run, patients are better off in the care of physicians than addiction treatment providers, such as counselors and therapists, without medical training.\n“We’re finding that when people with addictions start going to a primary care doctor, their physical health starts to improve, too. They start getting regular treatment for diabetes, infections and heart disease, for example,” Smith said. “They tend to stay in treatment longer and their outcomes tend to be much better.”\nSmith, who runs a private addiction practice here, treated young middle-class kids who flocked to the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood during the “Summer of Love,” in 1967, to experiment with drugs. Many were dying of overdoses and nearly all of them were neglecting their health, he said.\n“I came to a realization back then that health care was a right, not a privilege, and I’ve never changed my thinking,” Smith said. Hundreds of other doctors came to the same realization in the 1980s, when the city became ground zero in the AIDS epidemic.\nThen in the 1990s, heroin returned and doctors realized that intravenous drug users were getting HIV. “People were dying all over the city,” said Dr. Judith Martin, medical director for substance abuse services at the San Francisco Department of Public Health.\nMany of San Francisco’s doctors began embracing methadone, the only addiction medication back then, Martin said. Addicts who showed up at clinics to get their daily cup of methadone weren’t dying of overdoses and they weren’t contracting AIDS. As a result, Martin said, the department’s doctors are believers in addiction medicines and they’re committed to fighting the disease.\nAs soon as buprenorphine was approved, the department asked all of its doctors to apply for federal permission to prescribe it, and nearly all did. They were eager to help. But the prospect of fitting droves of drug-addicted new patients into their busy practices worried them.\nSo in 2003 the department and San Francisco General Hospital teamed up to make it easier for doctors to work with patients fighting addiction. At a cost of about $1 million per year in general tax revenue, more than 1,300 addicts have passed through the Howard Street doors and on to the care of doctors elsewhere in the city.\nOnce the clinic transfers patients to a primary care provider, they are removed from the rolls, allowing Howard Street’s lone doctor to keep initiating people on buprenorphine without exceeding her 100-patient limit.\nSan Francisco has seven methadone clinics, more than most cities its size. It also has two mobile clinics that travel to underserved neighborhoods and the jail. Three primary care sites and two pharmacies are also licensed to distribute methadone.\nGetting Started\nOn a rainy Monday morning earlier this month, four of the eight patients in Howard Street’s Spartan waiting area sat uncomfortably on metal chairs looking like they had the flu. They were the ones scheduled to receive their first dose of buprenorphine. A handful of other patients looked much happier. They were the ones who had gotten through the rough part.\nFor patients who decide to quit opioids or heroin and get on buprenorphine, the first step is to stop using drugs for at least 12 hours or until they start having at least moderate withdrawal symptoms — chills, fever, body aches, watery eyes and restlessness.\nThat’s what they’re told when they walk in to the center on the ground floor not far from the city’s financial district, in the same building as the Department of Public Health’s mental health and residential substance abuse branch. From the Tenderloin, it’s a short walk downhill.\nPatients come on their own to sign up or get referred here by a primary care doctor, a county jail or a hospital. Many want to try buprenorphine but don’t know what to expect. Some are on their second or third try at sobriety.\nThe first visit takes at least two hours, sometimes more, and patients are almost always filled with anxiety, said Jadine Cehand, the nurse practitioner on duty. Many are ambivalent about their decision to quit, she said. Nearly all patients are fearful of what lies ahead. “We keep telling them that they’re doing the right thing,” she said.\nAfter the first day, patients take a dose or two of the medication home with them and come back every morning for the rest of the week to report their symptoms and get another dose.

Now its government has given the green light to use a new Ebola vaccine.","date":"","full_text":"When Ebola erupted in West Africa a few years ago, it was catastrophic.\nBut one good thing emerged from the outbreak: The development of an Ebola vaccine— a powerful vaccine.\nAs we reported back in December, the vaccine is highly effective. \"We were able to estimate the efficacy of the vaccine as being 100 percent in a trial,\" said Ira Longini, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, who helped test the vaccine. \"It's very unusual to have a vaccine that protects people perfectly.\"\nOf course, no vaccine is perfect. In the end, the efficacy is likely to sit somewhere between about 70 percent and 100 percent, Longini said. And that's enough to bring outbreaks to a screeching halt.\nNow that vaccine is headed to the Democratic Republic of Congo to help fight a small outbreak there. Since late April, Congo has reported about 19 cases, the World Health Organization said.\nOn Monday, the Congo government agreed to use the vaccine.\n\"Now there's a Medecins Sans Frontiers team that is arriving [in Congo] today to validate the protocol with the technical teams,\" Jonathan Simba, a health ministry spokesman, told Reuters.\nThe outbreak already shows signs of slowing down. There hasn't been a new confirmed case since May 11. And several suspected cases were ruled out last week.\nCongo has a long history fighting Ebola. Since the virus was first detected there in 1976, the country has reported seven other outbreaks. In all instances, health workers have stopped the disease by isolating infected people. This is the first outbreak since the vaccine became available.\nThe vaccine — called rVSV-ZEBOV — took about two decades to develop. Scientists in the U.S. and Canada started working on it back in the 1990s and early 2000s. Then it sat on the shelf for years because of lack of funding.\nToward the end of the outbreak in West Africa, scientists began testing the vaccine in a large trial with more than 4,000 people. The shot worked extremely well and had mild side effects, such as headache and muscle pain.\nThe vaccine hasn't been approved yet by either the World Health Organization or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That's predicted to happen sometime in 2018.\nBut GAVI — the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization — has already spent $5 million to help finish the development and manufacturing of the vaccine, in partnership with the pharmaceutical company Merck.\nTogether, they have stockpiled 300,000 doses of the vaccine.

Insel, runner-trim, quietly alert, and constitutionally diplomatic, did not rant about this. It’s not in him. You won’t hear him trash-talk colleagues or critics.\nListen to the audio version of this article:\nDownload the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles.\nYet within the bounds of his unbroken civility, Insel began voicing something between a regret and an indictment. In writings and public talks, he lamented the pharmaceutical industry’s failure to develop effective new drugs for depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia; academic psychiatry’s overly cozy relationship with Big Pharma; and the paucity of treatments produced by the billions of dollars the NIMH had spent during his tenure. He blogged about the failure of psychiatry’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to provide a productive theoretical basis for research, then had the NIMH ditch the DSM altogether—a decision that roiled the psychiatric establishment. Perhaps most startling, he began opening public talks by showing charts that revealed psychiatry as an underachieving laggard: While medical advances in the previous half century had reduced mortality rates from childhood leukemia, heart disease, and aids by 50 percent or more, they had failed to reduce suicide or disability from depression or schizophrenia.\n“You’ll think that I probably ought to be fired,” he would tell audiences, “and I can certainly understand that.”\nIt was unsettling—as if the kindly captain of the world’s biggest ocean liner had sat down with his guests at dinner one evening and told them that their ship was unexpectedly lost and, if the crew could not soon correct course, they might well run aground, founder, and die.\nAround this time, Insel told me recently, he’d just finished a talk describing the wonderful things the NIMH was discovering about the brain when a man in the audience said, “You don’t get it.”\n“You’ll think that I probably ought to be fired,” Insel would tell audiences, after explaining the paltry progress in treating the mentally ill, “and I can certainly understand that.”\n“Excuse me?,” Insel said. “I don’t get what?”\n“Our house is on fire,” the man said, “and you’re telling us about the chemistry of the paint. We need someone to focus on the fire.”\n“I heard that,” Insel told me. “I went home and thought, There’s truth to that. It’s not just that we don’t know enough. The gap between what we know and what we do is unacceptable.”\nFor decades, most psychiatric research, and the NIMH’s in particular, had followed leads—clues about the brain’s hidden connections, the genome’s elusive secrets—that took decades to pay off. It was necessary work. But it had done far too little for those who were ill today.\nNot long after that talk, at a conference in June 2015, Insel met Andy Conrad, who led Google’s new health spin-off, Verily. The two hit it off. That July, Insel visited Google’s Mountain View, California, headquarters. Conrad asked him: How would you like to run Verily’s new mental-health team? Instead of focusing on connections among neurons and genes, how about focusing on the connections between people that Google can track, analyze, and organize—the signals flashing across our world’s digital synapses—to better understand and treat mental illness?\nInsel was in his mid-60s. Many people would have been thinking about retirement. But five months later, he had traded a kingdom of some 3,000 NIMH-funded researchers for a staff of one assistant, and he began working out of Google’s headquarters. He found in California’s digital culture a freedom he could previously only dream of.\n“We are wildly ambitious,” he says. Insel hopes to use data—especially the rich, ongoing streams of data that a smartphone can provide—to detect a deteriorating state of mind faster and more reliably than we can now, and then to respond and turn things around more quickly. He believes a smartphone can be both a diagnostic instrument and, through the links it gives us to others, a life-saving mode of connection and treatment.\nAt any given moment, roughly one in seven of the world’s 7.5 billion people is struggling with mental illness. “We’re not going to reach all those people by hiring more psychiatrists,” says Insel. But we might reach them with smartphones.\nInsel believes that a smartphone can be both a diagnostic instrument—it can detect a deteriorating state of mind—and a life-saving mode of treatment.\nAlready, some 5 billion people worldwide have mobile phones. By 2020, it’s expected that 6 billion will use smartphones with the capability of capturing mental-health data and apps that can provide a form of treatment.\nInsel wants to make those phones the central hub in a new way of delivering mental-health care. Former longtime colleagues speak of him the way baseball players speak of an ace pitcher who just signed with a rising franchise: I’m eager to see what he does.\nThings always seemed to come easy to Tom Insel. His father, H. Herbert Insel, an eye surgeon in Dayton, Ohio, told him and his three brothers that they could do anything they wanted to as long as they became doctors first. As the youngest, Insel says, “I learned early on that the path to success was finding something others weren’t into.” He found his first niche outdoors, collecting crawly things that he kept in the basement. He did so well in school that when he was 15, he left high school and—without a diploma—entered a six-year B.A./M.D. program at Boston University.\nThen, at 17, he did something that announced a pattern: Moving smoothly along an enviable track, he jumped off of it. With his bachelor’s work done and med school waiting for him, he got a year’s leave from the university; married his college girlfriend, Deborah Silber; and took off. They spent the 1969–70 school year skirting the Vietnam War, alternating stints of service work (a Hong Kong tuberculosis clinic for boat people; a Mennonite hospital in India) with travel around Nepal, Cambodia, and Thailand. Then he returned to Massachusetts, finished medical school and a year-long internship, took another year off to travel and study philosophy, and spent another three years in a psychiatry residency at UC San Francisco. After that, he presented himself, at age 27, for employment at the massive National Institute of Mental Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland.\nWorking in Bethesda as a research psychiatrist—increasingly studying patients, rather than treating them—Insel soon made a mark by running a drug trial that helped turn psychiatry away from talk therapy and toward chemistry. The trial showed that the antidepressant clomipramine helped people with obsessive-compulsive disorder faster and in more cases than psychoanalysis or standard talk therapy did. Today such a finding would go unnoticed. But this was the early 1980s, before Prozac and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors took over the world. At the time, OCD was seen as “the classic neurotic illness,” Insel recalls, Freudian anxiety run amok—“the prototype of what you got psychoanalysis for.” Yet Insel’s trial showed that a drug worked better and faster.\nThe papers Insel and others wrote about clomipramine over the next few years “really launched the field” of using antidepressants to treat OCD, he says, and helped pave the way for the Prozac era.\nThis irked some people. Freud may have been going out of fashion, but he still dominated psychiatry. His followers did not like losing to molecules. Insel hadn’t meant to stoke controversy. He liked Freud. That the drug became part of this turf war surprised him.\nBut as he followed up with other papers on the neurobiology of OCD, he soon found himself a leader in anti-anxiety-drug research. At 30, just three years into the job, he had his own research unit. “I could have just done drug trials for the next 20 years,” he says, “become a full professor, spent my time giving lectures and doing drug-company gigs.” Instead, he jumped the track. He closed his lab in Bethesda to study neuroscience at Johns Hopkins for a year, then returned to the NIMH. But rather than going back to Bethesda, he went to the sticks to work with one of the oddest people in neuroscience.\nSurrounded by farm country, the National Institutes of Health’s facility outside of Poolesville—a scattered collection of low-slung labs, barns, and bare-bones offices an hour from Bethesda—was lonesome in a way that’s hard to find in Maryland. Even today, one route between there and D.C. involves a cable-guided ferry that crosses at a languid pace. It was sleepy. “I needed that,” Insel says. “I needed a place where nobody was around.”\nThe man he joined there, a renowned neuroanatomist named Paul MacLean, was, Insel says, “from another era.” MacLean, who died in 2007, had studied English literature at Yale and chemistry and physics in Edinburgh, Scotland, before getting an M.D. back at Yale in 1940. He loved brains. His lab was stuffed with drawers holding hundreds of micro-thin cortical cross sections, and with shelves holding “jars of formaldehyde,” Insel says, “with—I’m not making this up—roadkill.” Whenever MacLean came across something dead on the road, he’d put the carcass in his trunk and drive it to the lab. The idea was that one of his technicians would saw open the animal’s skull, snip its brain free of its spinal cord, and slice, stain, and mount some brain cross sections onto slides. MacLean would then compare the brain’s structure with that of other roadkill. He didn’t much care what kind. “He just wanted to see how, say, the hippocampus of a deer differed from that of a possum.”\nWhen one member of a prairie-vole pair dies, the survivor generally foreswears all other voles. Insel discovered the neurochemical reason for this, laying bare the biology of behavior.\nMacLean named his lab the Laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior. “No commas,” notes Insel. “Syntax entirely unclear, so you could read or say it any way you wanted.” Insel had “almost complete freedom,” of a sort you can’t really get now.\nInsel’s landmark work was a run of vole studies that he started at Poolesville in the late 1980s.\nVoles are rodents, mouselike but rounder, that live in burrows. In the ’70s, an ecologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign named Lowell Getz was trapping small mammals in the Midwest for a population census. He kept catching one particular vole species—the prairie vole—in pairs. This was odd. Voles, like most rodents, generally show up in traps alone. But one out of 10 times that Getz caught a prairie vole, he caught a couple—a male and a female.\nIn a string of work requiring several years, much trapping, and many papers, Getz established that prairie voles were monogamous. This monogamy distinguished them from most of the other 150 vole species and, for that matter, about 95 percent of all other mammals. Most voles, for instance, mate and then stay together only minutes (or less) before moving on, and males pay little heed to their pups. But once a pair of prairie voles mates—an event typically triggered when a young female licks the urine of a male—they generally stick together till death. They cuddle and groom each other, and they cooperatively raise up to four litters a year. When one of the pair dies, the survivor generally foreswears all other voles.\nGetz and Sue Carter, a behavioral endocrinologist, had already identified some of the hormones that drove prairie-vole monogamy. Insel and his lab picked up this thread. In one experiment after another, they outlined the genetic, molecular, and neural mechanisms that led to the prairie vole’s distinctive family life. Collaborating first with Carter and then mostly with his own colleagues Zuoxin Wang and Larry Young, Insel eventually showed how certain genes made the prairie-vole brain especially sensitive to two hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin, that surged at key times in a vole couple’s romance. Their work got heavy, often breathless press, which dubbed oxytocin “the love hormone.”\nTheir best work was astoundingly clever. For instance, by finding ways to bypass or silence some of the genetic signals and neurochemical receptors involved in the voles’ behavior, Insel, Wang, and Young proved the function of those signals and receptors. They’d identify, say, a gene that coded for an oxytocin receptor in the brain and delete the gene in an animal. With the receptor gone, the bonding behavior would disappear. Thus they turned speculative hypotheses into demonstrated findings. They showed that one could lay bare the biology of behavior.\nThe vole work made the careers of Insel, Wang, and Young. It also helped psychiatry with two perennial problems tormenting the discipline.\nPsychiatry has always struggled to be taken seriously as a science. By the 1980s, the field seemed especially lost. Its best drugs were from the 1950s and ’60s. Most of its hospitals, their failings made infamous by works such as Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar and Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, had been closed. Talk therapy, which often works, but by psychobiological pathways painfully difficult to discern, was frequently lampooned.\nFor these and other reasons, including its penchant for savage infighting, psychiatry in the ’70s was “a collection of diverse cults rather than a medical science,” as Melvin Sabshin, a onetime medical director of the American Psychiatric Association, later put it.\nThe field was also trying to adjust to one of the 20th century’s long, slow pendulum swings between environmental and biological explanations for behavior. In the century’s opening years, behaviorism was dominant in the wider culture, casting environment as the key variable in how people behaved; change a person’s environment, it was argued, and you’ll usually change his or her behavior. By the 1930s, the new science of genetics had bolstered the view that genetic (and thus presumably innate) differences were a crucial variable. After the Nazis exploited this view to help justify murdering 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of people with mental illnesses, the pendulum swung back the other way, toward the notion that a stressful environment could create social, educational, and mental-health deficits. Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty funded studies on the environmental roots of crime, minority-group mental health, and urban discord.\nBy the 1980s, however, this emphasis on the environment had come to be seen as misguided and overdone. It became harder to attribute schizophrenia or autism to emotionally cool “refrigerator mothers,” or youth violence to poverty.\nThese forces, then—the pressure for credibility, the swing toward biology as destiny—encouraged psychiatric research to focus less on environment itself and more on the biological mechanisms that responded to it.\nInsel’s vole studies did precisely that. They were not the only works to do so, but they were among the earliest, cleanest, and most publicized. Beginning in the mid-’90s, Insel’s work took a place amid a handful of other new studies of social species, such as honeybees, songbirds, and cichlids (a fish), that showed how chains of neurobiological events produce fascinating and sometimes bizarre behaviors involving everything from mating and murder to language acquisition and social dominance. These studies did not really ignore environment. Rather, they explored the interplay of biology and environment by focusing on the former. And while these studies did not involve humans, they often explored humanlike behaviors.\nThese studies were exactly what psychiatry needed, offering to make it a discipline of numbers, mechanisms, circuits, and chemicals. The power of such work was almost certainly one reason Insel would later become the director of the NIMH. He came to represent a new way to explore behavior.\nBut first he had to get fired.\n“What’d you do?,” I asked Insel when he told me he got sacked.\n“It wasn’t what I did,” he said, smiling. “It was what I didn’t do”—focus directly on humans.\nWhen Insel started the vole work, in the late ’80s, the NIMH did not yet consider animal studies of basic behaviors likely to reveal much about human mental health. Insel’s decade of work on family and social bonds in animals had done little to change that. “You’re talking about why a mother rat takes care of its baby?” says his former colleague Larry Young. “It was too fluffy.” So in 1994, three years after Insel published his first vole paper, he got canned.\nGetting fired, Insel says, “was actually the best thing that ever happened to me.” It got him to see the importance of telling a clear story with his research, which proved essential in making that research successful. And it let him take another job that ultimately paved the way for his return to the NIMH as director.\nJust weeks before Insel got fired, the famed Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University had offered him an interview for the job of director. Insel, studying voles in Poolesville, figured he had no real shot at it. But by the time of the interview, he was newly fired, highly prepared, and keenly focused. He got the gig.\nInsel spent eight years at Emory. While there, he worked with Wang and Young to expand their vole research into the magnum opus it became.\nRunning the primate center, meanwhile, gave Insel “a chance,” he says, “to understand how to build programs, how to build institutions, how to mentor, how to help people grow within an institution.” His changes at Yerkes upset some primatologists and drove some of them away. Yet he managed to get people to follow him, says Young, “not by force, but by being a nice guy and instilling excitement in others.” Insel showed that he could take the helm of an institution and change its course without causing mutiny.\nIn his 13 years as the director of the NIMH, from 2002 to 2015, Insel would become one of the best-known directors the institute ever had. His renown came partly from the length of his tenure, second only to the 15-year run (1949–64) of the founding director, Robert Felix.\nWhen he became director, he took custody of a gluttonous giant that was being forced to diet. In the previous two decades, the institute’s budget had effectively tripled. But when Insel arrived, George W. Bush’s administration had just cut taxes and entered one war; it was preparing to enter another. Insel would work his entire tenure with an essentially flatlined budget—one in which, furthermore, 70 percent of each year’s expenditures was determined by prior commitments to ongoing programs.\nIf Insel wanted to change things, he would have to do so slowly, and he did. He devoted more research to the most-serious mental disorders, such as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Anticipating that pharmacology would produce few effective new psychiatric drugs, he cut NIMH involvement in drug trials. And when, in 2010, he decided that psychiatry’s official diagnostic categories in the DSM no longer served the NIMH’s needs well, he spoke against them. In 2013, he rejected the DSM as a research guide, even though doing so infuriated many in the psychiatric establishment.\nThroughout his tenure at the NIMH, Insel explicitly defined mental disorders as brain disorders. Critics of this approach expressed several complaints. Allen Frances is one of the world’s most prominent psychiatrists. He led an overhaul of the DSM in the early 1990s, producing its fourth edition, and has since become a vocal critic of psychiatry’s medicalization of normal distress, of its overuse of drugs—and of what he calls the NIMH’s overly brain-centric view of mental health.\n“I think very highly of Tom Insel,” Frances says. “Right motives, decent guy, very smart, honest. But what he did at NIMH is disastrous. He inherited an institution that was already moving to a narrow, bioreductionist view of mental illness, and he moved it even further.” The translational jump from basic science to treatment is big in most of medicine, Frances says, but it’s especially big in psychiatry because the brain is the most complicated thing in the known universe. “Tom was naive about that. It’s not clear that any one patient, even today, has been helped by the neuroscientific advances made under his tenure.”\nAlmost all medical research faces the same challenge: striking the right balance between basic research (how does this work?) and translational research that converts the basic findings into treatments (how can we make this work differently?). To Frances and many other critics, the NIMH had that balance wrong, focusing too heavily on basic neuroscience research.\nAnother criticism leveled by Frances and others is that defining mental disorders as brain disorders underplays what psychiatrists call the psychosocial nature of mental states and mental health—the countless dynamics in social relationships that affect our psyches. A reductive biological model arguably neglects, for instance, the growing evidence that social isolation aggravates mental illness, while social support ameliorates it. Trying to understand mental illness without accounting for the power of social connection, this line of thinking goes, is like studying planetary motion without accounting for gravity.\nLikewise, defining mental illness as a brain disorder shortchanges the role played by environment in general. Mental illness often occurs when a vulnerable psyche faces stress—sometimes chronic, sometimes sudden and acute. Many brain and large-scale genomic studies ignore this because the researchers don’t think environment is important, or because it’s hard to parse environmental effects into measurable components. Either way, a key element of mental health and illness can go overlooked.\nInsel and his defenders say he did his best to respond to these problems. They note that he pushed NIMH research to yield more help faster for the sickest patients, and that he funded plenty of research on environment, behavior-based therapy, and social connection.\nE. Fuller Torrey is a psychiatrist who worked at the NIMH in the 1970s and then became one of its fiercest critics as its emphasis increasingly focused on basic neurobiology in the 1990s. He was not thrilled about Insel’s appointment. “He’d worked on voles,” Torrey says. “My expectations were low.”\nTorrey, among those who called loudest for the NIMH to generate not just findings but treatments, had developed a metric to tally what percentage of NIMH studies stood a reasonable chance of helping patients. When Insel took over, Torrey told me, that estimate stood at about 5 percent. Insel brought it up into the 20s.\n“He did a yeoman’s job. I have nothing bad to say about Tom except that he didn’t stay longer.”\nInsel never wavered from framing the institute’s mission as biological. When I asked him about this directly, he unambiguously defended the NIMH’s biocentric stance. But if you examine the later years of his tenure closely enough, you see signs of vacillation—of someone still believing something, but without as much conviction.\nThis comes across in his 2013 ted Talk. Insel—as at ease, confident, and disarming as ever—opens with his iconic graphs showing how psychiatry has gone nowhere for decades. Then, after telling the audience members that he can understand why they think he should be fired, he pivots to say, “I think we are about to be in a very different world as we think about these illnesses,” and describes the newest wonders the NIMH is discovering about the brain.\nI keep going back to that talk because, right there on the ted stage, Insel seems to be of two minds. When he embraces his dismay and then sets it aside, I feel I’m seeing a person who is in the process of flipping his allegiance between two contradictory ideas. By the time of his ted Talk, Insel had ceased believing not just in the categories used to describe mental illnesses but in the magic of drugs or genomics to diagnose and treat them. He was essentially saying of psychiatry: We’ve fallen short of our promises for decades, but we’re finally figuring out the brain, so we’ll deliver. Yet even as he described the brain’s wonders, Insel seemed to understand that he was still talking paint chemistry, and not attending enough to the raging fire.\n“Tom was very blunt” toward the end of his tenure, says Bruce Cuthbert, who worked alongside Insel at the NIMH and served for 10 months as the acting director after Insel left. “He was brave enough to say, ‘Actually, we don’t know much of anything at all that could help individual patients.’ ”\nInsel is impatient. When he’d been at the NIMH, he told me recently, he’d thought of the results horizon as being 10 to 30 years out. But he is 65, and tired of waiting. “I want to make something happen in three years.” He told me this as we sat in the enormous, airy lobby of the new Verily building in South San Francisco. Early this May, as I was putting the final touches on this story, I emailed Insel to confirm and update a few things—and found that he was leaving Verily the next day. As small and nimble as Verily was compared with the NIMH, he said, he was now joining a far smaller outfit called Mindstrong Health, a start-up co-founded by three people—himself, Paul Dagum, and Richard Klausner—that would pursue an agenda much like the one he’d outlined at Verily.\n“A similar path,” he told me.\nInsel had jumped the track again.\nTwo weeks later I visited him at home in Pleasanton, California.\n“I loved working at Verily,” he told me. It was only after he started there, he said, that he grasped the scale of ambition and possibility that today’s biotech landscape offered. He liked Verily’s CEO, Andy Conrad, whose brash, sometimes profane style has reportedly driven away some other top Verily employees. “It was hard to leave,” Insel said. But the features inevitable in a 500-person company (Verily) that was part of a 74,000-person company (Alphabet, Google’s holding company) made a smaller option look much better. “The speed bumps you have to go over to get something out the door,” Insel said, would now be fewer and lower.\nAs we talked, Mindstrong was remodeling offices in Palo Alto, an hour’s drive away. Insel said he plans to work most days from home, where he can have lunch with his wife, and where a garden, a pool, a chicken coop, and a 350-vine vineyard beckon out back. But Insel didn’t join Mindstrong for the barefoot commute. He likes his co-founders and the greater agility offered by what he calls “a ‘two pizza’ company—small enough to feed with two pizzas.” Currently Mindstrong has about a dozen employees. Talking to me on his second day as Mindstrong’s president, Insel told me he had already found it far easier to strike research partnerships with caregiver or insurer networks to test and refine the patient-monitoring systems that are at the core of the company’s plan. “We actually did one of those last week,” he said, “and the network will start collecting the data this week. We can just move much faster at this size.”\nMindstrong’s plan, much like that of Insel’s unit at Verily, is to use the smartphone’s powers to do two things that psychiatry hasn’t figured out how to do: easily detect early, or even predict, the onset of mental illness; and quickly get effective, affordable care to those who need it.\nSmartphones can track daily behaviors that reflect mental health. A phone can sense the beginning of a crisis and trigger an appropriate treatment response.\nThis idea has been floating around Silicon Valley and mental-health circles for several years. Insel estimates that a good five or 10 other companies or research teams—including Verily—are trying to do something similar. Mindstrong hopes to gain an edge by combining Insel’s expertise and connections in the mental-health field with Klausner’s business experience and Dagum’s data-analysis tools and skills—and by moving quickly.\nThe force they hope to harness is the power of daily behavior, trackable through smartphone use, to reflect one’s mental health. As people start to slide into depression, for instance, they may do several of the following things easily sensed by a phone’s microphones, accelerometers, GPS units, and keyboards: They may talk with fewer people; and when they talk, they may speak more slowly, say less, and use clumsier sentences and a smaller vocabulary. They may return fewer calls, texts, emails, Twitter direct messages, and Facebook messages. They may pick up the phone more slowly, if they pick up at all, and they may spend more time at home and go fewer places. They may sleep differently. Someone slipping toward a psychotic state might show similar signs, as well as particular changes in syntax, speech rhythm, and movement.\nInsel says such data provide “a more objective, textured picture of people’s lives,” one collected continuously, rather than just at weekly sessions. (A therapist, the joke goes, knows in great detail how a patient is doing every Thursday at 3 o’clock.) With inputs like these, a phone could sense the beginning of a crisis and trigger an appropriate response. Because this response would come earlier, it could be more measured, less jarring, and less medication-heavy. “The earlier you intervene, the better the outcomes,” Insel says. “Instead of detect and treat, it’s predict and pre-empt.”\nMindstrong has three patents for a data-collection-and-analysis system built roughly for such purposes. Dagum designed this system, which can harvest some of the smartphone’s scores of data streams.\nHow might MindStrong’s system actually work in practice? Insel points to two prototype examples.\nThe first is a company called 7 Cups, which Insel first learned about because his daughter works there. 7 Cups provides text-based peer counseling and support for people with depression or anxiety or a long list of other conditions. Registering for the simpler services, such as peer connection, takes only seconds, and users can also get referrals to either coaches or licensed mental-health counselors and psychologists.\nAccording to the CEO, Glen Moriarty, 7 Cups serves a young, diverse demographic (90 percent are under the age of 35) that is likely to go underserved by traditional mental-health care. When Insel first heard about these demographics, he said, “a light bulb went off. This is about providing access for the first time”—and to people who don’t necessarily want to talk to a psychotherapist. They want to help each other. With a simple smartphone app and website, 7 Cups seeks to quickly and inexpensively connect such people while also providing a range of clinical support.\nThe company collects an astounding amount of anonymized data—a key to increasing its accuracy in detecting mental states, and to the efficacy of its response to signs of worsening illness. When 7 Cups told Insel that it gives everyone who registers the chance to take a standardized screening test for depression, anxiety, and stress, called dass‑21, he asked how long it would take to get him, say, 1,000 of those, scrubbed of identifying information.\n“They said, ‘We’ll do 2,000 this afternoon. You want all of them, or what part?’ ”\nA second rough model for Mindstrong’s approach is an app called prime, developed by Danielle Schlosser, a clinical psychologist whom Insel recruited to Verily from the psychiatry department at UC San Francisco. prime (Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivation Enhancement) was inspired partly by research showing that social connection and peer support can reduce the severity of depression and schizophrenia. Schlosser designed it for people ages 14 to 30 who’d been recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. It could be adapted for use by people diagnosed with or at risk for other mental disorders.\nThe heart of prime is a Facebook-like mobile app that connects members to both a circle of peers (in this case, others who have had psychotic episodes) and professional clinicians who can assist as needed. Currently about 50 people use prime at any given time, with at least five clinicians logged on and available. Most members use it daily. Members tell Schlosser they gain enormously simply by seeing that other members are perfectly normal people who happen to have schizophrenia.\nThe app has three real functions. One is connecting people so they can turn to one another for help, perspective, and affirmation. Another is providing a set of motivational essays, talks, and interactive modules that help with decisions and dilemmas common among the membership. The third is quickly spotting emerging crises and responding with peer, social-service, and clinician support.\nSometimes it works in more dramatic fashion. Schlosser describes one participant who, because he regularly conversed with people in the group, felt free to volunteer something he might not have if he were more isolated: He confessed that he was feeling a bit off, as if he might be sliding back toward psychosis. When Schlosser’s team reviewed his message history, it saw changes in syntax and language use that suggested emerging psychosis. His physician then tweaked his meds, and both his unease and his disordered syntax resolved.\nA system like prime or the one used by 7 Cups, notes Insel, combines the two components necessary to any approach to mental-health care—assessment, by collecting and analyzing the data a person and his smartphone can provide; and intervention, which might include anything from informal social support to medical support (either inpatient or outpatient).\nMindstrong, he says, will first focus on assessment, spending the next year or so testing phone-based data-collection-and-analysis systems; and then explore ways to partner with others to provide intervention through what Insel calls “learning-based mental-health care.” Continuous assessment and feedback would drive the interventions. Likewise, all therapies would use measurement-based practices, which give clinicians and patients steady feedback on what’s working and what isn’t—an approach shown to sharply improve outcomes.\nTo preserve users’ privacy, Insel says, Mindstrong will collect information only on an opt-in basis, and all data will be strongly encrypted. For most services, Mindstrong will save not actual data streams, such as what is said in spoken or typed conversations, but only metadata that reflect state of mind without revealing actual conversation. This might include semantic structures or the repeated use of key words or phrases that can reveal emotional or cognitive states such as depression, mania, psychosis, and cognitive confusion. All data will be firewalled according to strict patient-privacy practices.\nEven such metadata, of course, might make an attractive target for people who’d want to exploit it. (Picture a digital-era version of the Nixon administration’s bungled attempt to steal the psychiatric records of Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers, so that it could blackmail or smear him.) The only thing stopping such an effort in digital form might be the strength of Mindstrong’s firewall or its willingness to defy a government request for data. This danger is real. Google, for instance, has steadily reduced the proportion of government data requests it responds to, but in the second half of 2016, the company reports, it still produced data for 60 percent of such requests overall, and 79 percent of such requests from the U.S. The company reveals little to the public about which requests it honors or why. For these reasons, some digital-privacy experts think it’s dangerous for any company to collect and keep something as sensitive as psychiatric-patient data. For his part, Allen Frances feels it’s naive to trust any commercial entity to permanently protect such data from other commercial interests, hackers, or a government bent on getting the information. Others argue that this worry is itself naive, since most of us already leave enough footprints with smartphones, computers, phone calls, and credit-card purchases to forfeit the privacy Frances wants to protect. The question may not be whether a Mindstrong firewall would be perfect, but whether it would be stronger than the many porous containers already holding our personal and medical information.\nI once asked Insel how he saw his move to Silicon Valley in relation to the rest of his career. I expected he’d say it was a complete departure.\nInstead he said it felt to him like a return to his first concerns—“a return to behavior.” He meant the voles.\nThe fundamental assumption behind the vole work, and behind Insel’s career at the NIMH, was that beneath behavior lay biological mechanisms you could discern and then tweak to change that behavior. The crux of the biological model, in other words, was that you could and should address mental illness from within. Otherwise, why bother with the nearly impossible job of figuring out how it all worked? You looked for mechanisms so you could fix the machine.\nNow, however, Insel means to address mental disorders not from the inside, but from the outside; and not with something new, but with things at hand. He’s shifting from mechanistic discovery to practical application. He is acting on the epiphany he had when the man at his talk complained that Insel was discussing paint chemistry when he should have been putting out fires. It was then, Insel says, that he began “to realize that the really urgent issue isn’t that our treatments get better, but that we don’t use what we have today.”\nInsel will always believe in the value of research, of figuring out how things work. But our most pressing problem, he says—what keeps psychiatry from making the huge strides that have been made in disciplines like infectious disease and cardiology—“is not what we don’t know. We know well enough what works. Our problem is that we’re not doing it.”\nThe other big development in Insel’s work today is his embrace of social contact as a basic health necessity. For this he credits Schlosser’s work. “She convinced me that people with psychotic illness really crave social connections,” he said. “This was a great wake-up call for me: to see they want to connect on their own terms, sometimes anonymously, on their own schedule, in a way that they feel they can control”—often with others like them, in relationships that feel equal, rather than only with clinicians who may seem to hold too much power.\nWhy didn’t he come to all this sooner? Why now?, I asked.\n“I have always believed,” he said, “that to get the most impact, you should go where you get the most traction.” Even five years ago, he said, he could not have gotten traction on the ground that he and Mindstrong are working today. Smartphones weren’t ubiquitous enough; the data weren’t rich enough.\n“But now,” he said to me, “now we can do this.” He was leaning forward and smiling and holding both hands up in front of him as if he were fixing to catch something—as if he were a basketball player who’d just shook his defender and was calling for the ball to take an open shot. His eyes had the look of someone who felt he couldn’t miss."},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-06-13/private-prison-company-troubled-past-looks-re-open-immigration-detention-facility","title":"A private prison company with a troubled past looks to reopen an immigration detention facility in Texas","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Public Radio International","description":"The Department of Homeland Security has called for more immigration detention facilities to open along the US-Mexico border.

By the time the facility closed after a riot in 2015, it housed 2,700 immigrant prisoners.\nThe private prison company, Management and Training Corporation, uses the slogan “B.I.O.N.I.C.” on its website and job listings. It stands for: “Believe it or not, I care.”\nBut inmates housed at one of MTC’s facilities in Raymondville, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley didn’t buy the private prison company’s slogan. In 2015, a protest at the Willacy County Correctional Center turned into a riot. The fighting left the facility uninhabitable and it was shut down.\nMTC isn’t alone among private prison companies in its safety problems.\nA review by the Department of Justice inspector general released last August showed that private prisons, which hold 12 percent of about 200,000 federal inmates, have more \"safety and security incidents per capita\" than those operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\nAt the time, Willacy housed almost 2,700 immigrant prisoners, but it was not an immigration detention center. Rather, it housed male inmates who were going to be deported at the end of their criminal sentences. MTC responded to the inspector general review that their unique prison population — “criminal aliens,” mostly from Mexico — was not accounted for in the report.\nBut privately run immigration detention facilities, with oversight from the Department of Homeland Security, have also been plagued by complaints about conditions and safety. About 72 percent of more than 325,000 immigrant detainees were held in facilities run by many of the same private prison companies that run federal prisons, according to 2015 data obtained by TRAC, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.\nThe justice department announced last summer that it would end its use of privately-run prisons by allowing contracts to end over five years. The DHS conducted a review of their agreements with these companies, but said they would not do the same.\nTrump’s Department of Justice has announced it will resume contracting with private prison companies. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a one-paragraph memo reversing the Obama-era decision that ending those contracts “impaired the Bureau’s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system.”\nIn the first months of the Trump administration, the number of immigrants arrested and detained by the immigration agency has increased. One of Donald Trump’s executive orders signed on January 25 called on the DHS to \"allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.\"\nSo, almost two years after the Willacy County Correctional Center was closed, MTC is looking to reopen it again — this time as an immigration detention facility near the border. They are currently in talks with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the immigration agency within DHS.\nPrisoners stand at the western fence as law enforcement officials from a wide variety of agencies converge on the Willacy County Correctional Center in Raymondville, Texas on February 20, 2015 in response to a prisoner uprising. Some say the prisoners were protesting the conditions and lack of medical care at the facility, but others says it was actually prison staff who caused the riot.\nCredit:\nDavid Pike/AP via Valley Morning Star\nCarl Takei is a staff attorney at the National Prison Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. He says he would not be surprised if MTC and ICE finalize a contract, despite their troubled history together.\n“In 2006, it opened-up as an immigration detention facility and it earned the nickname of ‘Ritmo’ — the Gitmo of Raymondville — because of reports of widespread sexual abuse, overcrowding, vermin infestations and unsanitary conditions,” says Takei. “Ritmo was a tent city prison, meaning it was made-up of row after row of 200-foot-long kevlar tents behind barbed wire fences.”\nBoth men and women who were either facing deportation, received final orders for removal from the US, or were actively fighting their cases to remain in the country, were housed at the Willacy Detention Facility from 2006 to 2011.\nAfter problems came to light, ICE decided not to extend its contract with MTC.\nAbout a month later, the facility reopened under contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons as a “criminal alien requirement prison,” a contract it maintained from 2011 to 2015. These types of prisons hold people who are serving sentences for federal crimes, but are not US citizens.\nTakei says these kinds of contracts created “a separate, segregated system of shadow private prisons” without the types of rehabilitation services and programs found at regular federal prisons.\n“The Bureau of Prisons felt that it could send people who are not US citizens to private prisons because it could assume they wouldn’t return to US communities,” he says. “It didn’t particularly matter if the private prisons failed to rehabilitate them.”\nMost of the people detained at the Willacy County prison during those years were convicted of drug offenses or for illegally entering the US after being deported at least once. Takei says people convicted of illegal reentry serve sentences of anywhere between two and 20 years.\nIn 2014, the American Civil Liberties Union published a report about the alleged offenses at the Willacy County facility, both as an immigration detention facility and as a prison.\n“We heard many of the same complaints that had plagued Willacy in its incarnation as an immigration detention center,” says Takei. “Overcrowding, toilets that constantly overflowed, insects crawling into the tents, solitary confinement cells being used as overflow space and inadequate medical treatment. People even said there was a feeling of anger and frustration throughout the prison.”\nThe next year was the riot. Some say the prisoners were protesting the conditions and lack of medical care at the facility, but others says it was actually prison staff who caused the riot. In August 2016, the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General issued a report that the Willacy County corrections center was uninhabitable.\nA question for President Trump: How will you handle cases of abuse at privately run prisons and immigration detention centers?\nA few months later, Willacy County officials filed a lawsuit against MTC and blamed the private prison company for the riot. The lawsuit cites MTC’s “abysmal management of the prison.”\n“MTC allowed the abysmal conditions to continue without taking any action or notifying the County of or attempting to rectify the problems with the Prison,” says the complaint. “Further, MTC failed to address the issue of prison overcrowding, presumably because MTC was paid an additional per diem for inmates beyond the 90 percent capacity threshold.”\nThe county suffered a major economic loss after the prison closed in 2015. Aurelio Guerra is a Willacy County judge and sits on the county’s five-person Commissioners Court (Texas calls its elected county leaders judges — though it's not a traditional judicial role). He says they relied heavily on the income the MTC facility brought in.\n“That particular facility generated about $2.4 million a year for the county,” says Guerra. “Unfortunately, a big percent of those monies were used for the general fund to run the county.”\nSome of the money collected by Willacy County came from the federal government. The county collected a fee for every inmate in the prison. And part of that money went to paying off the debt on the facility and its operating costs.\nSince the closure of the prison, Willacy County has cut its budget from $8.1 million to $6.9 million. Guerra says the county’s office had to cut about 24 jobs, plus all 400 jobs at the facility were lost.\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, Willacy County is home to about 21,000 people — about 35 percent live in poverty. The closure of the Willacy Correctional Center made it even more difficult to find work in the county. The county was about $68 million in debt after the facility’s closure in 2015.\nRaymondville City Manager Eleazar Garcia Jr. says the county made its deal with MTC using a County Public Facilities Corporation, a separate quasi-governmental agency that allows them to issue bonds for major projects, like building the facility.\nThere was a $60 million bond issued for the first prison, then the facility had an expansion, requiring more debt — a little more than $60 million, says Garcia.\nGarcia says when the county ended its contract with ICE and the facility became a federal prison in 2011, a retrofit was needed. So the corporation sold more bonds, increasing its debt to about $100 million.\nThat debt is one of the reasons why, Guerra says, the commissioners sued MTC, “to have somebody accountable for us not having that facility operating.”\nThe commissioners agreed to drop the lawsuit on March 7, 2017, at a commissioner’s court meeting, if MTC purchased the facility outright. The county paid off almost all of the outstanding bonds with the revenue.\nThe county says it is now in full support of an MTC contract with ICE, or another governmental partner, despite its lawsuit charging that the company mismanaged the prison.\nGuerra says it’s not up to the county to determine if MTC qualifies to operate facilities in the area. That, he says, is the role of the federal government.\nWillacy County learned some lessons from the first time it disentangled itself from the private prison industry.\nSince the closure of the facility, the county has had to find other ways to bring money to the area. Garcia says about six years ago officials brought several wind turbine projects to the area.\nThere are about 400 turbines in the eastern part of the county, 150 are currently being worked on and another 100 may come to the area.\nThese projects bring in construction jobs initially, but the county also benefits because the county can tax the windmills and gain some revenue.\nWillacy County has also created a three-year plan to navigate and reassess the way they allocate the budget moving forward. Guerra is also looking to the possibility of a liquified natural gas pipeline that will run-through the county.\nGuerra says officials now understand the importance of having a diversified economy, so the county is not reliant on prisons. But the hunt for other opportunities isn’t easy — and immigration detention is one option right in front of them.\n“Would I rather have a big manufacturer having 500 to 1,000 jobs here?” asks Guerra. “Yes, but that is not on the table and so this is basically what we have. And I’ll listen to the constituents that have me here as county judge. It seems to me that there is no opposition, at least here locally.”\nThere is no contract between ICE and MTC yet, so Guerra does not yet know what role the county might play. But he does know the facility will be on the county’s tax roll, so they’ll be able to tax the facility and gain some additional revenue.\nAnd if the Willacy facility reopens, there will be some changes. Instead of holding 3,000 inmates, it will be downscaled to about 1,000. Also, the tent-like kevlar structures will be dismantled.\nAlso: Here’s how private prisons are being challenged, even as they scale up\nIssa Arnita is the communications director for MTC, which is headquartered in Utah. He says they’re constantly looking for ways to make all of their facilities more safe and secure to prevent previous issues from recurring.\n“We’ve been operating prisons for federal governments and state governments for more than 30 years, and while there have been some incidents, our record is good and clean and solid,” says Arnita. “Those who work with us understand that, including the county.”\nThe county’s lawsuit, with its allegations of severe mismanagement, is water under the bridge.\n“I think sometimes you say things you don’t really mean in the heat of the moment, or when you’re under a lot of pressure, and I believe that’s what happened,” says Arnita.\nAs for the ACLU’s 2014 account of abuses and health care issues, Arnita says it was “agenda-driven.”\n“They’ll go in there with an agenda and talk to certain individuals in the facility,” he says. “We allow them to come in the facility, they talk and they get what they want to hear and then they develop a report based on that.”\n“In terms of performance, we’re monitored by our government partner every single day. They see what we do, they see how we treat the offenders, they see the medical care that we give them, they understand the programming we provide for them and the services. They know that we’re a quality company.”\nBut Takei at the ACLU says government oversight is inadequate because there is no third-party review of immigration detention centers or federal prisons. The Bureau of Prisons and ICE have an internal system of private prison oversight to identify problems and monitor their facilities.\n“ICE routinely conducts annual inspections that use a checklist form to decide whether the facility is sufficiently complying with ICE detention standard,” says Takei. “In addition to those annual inspections, sometimes, but not every year, a facility may be visited by the office of detention oversight, which was created by the Obama administration.”\nThe Office of Detention Oversight conducts a more in-depth investigation of conditions at facilities. They review medical records and examine the practices of a facility. In 2016, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General began its own program of detention facility inspections.\nTakei says even though these internal inspections exist, there are still problems with oversight. The Willacy facility, he says, should not be reopened and operated by MTC.\nArnita says MTC’s primary objective, after safety and security, is to provide effective programming to offenders and detainees, so that when they are released they are less likely to reoffend. It operates 22 correctional facilities, many of which are in Texas.\n“We’ve got everything in place to make sure that our facilities are safe, but it’s important to understand inmates, or detainees, at times will attempt to cause problems,” says Arnita. “That happens at public facilities, it happens at private facilities. It happens everywhere, but when you’re looking for incidents and you base an entire company’s reputation on an incident, that’s disingenuous.”\nIf ICE does contract with MTC to reopen the Willacy County facility, immigrant detainees will not be brought in right away. Arnita says it will take several months to make repairs to the damaged structure. After several months of negotiating with ICE to secure a contract, no official agreement has been made.\nFind more documents related to this story here.

When she walked down the halls, clusters of students would shout at her, referring to her as “mister.” In stairwells, students would yell that her voice sounded like a man.\nThe harassment didn’t surprise her, even if it stung, cutting to the core of her identity. Sadly, she sees it as one of the occupational hazards of being a transgender teacher, she said.\nIn February, the Trump administration rolled back protections for transgender students. It rescinded guidance that called on school districts to allow students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender.\nLGBTQ students were not the only people in schools that this action impacted. Transgender educators ― even if the move did not necessarily impact the bathroom they use ― had to watch as the rights of LGBTQ students were severed, while facing their own, unique workplace challenges.\nThe exact number of transgender people who work as educators are unknown, and overall, exact data on the issue is hard to come by. But the ones who do work in education often have to navigate a sticky web of parents, students and colleagues who have varying levels of acceptance, amid a backdrop of minimal workplace protections, The Huffington Post found after interviewing seven transgender educators in March.\nThese educators are a self-selecting group who have been open about their gender identity at work. Not all transgender people have the same luxury or choose the same path.\nRebecca Klein\nTrump’s bathroom rollback was unsurprising for Akyurtlu, who is in her second year of teaching math at a high school for teens who are behind in credits. The 31-year-old teacher said she is “well aware that any protections we do have are extremely recent and extremely tenuous.” That’s why she is trying to coach her students to be vigilant about fighting for social justice.\nEarlier this month, she restarted her school’s previously dormant Gay Straight Alliance club. Indeed, she has formed supportive relationships with some of the school’s LGBTQ students. They sometimes act as her protector if any students targeted her. Last year, she watched as some of them got in shouting matches with their intolerant peers.\nWhile Akyurtlu feels lucky to have an accepting school administration and colleagues, she wishes there is more she could do for her transgender students, she said in a recent interview in her teacher’s union office. Last year, she kept a watchful eye on the few transgender students who attended the institution.\nAkyurtlu would remind their teachers to refer to them using the proper pronouns and call them by the correct names. When she would spot these students in the hallways ― they tended to stick together ― she would try and cram in as much advice as possible.\n“Anytime I saw them I would bring them aside and be like OK, ‘Where are you getting your healthcare needs taken care of? What kinds of hormones are you taking? Here’s some organizations you can go to if you get into legal trouble ― just try to educate them about their health needs and rights,” said Akyurtlu, who started working as a teacher after spending time as a graduate student at Cornell University and then working in the nonprofit sector with LGBTQ groups. “Hell, I didn’t have any teachers growing up who would have supported gay kids. Hell, sometimes they were the nastiest ones.”\nIt breaks Akyurtlu’s heart, though, that the students didn’t end up sticking around. Several months before a few of them would have gotten their high school diplomas, they dropped out.\nShe doesn’t blame them for leaving school ― noting that they had “all of these needs and all of these traumatic things going on, and I’m supposed to teach you geometry?”\nThankfully, she has heard that at least one of them is alive and seems to be doing OK. She worries about the others. With a group that has high rates of criminalization and suicide, the statistics can be daunting.\n“We have to make a priority of them and not just settle for the kids with accepting parents or the school that unveils unisex bathrooms. I think we have to really be willing to not just admit these girls exist but that they are part of our community,” Akyurtlu said.\nCourtesy of Sam Long The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.\nSam Long, a transgender educator in Denver, had a vastly different experience from Akyurtlu in explaining his gender identity to students. While Akyurtlu did not have control over how and when her kids made this discovery― she supposes they found out on the internet ― Long prepared a carefully crafted speech for his students.\nLong didn’t initially plan on telling his students his story this year. Long works at a charter school that just opened and currently only serves ninth-graders. He wanted to wait and see how the school’s culture developed.\nThen the election happened. Suddenly it seemed urgent to open students’ eyes to the diversity that surrounds them, especially after he heard wise-cracking students make jokes about LGBTQ issues.\nLong asked his administration if he could tell his story to the students in a daily school-wide meeting. Based on scheduling, they said, he wouldn’t be able to do it until February. Soon, February became March.\nThe day before the event, he was nervous, repeatedly reminding himself to watch for students’ reactions instead of rushing through the speech. But he was ultimately surprised at how well it went. Weeks later, he said he could see what a positive effect his words had on his relationship with students.\nStanding in front of the entire grade in the school’s front hall, Long told attentive students and colleagues how he transitioned between his sophomore and junior year of high school, and faced intense discrimination from his school administrators.\nLong’s high school wouldn’t let him use the male restrooms, so he would either wait to secretly use a male restroom in an isolated part of the school, or go in the woods outside. When he tried to go on an overnight field trip with the school’s jazz band, he was told he wouldn’t be allowed to room with male or female students, and would have to pay his own way for a single room if he wanted to attend. He didn’t have the money.\nAfter facing so much intolerance from teachers and administrators, he sued the school years later so that future students might not have to face the same isolation ― a story which he thinks his students appreciated.\n“I talked about how much of a gift it is to have your identity and be comfortable with your identity,” Long said. “I think they noticed how important it was symbolically for me to share my story. To show that level of vulnerability is important to this community.”\nReferencing an old quote from the author John Shedd, he wanted to show his students that “ships are always safe in the harbor but that’s not what ships are made for.”\nWhereas Long thinks some of his students might have previously thought of him as a “boring straight man” or “as somebody to whom school and academics has always come easy to,” they soon learned the reality. “I had a horrible time at school and a hard time at home and I was homeless for a period of time,” he said. “That’s definitely not something they would have assumed.”\nLong and Akyurtlu are lucky in that they are both able to be open about their identities at their jobs. In many ways, they are exceptions. All around the country, transgender teachers have been fired and punished for their identity.\nBut Akyurtlu hopes this won’t hold other transgender people back from going into education.\n“I know it seems like possibly the hardest job in the world to do when you’re transgender and you will deal with some things, and it will be hard, but it’s hard for everybody, and we can do it,” Akyurtlu said. “I think it’s really necessary for students to be able to see a transgender person in this role, to normalize it in such a day to day constant way really makes a big impact.”\nRebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

My preschool classroom is running beautifully on autopilot. The 4-year-olds know what to do next before I tell them. They are even taking care of each other when tears rise up.\nIn days we will all go our separate ways. We may see each other in our south Minneapolis wanderings, or at an event or at the store, but we won’t be a cohesive, cozy, caring community enveloped in our room of play and learning every day.\nPeople write off the big, wide emotions of this time of year as “spring fever.” It’s a fever all right, from a sickness called grief. We are, in our 4-year-old or 50-some-year-old way, grieving the loss of this group. We will never, ever, be this group again. Our in-jokes will be lost on others who weren’t there, our insights as we discussed our favorite picture books will be silently integrated into our endlessly evolving and ever-growing minds, and that special day when everyone wanted an icicle and we could find one for everyone will be forgotten in the folds of our memory.\nA wise person once told me that life is about learning to attach and detach. I was so angry, I rejected the thought immediately. What a stupid piece of wisdom to share! Keep it to yourself.\nBut it’s true. We attach to parents, homes, jobs, puppies, children, students, neighbors, books, coats. Then come deaths, moves, layoffs, aging dogs, empty-nesting, ends of school years, more moves, the last pages of books, and outgrown or outworn coats. We detach because we have to — due to circumstance, choice, a move toward health and because, as my favorite kindergarten teacher said, “Children, that’s the circle of life.”\nThe warm, magnetic, blinding light of attachment feels so good, so right. We feel grounded and endlessly competent, ready to meet any challenge. Filled with energy and life-giving generosity. We smile and celebrate as we attach. Exulting in our human community. It’s the detach we usually botch. We ignore it, forget to cry, minimize it and infection sets in. It’s not spring fever; it’s grief, anxiety and bewilderment. Children think everything is forever. Adults want everything to be forever.\nSo lately, I’ve been thinking about adding to my friend’s wisdom. It is about attaching and detaching, and it’s also about what comes after the detachment. If it’s a death we are facing, how do we continue that relationship, mature into a layered understanding of what happened or didn’t happen in life with that person? If it’s the end of a class community, in what way will we bring that community to the next? Even the little ones know they can keep those learnings and add to them in the next year.\nIf it’s a job loss, we reflect on the reality and the difficulty of the job we have lost and translate that into a leap of hope into the next. The empty nest: We never knew when we first held that baby that the goal of our seemingly endless child-rearing work was to actually teach our children to leave. So when the job is done well, and they do leave, we have ample time to reflect on those warm years of face-to-face attachment. Then figure out what it means to face each other as adults.\nThe luscious possibility of the time after detaching. We are vulnerable at these liminal times, fevered and confused. There is so much to wring out of these early summer days as we leave so many things. Classrooms empty; the indoor places of the city become quiet as we head outdoors. Out to find the next challenge, the next community, the next task.\nI am a temp, as we all are. Temporary by design. Temporary in my importance to my students. Temporary in middle adult health, and temporary on this big blue exceedingly rare planet.

","date":"2017-05-03","full_text":"The Chromebook has gone from a standing start in 2011 to wild popularity in the market for education technology, which tech companies have traditionally viewed as a critical way to win over the next generation of users.\nIn 2016, mobile devices running Alphabet Inc.'s Google’s Chrome operating system accounted for 58 percent of the US market for primary and secondary schools, according to Futuresource Consulting.\nThe Microsoft products introduced Tuesday, including a new version of its Windows operating system, software to boost collaboration among students and a new Surface laptop, clearly show the influence of the Chromebook, industry watchers say.\n“The success of the Chromebook has awakened sleeping giants,” said Tyler Bosmeny, chief executive of Clever, an education technology company. “There’s so much investment into the space – it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.”\nFor years after the release of the Chromebook in 2011, Apple Inc. and Microsoft stuck to their strategies of offering slightly modified and discounted versions of their products for educators.\nBut the Chromebook's low price – it starts at $149 – and easy management proved irresistible to many schools. Google also saw a key chance to expand its market share several years ago with the approach of an online testing mandate in the United States.\nTo capitalize on the opportunity, the company created a “test mode,” which restricts access to the rest of the web while students complete assessments, said Rajen Sheth, a senior director of product management at Google.\nThe preparations paid off: Sales of the Chromebook jumped tenfold between 2012 and 2013, Mr. Sheth said.\nWhile Google manufactures some Chromebooks, the devices aimed at the education market are supplied by partners such as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Acer Inc. The operating system is free for educators and hardware manufacturers, and Google sells schools an education package including device management and support for a $30 fee.\nFor Microsoft, Tuesday's event was the culmination of a campaign to emulate key aspects of the Chromebook strategy, said Mike Fisher, associate director for the education division at Futuresource Consulting.\nMicrosoft's hardware partners are now selling hybrid tablet-laptop devices based on the Surface design starting at $189. Microsoft executives boasted that the operating system announced Tuesday boots up rapidly, a hallmark of the Chromebook.\nThe company also introduced a new code-builder addition to its Minecraft education edition to help students learn coding skills through the popular game.\nFor Microsoft, the test will be how easily it can explain its offering to educators, Mr. Fisher said.\n\"The Google education ecosystem is quite straightforward,\" he said. \"With Microsoft, there’s a lot of moving parts.\"\nMicrosoft declined to comment.\nApple, for its part, has lowered the price of the iPad to $299 for education customers and made it possible for students to share devices, in addition to simplifying management.\n“It’s about trying to reach every teacher and every student,” said Susan Prescott, a vice president of product management and marketing at Apple.\nFollow Stories Like This\nSign Up\nDespite Google’s US dominance, its position is weaker in classrooms overseas, where many markets have not yet seen an impetus to embrace technology en masse, said Fisher of Futuresource Consulting.\nIn 2016, devices running Android and Chrome made up 23 percent of the mobile market outside the United States, compared with 65 percent for Microsoft’s Windows, according to Futuresource."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jun/12/uber-bikes-manchester-mobike-china-global-ofo","title":"'Uber for bikes': Chinese firm eyes global dominion with launch in Manchester","author_text":"Benjamin Haas","keywords":["Cities","Cycling","China","Asia Pacific","Life And Style","World News","City Transport","Manchester","Cambridge","Bristol","Greater Manchester","Uk News","Environment"],"publication_text":"the Guardian","description":"Mobike to open ‘dockless’ bike share scheme in Manchester with initial 1,000 bikes as Chinese companies take aggressive battle for market share to the west","date":"2017-06-12","full_text":"In a move that has the potential to reshape the look and feel of many cities, one of China’s biggest “dockless bike share” companies, Mobike, will announce today that it will officially launch in Manchester and Salford.\nThe plan from Mobike – which operates 5 million bikes in China and is backed by Foxconn and internet giant Tencent – has the blessing of both city councils and Transport for Greater Manchester. It will kick off at the end of June with an initial 1,000 bikes and is likely to expand dramatically from there.\nUnlike in most western schemes, where shared bikes are rented from docks, in China many urban residents instead find available bikes via GPS and an app, and then unlock it with their phone. The “Uber for bikes” model has also seen virulent competition and bikes littered haphazardly around cities or dumped by the hundreds in bushes and alleyways.\nMobike’s announcement means it will competing overseas with one of its most successful domestic competitors, Ofo, who are also gearing up for global expansion.\n“I would like to be in at least three cities in the UK by the end of the year,” said Joseph Seal-Driver, Ofo’s UK operations director. “An obvious place to go is London. That’s where there are real problems with congestion and air quality, in particular.”\nOfo had in fact beaten Mobike to the British market, with roughly 50 bikes in Cambridge as part of a pilot programme, but has not yet determined when it will expand. In the Ofo system, riders pay 50p for 30 minutes, with no access fee. By contrast, London’s cycle hires cost £2 to access the system for a day, but the first half hour of each ride is free, and users pay £2 for every 30 minutes thereafter.\nMobike has not yet announced pricing details for its Manchester launch.\nThe new mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, called schemes like Mobike’s “an untested idea in the UK”, and said he would keep it under review.\n“As mayor, I want to see many more people swapping their cars for bikes,” he said. “We’re conscious that our city centre is a complex and busy area already, so TfGM has been working hard to establish a voluntary code of working with Mobike to make sure the service operates in a way that doesn’t inconvenience other road users, pedestrians or city centre traders.”\nAnother dockless bike sharing startup, YoBike, launched in Bristol last month with 500 cycles, and says demand more than doubled initial predictions. YoBike is clearly inspired by its Chinese competitors and its founder is from China, although the company has so far focused mainly on cities in Europe.\nOfo and Mobike will not charge cities to operate, as opposed to London’s “Boris bikes”, which cost taxpayers £145m from its inception through mid-2012. It was projected at the time to cost an additional £80m by the end of 2016, although pricing has since changed.\n“There are lots of campaigns by London boroughs that want the current scheme to expand, but they can’t do it because they don’t have the money,” Seal-Driver added. “A lot of cities are asking us to come work with them.”\nWhile “Boris bikes” were instrumental in increasing the profile of cycling in Britain, Seal-Driver said the system had serious limitations, such as limited geographic reach, slow expansion and bulky docking stations.\nDockless bikes, however, are far less orderly compared with sharing programmes that require the cycle to be returned to a purpose-built parking space.\nUsers download an app that displays a map with the locations of the GPS-enabled bikes, then use their phones to unlock the cycle. When a rider reaches their destination, they are free to park the bike wherever they want, with no need to return it to a fixed docking point.\nOfo and Mobike both set their sights closer to home when they began international expansion, inaugurating their first bicycle fleets outside China in Singapore.\n“No one really rode bicycles in Singapore, but the government wanted to encourage cycling to reduce congestion and promote healthier living,” said Yu Xin, co-founder of Ofo.\nThe company has about 6,000 bikes in Singapore, and there are about 20,000 trips per day on their bikes.\nBy the end of the year, Ofo plans to have operations in 20 countries outside China, mainly focusing on the US, Europe and south-east Asia, Yu said, although he declined to specify which countries. The company’s CEO, Dai Wei, has previously said that Ofo would target Japan, Spain, France, Germany and the Philippines, and Ofo already has bikes in the US, UK and Singapore.\nIn the US, many bikes have been placed on university campuses.\n“Young people are more likely to adopt new methods of transportation, new technologies,” Yu said. “But we’re not limited to universities. Wherever there’s need, we will go there.”\nDespite the often repeated mantra of trying to reduce congestion in cities, dockless bike share scheme have sometimes contributed to the problem.\nIn China, the companies saturated dozen of cities with bicycles in an all-out war for market share. While the goal was to ensure customers could always find a bicycle, the result was congested sidewalks and broken or unwanted cycles left in mangled piles.\nIn response, China’s government plans to issue national regulations this year, requiring companies to insure their users and holding them responsible for solving issues like reckless parking. Several cities in China already have local laws covering the bikes.\nEuropean cities could avoid similar problems by limiting the number of companies, Seal-Driver said, adding that a glut can form with just three to four operators vying for dominance in a single place. Mobike believes it has found a technological solution to maintaining order.\n“We track user’s behaviour, and we can reward them for good behaviour or punish them for improper behaviour,” said Florian Bohnert, Mobike’s head of international expansion.\nMobike uses a credit score for each user, which fluctuates based on where they park the bikes or forgetting to lock it after a ride. Each rider starts off with a score of 100, and earns points for taking rides or reporting improperly parked bikes. If a user’s score drops below 80, a 30-minute ride will cost about £56 in Singapore.\nBut expanding overseas has not always been smooth. When Bluegogo tried to expand into San Francisco in January, it was met by stiff resistance from local politicians, who received complaints from city residents. Less than four months later, the company suspended its US experiment. Bluegogo declined multiple interview requests.\nSan Francisco also enacted new regulations on dockless bike sharing, and as the companies enter new markets, local governments are likely to respond with new laws.\nAnother issue is that many cities, such as New York or Paris, already have agreements with dock-based bike sharing programmes. Ofo and Mobike say they are not excluding placing bicycles in those cities.\n“When we started in China, a lot of cities already had bike-sharing platforms with docks, but not many people were using them,” Yu said. “[Dockless bike sharing] is more convenient. You can ride to exactly where you want to go, and it’s much easier to sign up.”\nOfo is also open to including dock-based bike sharing programmes in its app, giving users more options and making paying more convenient, he added.\nBut not everyone in Singapore is eager to see the bikes, and many cities may not have the infrastructure, for decades centered on cars, to support a sudden influx of bicycles.\n“I’ve seen a few people ride Ofo or Mobike here, but not many,” said Cao Haoqing, a scientist at Procter \u0026 Gamble. “It’s unsafe here because there are no bicycle lanes.”\nThe 32-year-old prefers to take the subway or bus, adding: “Singapore already has a problem with disorderly parking, and [Ofo and Mobike] are making the situation worse.”\nAdditional reporting by Wang Zhen."},{"url":"http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2017/05/us_supreme_court_agrees_to_hea.html#incart_river_index","title":"U.S. Supreme Court will hear Ohio voter purging case","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"cleveland.com","description":"The U.S. Supreme Court will hear Ohio's case about purging voters who have moved or died.","date":"","full_text":"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted's appeal of a lower court decision that rejected the state's policy of starting to purge the registration of voters who fail to vote over a two-year period.\nAn appeals court ruled in September that the state's way of weeding out ineligible voters violates the National Voting Rights Act of 1993 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002.\nA ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the state's process for clearing ineligible voters from the voting roles because it punished inactive voters for not voting.\nHusted appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the lower court's opinion ignored basic federalism principles, calling it an \"unnecessary intrusion\" into Ohio's election process.\nHe also said the lower court decision left \"one of our most important election safeguards in limbo,\" arguing that \"proper voter roll maintenance, including the removal of deceased voters and those who have long since moved, is one of the pillars of ensuring fair elections.\"\nOhio Secretary of State Jon Husted is appealing a ruling that Ohio was improperly purging voters from its rolls. He argues that the process is important for election integrity.\nHusted expressed confidence Tuesday that the court will side with Ohio's interpretation of the National Voting Rights Act, which previous secretaries of state from both parties have followed. He said the state's practices ensure the integrity of Ohio's voter rolls.\n\"The decision by the Court to hear this case is encouraging,\" said a statement from Husted. \"I remain confident that once the Justices review this case they will rule to uphold the decades-old process that both Republicans and Democrats have used in Ohio to maintain our voter rolls as consistent with federal law.\"\nHusted said the policy removed nearly 560,000 deceased Ohioans from voting rolls since he became Secretary of State, and resolved the cases of more than 1.65 million voters who had multiple registrations. Proper maintenance of the state's voter means fewer Ohioans have trouble casting a ballot and more ballots are counted, Husted said.\nUpon learning that the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine released a statement that said he's \"pleased the Supreme Court agreed with my arguments that this decision needed review to clarify the important issue of how states like Ohio can best maintain up-to-date and accurate voter rolls.\"\nDeWine spokesman Dan Tierney said both parties will submit legal briefs to the court over the summer, and will likely make oral arguments before the court in September or October.

DeVos, an ardent supporter of school choice, is from western Michigan.\nThe meeting was the beginning of the process of approving funding for the Department of Education.\nRead more:\nAfter opening remarks in which she acknowledged that $9 billion \"may sound alarming,\" DeVos defended the cuts — which include nearly $5 billion in eliminated programs — saying the budget \"refocuses the department on supporting states and school districts in their efforts to provide high-quality education to all of our students.\"\nThe budget calls for investing $1 billion in school districts that promote school choice. It would increase funding for charter school grants. And it would invest $250 million in additional money into programs that provide scholarships for low-income students to attend private schools. Such programs come in many forms, including vouchers.\nRep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., questioned DeVos over her assertions throughout the hearing that much should be left to states to determine.\nClark cited a private, Christian school in Indiana that makes it clear in its student handbook that students whose homelife includes \"homosexual or bisexual activity\" or \"alternate gender identity\" may be denied admission. Clark said that school received $665,000 through a state voucher program.\nHer question: \"If Indiana applied for this federal funding, will you stand up that this school be open to all students?\"\nThere was some back and forth between the two, with DeVos saying that states set up the rules and noting that her department's Office of Civil Rights and existing gender protections \"are broadly applicable across the board.\"\nBut she kept going back to parents and their right to choose their children's education.\n\"So, if I understand your testimony ... there’s no situation of discrimination or of exclusion that, if a state approved it for its voucher program, that you would step in and say: 'That is not how we’re going to use our federal dollars?' \" Clark asked.\nDeVos replied, \"I go back to the bottom line is, we believe the parents are the best equipped to make choices for their children's schooling and education decisions.\"\n\"And too many children today are trapped in schools that do not work for them. We have to do something different,\" she said. \"We have to do something different than continuing a top-down, one-size-fits-all approach, and that is the focus. States and local communities are best equipped to make these decisions and framework.\"\nClark replied, \"I am shocked that you cannot come up with one example of discrimination that you would stand up for students.\"\nHer outrage was shared by other Democrats on the subcommittee. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., said that \"to take the federal government responsibility out of that is just appalling and sad.\"\nLee said she's concerned DeVos' department is proposing reducing $1.7 million from its Office of Civil Rights, which investigates discrimination complaints.\n\"To me, it's outrageous,\" she said. \"For you to sit here and say that it's OK if parents and local communities discriminate. It's very sad, shocking and disappointing.\"\nBut DeVos countered that she is not suggesting that students should not be protected and shouldn't be in a safe, secure and nurturing environment. \"They all should have that opportunity,\" she said.\n\"The department is going to continue to investigate any complaints or any issues surrounding allegations of discrimination,\" DeVos said. \"We have no proposal to change any of that. So, as we talk about states assuming more authority and flexibility in how they implement their programs for students, nothing about that changes our desire to ensure that students have a safe and secure environment.\"\nContact Lori Higgins: 313-222-6651, lhiggins@freepress.com or @LoriAHiggins"},{"url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40088006","title":"Earth-i plans space video network - BBC News","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"BBC News","description":"Earth-i promises daily, fast-turn-around pictures and colour video of the planet's surface.","date":"","full_text":"A British company has announced its intention to launch a big constellation of Earth observation satellites.\nA prototype spacecraft will go up later this year for testing, with the expectation that a further five platforms will follow in 2019.\nEarth-i, based in Guildford, says its train of satellites will deliver rapid, high-resolution imagery of the planet in still and video formats.\nAt best resolution, these products will see features just under a metre across.\nThe video is promised in full colour. It could be used to track moving objects such as cars and other vehicles; or, if the scene is held fixed on a specific point, it would enable 3D models of the ground to be constructed.\nEarth-i is already well established in the analytics business, processing and selling space pictures to a strong customer base. But this move, announced on the opening day of the biennial UK space conference in Manchester, would see the company operate its own satellites as well.\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Enable it in your browser or download Flash Player here.Sorry, you need Flash to play this.\nEarth-i has produced this simulation of what the video would look like\nExit player\nThese platforms are the fruit of an R\u0026D project coming out of Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL), also in Guildford.\nThe manufacturer has developed a new class of Earth observation spacecraft codenamed Carbonite.\nThe first in this series was built in just six months and was launched in 2015. The lessons learned from that experience were then applied to a second satellite which is now set to be the pathfinder in the Earth-i constellation.\n\"We worked on Carbonite-1 with SSTL and studied the performance to help develop the technology for Carbonite-2 which we will be calling EiX2,\" explained Richard Blain, the CEO of Earth-i.\n\"As for the constellation, we will launch that in batches of five. And in terms of the architecture, our baseline plan is for the first batch to go into one orbital plane, and then for the following batches to go into different planes, so that not only do we get high-frequency revisit to places on Earth but we also get to see places at different times of the day.\"\nThe total number of satellites in the constellation will depend on how the business for the pictures grows.\nEarth-i is chasing a burgeoning market that is attracting new types of customers who are only now beginning to understand the potential of daily, fast-turn-around imagery.\nSo, for example, whereas governments have long made use of Earth observation (EO) data for mapping towns and cities, to plan major infrastructure ventures and to track land-use changes - the likes of the financial sector is really just beginning to appreciate the intelligence value of space pictures.\nThose who trade in commodities are now gaining insights on supply chains, and on the activities at particular factories, ports, mines and oil fields; activities that all have financial implications.\nAnd just as satellite-navigation data - knowing where things are positioned in the world - has become a mainstay of the smartphone applications revolution, there is a feeling that the exploitation of EO data in this domain has barely scratched the surface.\nThis was part of the motivation for the UK government last year committing more money than any other member state to the Earth observation programme of the European Space Agency (Esa). There are big economic opportunities coming.\n\"There is an almost insatiable demand for data from space as people are realising its true value to both their planning and daily operations,\" said Josef Aschbacher, director of Earth observation at the European Space Agency.\n\"Higher resolution image data from commercial organisations is likely to be very valuable either in its own right or when used in conjunction with other data sources including medium-resolution image data such as that provided under the European Copernicus Programme.\"\nEarth-i's constellation would be the first European system to provide HD video of activity on the ground.\nTwo North American companies have already started doing this - Urthecast of Canada, and US firm Terra Bella (recently acquired by Planet Labs).\nEarth-i currently exploits the imagery coming from SSTL's DMC3 satellites. The capacity on this trio of spacecraft, which take 1m resolution pictures, is wholly leased by a Chinese concern called 21AT. Earth-i is the Beijing company’s international distributor.\nRichard Blain would not discuss the detail of the financing of the new constellation but said that a number of contracts were in place with SSTL.\n\"We are a well funded private company with a clear financial roadmap, supported by world class professional advisers and with a number of financial instruments at our disposal in order to ensure the continued successful deployment of our constellation following on from the next prototype satellite due for launch later this year,\" he told BBC News."},{"url":"http://nationswell.com/10-infrastructure-projects-to-build","title":"10 Infrastructure Projects We’d Like to See Get Off the Ground","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"NationSwell","description":"Meet the people renewing America at NationSwell. http://www.nationswell.com","date":"2017-01-24","full_text":"In his victory speech, Donald J. Trump vowed to “rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals.” The investment is long overdue: The American Society of Civil Engineers, in its most recent national assessment, rated the country’s infrastructure as a D-plus, just above failing. The group estimates that, by 2025, the nation will need a $1.44 trillion boost over current funding levels to meet growing needs.\nSince 2009, when Barack Obama doled out roughly $800 billion in a stimulus package, that money’s been hard to come by, largely blocked by partisanship. But advocates hope the election of Trump, who made his fortune in real estate, could launch a building boom. The Republican president, so used to seeing his name on gilded skyscrapers, hotels, casinos and golf courses, could cut a deal with congressional Democrats, who view public-works projects as an engine for job growth.\nAssuming Trump can indeed pass a bill, we at NationSwell have a few ideas for him to consider. A big, beautiful wall’s not one of them; instead, here’s the top 10 shovel-worthy alternatives we’d like the new administration to undertake.\nIn her confirmation hearing, Trump’s pick for Transportation Secretary, Elaine Chao, said the nation’s infrastructure is jeopardized “by a failure to keep pace with emerging technologies.” We like one that could dramatically cut congestion and traffic fatalities, even before self-driving cars hit the pavement. Smart traffic signals could communicate with cars. On one hand, they can transmit warnings about red lights or emergency vehicles to motorists, and on the receiving end, they could adapt the green-to-red cycles based on real-time conditions. The systems come relatively cheap, ranging from $500 to $3,000, and they’d save drivers tons of time and produce less smog from idling engines.\nThe FAA still monitors most air traffic through ground-based radar, a throwback to the World War II era. As part of its NextGen conversion, the regulator is trying to switch to an all-satellite system. With it, an air controller could track more planes in the sky, allow them to fly closer together and plan more direct routes, cutting down on infuriating delays on the tarmac. The next administration may try to privatize the FAA’s responsibilities, but regardless of who’s in charge, this modernization is sorely needed.\nAmtrak needs a safety update to prevent collisions and derailments (by installing the fail-safe technology known as positive train control), but the system could also use a new high-speed rail in the Southeast. Up north, the speedy Acela Express currently connects Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. There’s no reason to stop halfway. An extension could link the nation’s capital to Richmond, Va., Raleigh, N.C., Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. Not only would the track alleviate congestion on the I-95 freeway and at regional airports, it could prompt growth in the smaller cities of the New South, generating up to $12.8 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.\nDwight D. Eisenhower presided over one of the biggest modern infrastructure projects: the development of a 41,000-mile interstate highway system. The hubs of 1956, however, are different from the growing population centers today. Particularly out west, there’s a need for a new freeway, designated as I-11, between Phoenix and Las Vegas, the only two neighboring cities with more than 1 million residents who aren’t linked by an interstate. Serving 9.7 million people, the $11.4 billion thoroughfare will be extended from to the Mexican border at Nogales, Ariz., all the way up past Reno, Nev., to join with I-80, between Sacramento, Calif., and Salt Lake City."},{"url":"http://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/30/ariana-grande-manchester-concert","title":"Coldplay, Bieber to join Ariana Grande at Manchester concert","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Ariana Grande announced Tuesday that the \"One Love Manchester\" show will be held at the city's Old Trafford cricket ground just under two weeks after a bomber killed 22 people at the pop singer's concert in Manchester.","date":"","full_text":"Justin Bieber, Coldplay and Katy Perry will join Ariana Grande at a charity concert in Manchester, England, on Sunday.\nGrande announced Tuesday that the \"One Love Manchester\" show will be held at the city's Old Trafford cricket ground just under two weeks after a bomber killed 22 people at the pop singer's concert in Manchester.\nOther performers will include Pharrell Williams, Miley Cyrus, Usher, Niall Horan and Take That.

Hands around the room flew up. “If you weren’t in this city, this city wouldn’t be what it is.”\nThe same is true of the five people, and the institutions they represent, who were on stage with Gutmann Thursday night: Temple University President Richard Englert; Community College of Philadelphia’s Donald Generals; Drexel University’s John Fry; Jefferson Health System President and CEO Steve Klasko; and moderator Jeremy Nowak, The Citizen’s chairman.\nIt was the first-ever conversation among the leaders of Philadelphia’s universities, which—in many ways—are key to the city’s future success. They are, as the panelists pointed out, the institutions that employ the most Philadelphians; educate the most potential employees; provide the most healthcare; and influence everything from research to real estate to economic development in Philadelphia.\nNowak, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution, urged the presidents to give frank assessments of the economic and political realities of running universities, of their need to be responsive to their communities, and of how city leaders, in turn, could be better partners in growing Philadelphia. Each responded with examples of how they, and their school communities, work to better their city.\nAt Penn, Gutmann said that the school’s “liquidity” has allowed them to develop research facilities on formerly moribund property in West Philadelphia, as with the Pennovation Center. And she talked about how her campus serves as a training ground for diplomacy, citing a student group calling itself MAJIC—Muslims And Jews In Cahoot. Having met one another on campus, members now work together to bridge wide divides.\nKlasko noted the passion of his medical students to make change in the world around them. “They don’t wait to ask permission,” he said, pointing out that Jefferson’s students are the ones making sure that hospital wellness services, like blood pressure readings, are accessible to community members not affiliated with the school. “Our students don’t wait for the federal government. They solve problems themselves.”\nTemple’s Englert pointed out the school’s decades-long efforts to employ local residents in North Philly, while Fry, at Drexel, talked about his university’s outreach into the Promise Zone of Mantua, just five blocks from the center of his campus.\nFinally, CCP’s Generals said, he is looking to open more campuses, in more parts of the city—like Kensington and South Philly—to make higher education more accessible to more Philadelphians. “We have a 26 percent poverty rate in this city,” Generals said. “And we [at CCP] touch many of those people. ”\nThe panelists joked about competition among each other, and their institutions—with Klasko noting at one point that perhaps there’s a reason they’ve never been all together before. But they were in agreement on at least one thing: Education, and research, are the keys to upward mobility, whether for first-in-their-family college students—like Gutmann—or for those Philadelphians from surrounding neighborhoods, for whom college is a way to change entire generations of a family.\nFlanked by Fry and Klasko, Gutmann near the end of the discussion looked around at her fellow university leaders on stage, and urged them to join her in finding ways to collaborate more together.

Less than 20 years from now, however, the number of babies","date":"2017-04-05","full_text":"More babies were born to Christian mothers than to members of any other religion in recent years, reflecting Christianity’s continued status as the world’s largest religious group. But this is unlikely to be the case for much longer: Less than 20 years from now, the number of babies born to Muslims is expected to modestly exceed births to Christians, according to new Pew Research Center demographic estimates.\nMuslims are projected to be the world’s fastest-growing major religious group in the decades ahead, as Pew Research Center has explained, and signs of this rapid growth already are visible. In the period between 2010 and 2015, births to Muslims made up an estimated 31% of all babies born around the world – far exceeding the Muslim share of people of all ages in 2015 (24%).\nThe world’s Christian population also has continued to grow, but more modestly. In recent years, 33% of the world’s babies were born to Christians, which is slightly greater than the Christian share of the world’s population in 2015 (31%).\nWhile the relatively young Christian population of a region like sub-Saharan Africa is projected to grow in the decades ahead, the same cannot be said for Christian populations everywhere. Indeed, in recent years, Christians have had a disproportionately large share of the world’s deaths (37%) – in large part because of the relatively advanced age of Christian populations in some places. This is especially true in Europe, where the number of deaths already is estimated to exceed the number of births among Christians. In Germany alone, for example, there were an estimated 1.4 million more Christian deaths than births between 2010 and 2015, a pattern that is expected to continue across much of Europe in the decades ahead.\nThe phrase “babies born to Christians” and “Christian births” are used interchangeably in this report to refer to live births to Christian mothers. Parallel language is used for other religious groups (e.g., babies born to Muslims, Muslim births).\nThis report generally avoids the terms “Christian babies” or “Muslim babies” because that wording could suggest children take on a religion at birth.\nThe assumption in these estimates and projections is that children tend to inherit their mother’s religious identity (or lack thereof) until young adulthood, when some choose to switch their religious identity. The projection models in this report take into account estimated rates of religious switching (or conversion) into and out of major religious groups in the 70 countries for which such data are available.\nGlobally, the relatively young population and high fertility rates of Muslims lead to a projection that between 2030 and 2035, there will be slightly more babies born to Muslims (225 million) than to Christians (224 million), even though the total Christian population will still be larger. By the 2055 to 2060 period, the birth gap between the two groups is expected to approach 6 million (232 million births among Muslims vs. 226 million births among Christians).1\nIn contrast with this baby boom among Muslims, people who do not identify with any religion are experiencing a much different trend. While religiously unaffiliated people currently make up 16% of the global population, only an estimated 10% of the world’s newborns between 2010 and 2015 were born to religiously unaffiliated mothers. This dearth of newborns among the unaffiliated helps explain why religious “nones” (including people who identity as atheist or agnostic, as well as those who have no particular religion) are projected to decline as a share of the world’s population in the coming decades.\nBy 2055 to 2060, just 9% of all babies will be born to religiously unaffiliated women, while more than seven-in-ten will be born to either Muslims (36%) or Christians (35%).\nThese are among the key findings of a new Pew Research Center analysis of demographic data. This analysis is based on – and builds on – the same database of more than 2,500 censuses, surveys and population registers used for the 2015 report “The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050.” Both reports share the same demographic projection models, but the figures on births and deaths in this analysis have not been previously released.\nIn addition, this report provides updated global population estimates, as of 2015, for Christians, Muslims, religious “nones” and adherents of other religious groups. And the population growth projections in this report extend to 2060, a decade further than in the original report.\nThe projections do not assume that all babies will remain in the religion of their mother. The projections attempt to take religious switching (in all directions) into account, but conversion patterns are complex and varied. In some countries, including the United States, it is fairly common for adults to leave their childhood religion and switch to another faith (or no faith). For example, many people raised in the U.S. as Christians become unaffiliated in adulthood, and vice versa – many people raised without any religion join a religious group later in their lives. But in some other countries, changes in religious identity are rare or even illegal.2\nAt present, the best available data indicate that the worldwide impact of religious switching alone, absent any other factors, would be a relatively small increase in the number of Muslims, a substantial increase in the number of unaffiliated people, and a substantial decrease in the number of Christians in coming decades. Globally, however, the effects of religious switching are overshadowed by the impact of differences in fertility and mortality. As a result, the unaffiliated are projected to decline as a share of the world’s total population despite the boost they are expected to receive from people leaving Christianity and other religious groups in Europe, North America and some other parts of the world. And the number of Christians is projected to rise, though not as fast as the number of Muslims.\nGlobal population projections, 2015 to 2060\nChristians were the largest religious group in the world in 2015, making up nearly a third (31%) of Earth’s 7.3 billion people. Muslims were second, with 1.8 billion people, or 24% of the global population, followed by religious “nones” (16%), Hindus (15%) and Buddhists (7%). Adherents of folk religions, Jews and members of other religions make up smaller shares of the world’s people.\nBetween 2015 and 2060, the world’s population is expected to increase by 32%, to 9.6 billion. Over that same period, the number of Muslims – the major religious group with the youngest population and the highest fertility – is projected to increase by 70%. The number of Christians is projected to rise by 34%, slightly faster than the global population overall yet far more slowly than Muslims.\nAs a result, according to Pew Research Center projections, by 2060, the count of Muslims (3.0 billion, or 31% of the population) will near the Christian count (3.1 billion, or 32%).3\nExcept for Muslims and Christians, all major world religions are projected to make up a smaller percentage of the global population in 2060 than they did in 2015.4 While Hindus, Jews and adherents of folk religions are expected to grow in absolute numbers in the coming decades, none of these groups will keep pace with global population growth.\nWorldwide, the number of Hindus is projected to rise by 27%, from 1.1 billion to 1.4 billion, lagging slightly behind the pace of overall population growth. Jews, the smallest religious group for which separate projections were made, are expected to grow by 15%, from 14.3 million in 2015 to 16.4 million worldwide in 2060.5 And adherents of various folk religions – including African traditional religions, Chinese folk religions, Native American religions and Australian aboriginal religions, among others – are projected to increase by 5%, from 418 million to 441 million.\nBuddhists, meanwhile, are projected to decline in absolute number, dropping 7% from nearly 500 million in 2015 to 462 million in 2060. Low fertility rates and aging populations in countries such as China, Thailand and Japan are the main demographic reasons for the expected shrinkage in the Buddhist population in the years ahead.\nAll other religions combined – an umbrella category that includes Baha’is, Jains, Sikhs, Taoists and many smaller faiths – also are projected to decrease slightly in number, from a total of approximately 59.7 million in 2015 to 59.4 million in 2060.6\nThe religiously unaffiliated population is projected to shrink as a percentage of the global population, even though it will increase modestly in absolute number. In 2015, there were slightly fewer than 1.2 billion atheists, agnostics and people who did not identify with any particular religion around the world.7 By 2060, the unaffiliated population is expected to reach 1.2 billion. But as a share of all people in the world, religious “nones” are projected to decline from 16% of the total population in 2015 to 13% in 2060. While the unaffiliated are expected to continue to increase as a share the population in much of Europe and North America, people with no religion will decline as a share of the population in Asia, where 75% of the world’s religious “nones” live.\nGeographic differences like these play a major role in patterns of religious growth. Indeed, one of the main determinants of future growth is where each group is geographically concentrated today. For example, the religiously unaffiliated population is heavily concentrated in places with aging populations and low fertility, such as China, Japan, Europe and North America. By contrast, religions with many adherents in developing countries – where birth rates are high and infant mortality rates generally have been falling – are likely to grow quickly. Much of the worldwide growth of Islam and Christianity, for example, is expected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe regional distribution of religious groups is also expected to shift in the coming decades. For example, the share of Christians worldwide who live in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to increase dramatically between 2015 and 2060, from 26% to 42%, due to high fertility in the region. Meanwhile, religious switching and lower fertility will drive down the shares of the global Christian population living in Europe and North America.\nSub-Saharan Africa is also expected to be home to a growing share of the world’s Muslims. By 2060, 27% of the global Muslim population is projected to be living in the region, up from 16% in 2015. By contrast, the share of Muslims living in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to decline over the period from 61% to 50%. The share of Muslims in the Middle East and North Africa is expected to hold steady at 20%.\nAs of 2015, three-in-four unaffiliated people live in Asia and the Pacific. But that share is expected to decline to 66% by 2060 due to low fertility and an aging population. At the same time, a growing share of the unaffiliated will live outside of the Asia-Pacific, particularly in Europe and North America. By 2060, 9% of the global unaffiliated population will live in the United States alone, according to the projections.\nThe vast majority of Hindus and Buddhists (98-99%) will continue to live in the Asia-Pacific region in the next several decades. Most adherents of folk religions, too, will remain in Asia and the Pacific (79% in 2060), although a growing share are expected to live sub-Saharan Africa (7% in 2015 vs. 16% in 2060). Roughly equal shares of the world’s Jews live in Israel (42%) and the United States in 2015 (40%). But, by 2060, over half of all Jews (53%) are projected to live in Israel, while the U.S. is expected to have a smaller share (32%).\nThe current age distribution of each religious group is an important determinant of demographic growth. Some groups’ adherents are predominantly young, with their prime childbearing years still ahead, while members of other groups are older and largely past their childbearing years. The median ages of Muslims (24 years) and Hindus (27) are younger than the median age of the world’s overall population (30), while the median age of Christians (30) matches the global median. All the other groups are older than the global median, which is part of the reason why they are expected to fall behind the pace of global population growth.8\nMoreover, Muslims have the highest fertility rate of any religious group – an average of 2.9 children per woman, well above replacement level (2.1), the minimum typically needed to maintain a stable population.9 Christians are second, at 2.6 children per woman. Hindu and Jewish fertility (2.3 each) are both just below the global average of 2.4 children per woman. All other groups have fertility levels too low to sustain their populations.\nPew Research Center projections attempt to incorporate patterns of religious switching in 70 countries where surveys provide information on the number of people who say they no longer belong to the religious group in which they were raised.10 In the projection model, all directions of switching are possible, and they may partially offset one another. In the United States, for example, surveys find that although it is particularly common for people who grew up as Christians to become unaffiliated, some people who were raised with no religious affiliation also have switched to become Christians.11 These types of patterns are projected to continue as future generations come of age. (For more details on how and where switching was modeled, see Appendix B: Methodology.)\nBetween 2015 and 2020, Christians are projected to experience the largest losses due to switching. Globally, about 5 million people are expected to become Christians in this five-year period, while 13 million are expected to leave Christianity, with most of these departures joining the ranks of the religiously unaffiliated.\nThe unaffiliated are projected to add 12 million and lose 4.6 million via switching, for a net gain of 7.6 million between 2015 and 2020. The projected net changes due to switching for other religious groups are smaller.\nAlthough current patterns of religious switching favor the growth of the religiously unaffiliated population – particularly in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand – religious “nones” are projected to decline as a share of the world’s population in the coming decades due to a combination of low fertility and an older age profile.\nBetween 2015 and 2020, religious “nones” are projected to experience a net gain of 7.6 million people due to religious switching; people who grew up as Christians are expected to make up the overwhelming majority of those who switch into the unaffiliated group.12 Still, if current religious switching patterns continue, gains made through religious disaffiliation will not be large enough to make up for population losses due to other demographic factors.\nFor example, the 2015 to 2020 total fertility rate for religiously unaffiliated women is projected to be 1.6 children per woman, nearly a full child less than the rate of 2.5 children per woman for religiously affiliated women. And although religious “nones” tend to be younger than religiously affiliated people in the United States, the opposite is true at the global level: Unaffiliated women are older than the affiliated and thus more likely to be past their prime childbearing years. In 2015, the global median age for the female unaffiliated population was 36, compared with 30 for the religiously affiliated.\nThese demographic patterns are heavily influenced by the situation in Asia, and particularly China, which was home to 61% of the world’s unaffiliated population in 2015.\nWhat Americans believe and expect about the global size of religious groups\nBefore releasing projections of the future size of religious groups in 2015, Pew Research Center asked members of the American Trends Panel a few questions about their perceptions of the global religious landscape – and their expectations for its future.\nAbout half of Americans (52%) have an accurate idea of which religious group is currently the largest in the world, correctly saying that Christians make up the largest religious group, while a quarter think (incorrectly) that Muslims are largest. Fewer U.S. adults say that people with no religion (15%) or Hindus (6%) are the largest religious group.\nThe survey also asked Americans how they expect the share of the global population with no religion to change in the coming decades. Most Americans (62%) predict that the global share of religious “nones” will increase between now and 2050 – an expectation perhaps colored by what is happening on a national level.\nIndeed, in the U.S. and many other Western nations, the unaffiliated share of the population has been increasing and is expected to continue to rise as many Christians and others shed their religious identity and as younger, less religious generations replace older, more religious ones. However, because most religious “nones” live in Asia, where the religiously unaffiliated population is relatively old and has relatively low fertility, Pew Research Center projects that the global unaffiliated population will decline in the decades ahead, even after factoring in expected gains via religious switching. Only 15% of U.S. adults surveyed expect that people with no religion will decline as a share of the global population by 2050.13\nAsked which group they expect to have the most adherents globally in 2050, Americans are closely divided among those who say religious “nones” (33%), Christians (32%) and Muslims (29%). A small share (4%) anticipates that Hindus will be the largest group.\nExpectations about which group will become the largest vary by respondents’ age, religion and political party affiliation. For instance, nearly half (46%) of U.S. adults under 30 predict that people with no religion will outnumber Christians, Muslims and Hindus in 2050, while only about three-in-ten of those ages 50 and older anticipate that religious “nones” will be the largest group at mid-century. Meanwhile, older Americans are more likely than young adults (under 30) to say that Muslims will be the largest group.\nChristians are more likely than religious “nones” to say that Christians will be the largest group in 2050 (36% vs. 22%). And the unaffiliated are more likely than Christians to say people with no religion will be the largest group at mid-century: 44% of religious “nones” say this will be the case, compared with 31% of Christians.\nDifferences in expectations about the future size of religious groups also are apparent across the political spectrum. Americans who identify with or lean toward the Republican Party are more likely than those who identify as or lean Democratic to predict that Muslims will make up the largest religious group in the world in 2050 (36% vs. 25%). By contrast, Democrats are more likely than Republicans (35% vs. 29%) to expect that people with no religion will be the largest group.\nHow births and deaths are changing religious populations\nAs the world’s largest religious group, Christians had the most births and deaths of any group between 2010 and 2015. During this five-year period, an estimated 223 million babies were born to Christian mothers and roughly 107 million Christians died, meaning that the natural increase in the Christian population – i.e., the number of births minus the number of deaths – was 116 million over this period.\nMuslims had the second-largest number of births between 2010 and 2015, with 213 million babies born to Muslim mothers. But Muslims saw the largest natural increase of any religious group – more than 152 million people – due to the relatively small number of Muslim deaths (61 million). This large natural increase results from both high Muslim fertility and the concentration of the Muslim population in younger age groups, which have lower mortality rates.\nCompared with the overall size of the religiously unaffiliated population (16% of the world’s people), there were relatively few recent births to unaffiliated mothers (10% of all births between 2010 and 2015). Religious “nones” are the third-largest group overall, and yet due to lower levels of fertility, they rank fourth behind Hindus in terms of babies born. Between 2010 and 2015, an estimated 68 million babies were born to unaffiliated mothers, compared with 109 million to Hindu mothers. Hindus also saw a much larger natural increase than the religiously unaffiliated (67 million vs. 26 million).\nBirths also outnumbered deaths among other major religious groups between 2010 and 2015, including among Buddhists, Jews and members of folk or traditional religions.\nBeyond 2015, Christian and Muslim mothers are expected to give birth to increasing numbers of babies through 2060. But Muslim births are projected to rise at a faster rate – so much so that by 2035 the number of babies born to Muslim mothers will narrowly surpass the number born to Christian mothers. Between 2055 and 2060, the birth gap between the two groups is expected to approach 6 million (232 million births among Muslims vs. 226 million births among Christians).\nBy contrast, the total number of births is projected to decline steadily between 2015 and 2060 for all other major religious groups. The drop-off in births will be especially dramatic for Hindus – who are expected to see 33 million fewer births between 2055 and 2060 than between 2010 and 2015 – due in large part to declining fertility in India, which is home to 94% of the global Hindu population as of 2015.\nThe number of deaths is projected to increase for all religious groups between 2015 and 2060, as the world’s population continues to grow – and grow older. 14\nFor religious groups in most countries, there is currently either positive natural increase (more births than deaths) or little net change due to births and deaths. But many European countries are experiencing a natural decrease (more deaths than births) in the populations of certain religious groups, especially Christians.\nThroughout Eastern Europe and parts of Western Europe, deaths outnumbered births among Christians between 2010 and 2015 in 24 of 42 countries. Deaths also outnumbered births by at least 10,000 among religiously unaffiliated populations in Austria, Ukraine and Russia. But religious “nones” in most European countries saw either a positive natural increase (in 19 countries) or little net change during the period from 2010 to 2015 (in 20 countries). This reflects the relatively young age profile of the religiously unaffiliated compared with the Christian population in Europe.\nAmong Muslims, there were no European countries where the number of deaths exceeded the number of births. Throughout most of the region, the number of babies born to Muslim women exceeded the number of Muslim deaths between 2010 and 2015 (in 21 countries). In Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia and France, there were at least 250,000 more Muslim births than deaths in each country over that period. At the same time, migration is also driving Muslim population growth in Europe.\nNo Christian, Muslim or unaffiliated populations living in countries outside of Europe experienced more deaths than births in the 2010 to 2015 period. Similarly, other religious groups saw either positive natural increase or little net change, with a few exceptions: Buddhists in Japan, Hindus in South Africa and adherents of folk religions in South Korea and Tanzania had a larger number of deaths than births between 2010 and 2015.\nThere are important regional differences in birth and death trends for some religious groups. Among Christians, for example, sub-Saharan Africa experienced the biggest natural increase between 2010 and 2015 – with 64 million more births than deaths – followed by smaller Christian increases in Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific and North America.\nIn Europe, however, Christian deaths already outnumber births – a deficit that is projected to grow through 2060. And in North America, the number of Christian deaths will begin to exceed the number of births by around 2050.\nThese trends signal that much of Christianity’s future growth is likely to be in the global South, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa – the only region where natural increases in the Christian population are expected to grow even larger in the coming decades. (This means that not only will there continue to be more Christian births than deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, but births will exceed deaths by even larger numbers in upcoming five-year periods.) In Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, the number of Christian births will continue to exceed the number of deaths through 2060, but the natural increases in the 2055 to 2060 time period will be much smaller than they are now as these regions experience significant declines in fertility.\nThe global Muslim population also is projected to undergo an important geographic shift toward sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, more Muslims live in Asia and the Pacific than in any other region, and as a result, this region had the largest natural increase in the Muslim population between 2010 and 2015.\nBut sub-Saharan Africa’s Muslims also experienced far more births than deaths during this period, and the natural increases in the Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa are projected to grow even larger in the five-year periods ahead, driven by high fertility. By about 2040, the natural increase in the Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to exceed the natural increase in Asia.\nMuslims in Asia and the Middle East-North Africa region will experience slower growth in the coming decades as Muslim fertility in these regions declines. These populations will continue to have more births than deaths through 2060, but they will grow at a slower rate.\nMuslims in Europe and North America also are expected to have more births than deaths through 2060.\nCurrently, there are more births than deaths among religious “nones” in all regions, led by the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to a majority of the global religiously unaffiliated population.\nBut this will change in the coming years. For people with no religion in Asia, the number of deaths will begin to exceed the number of births to unaffiliated mothers by 2030, a change driven by low fertility and a relatively old unaffiliated population in China. By 2035, unaffiliated deaths are expected to outnumber births in Europe as well.\nThe five-year periods described in this report represent midyear to midyear time spans – for example, from July 1, 2030, to June 30, 2035 – which are standard units used in demography and by organizations including the United Nations Population Division. ↩\nWhen these projections are extended beyond 2060, Muslims are expected to reach parity with Christians in 2070. By 2075, Muslims are expected to outnumber Christians, even as both groups continue to increase as a share of the world’s population, largely due to their concentration in countries with relatively high fertility rates. By 2100, Muslims are expected to make up 34.9% of the world’s population and Christians to make up 33.8%. ↩\nJews are such a small share of the global population, however, that the projected change is not visible when percentages are rounded to one decimal place. Jews constituted 0.20% of the world’s population in 2015 and are projected to constitute 0.17% in 2060. Both figures round to 0.2% (two-tenths of 1%) in the charts and tables in this report. ↩\nThese projections are based on estimates of people who self-identify as Jewish when asked about their religion on national censuses and large-scale surveys. They do not include “cultural” or “ethnic” Jews – people who have direct Jewish ancestry and who consider themselves at least partially Jewish but who describe themselves, religiously, as atheist, agnostic or nothing in particular. For the purposes of the religious group projections in this report, these people are categorized as unaffiliated. The worldwide estimate of Jews could be larger if this group were included, or smaller if a narrower definition of who is Jewish (such as an unbroken line of matrilineal Jewish descent) were used. ↩\nAlthough some faiths in the “other religions” category have millions of adherents around the world, censuses and surveys in many countries do not measure them specifically. Because of the scarcity of census and survey data, Pew Research Center has not projected the size of individual religions within this category. Estimates of the global size of these faiths generally come from other sources, such as the religious groups themselves. By far the largest of these groups is Sikhs, who numbered about 25 million in 2015, according to the World Religion Database. ↩\nIn many countries, censuses and demographic surveys do not enumerate atheists and agnostics as distinct populations, so it is not possible to reliably estimate the global size of these subgroups within the broad category of the unaffiliated. ↩\nExpected changes to the religious landscape among older adults are discussed in Skirbekk, Vegard, Michaela Potančoková, Conrad Hackett and Marcin Stonawski. November 2016. “Religious Affiliation Among Older Age Groups Worldwide: Estimates for 2010 and Projections Until 2050.” The Journals of Gerontology Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences Series B. ↩\nThe standard measure of fertility in this report is the total fertility rate. In countries with low infant and child mortality rates, a total fertility rate close to 2.1 children per woman is sufficient for each generation to replace itself. Replacement-level fertility is higher in countries with elevated mortality rates. ↩\nThese 70 countries were home to 43% of the world’s population in 2010, and they include many countries where switching between having a religious affiliation and not having a religious affiliation is common, such as the United States, France, Australia and New Zealand. The most populous countries for which switching was not modeled are China and India. Prior to this study, the most extensive analysis of religious switching covered 40 countries. See Barro, Robert J., Jason Hwang and Rachel McCleary. 2010. “Religious Conversion in 40 Countries.” Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. It is difficult to formally project religious switching in China without reliable information on recent or likely patterns of switching. For example, it is not clear at what rate people in China may be converting to Christianity from other groups, and retention patterns among Christians are not known. Nor is it clear at what rate Islam, Buddhism and other faiths may be gaining adherents in China. If China experiences a net movement toward religious affiliation via switching in the decades ahead, that would tilt the needle toward a more religiously affiliated global population, particularly since China is currently home to a majority of the worldwide unaffiliated population. When these projections were made, no current, nationally representative survey of Indians was available to provide reliable data on both respondents’ childhood religion and on their current religious affiliation (the basis for calculating switching rates). However, a 1990 World Values Survey in India found that nearly all Indian respondents who grew up as Hindu still identified as Hindu. ↩\nStudies of religious switching indicate that this phenomenon is often concentrated in young adult years, roughly between ages 15 and 29. Change in religious affiliation may occur as young adults move away from their parents and partner with someone of a different affiliation status. While some religious switching may take place at other ages, switching is modeled as a life course phenomenon in which some young adults change their religious affiliation status. There may be some time periods during which people of all ages are prone to religious switching, such as when political circumstances in a country encourage or discourage religious identity or lack of religious identity.

The survey questions discussed in this sidebar were developed before the first report was released, which is why they ask about expectations for the size of religious groups in 2050 (rather than 2060). ↩\nThese projections do not take into account potential future medical or technological advancements that could increase lifespans. ↩\nThe Changing Global Religious Landscape\nThis report was produced by Pew Research Center as part of the Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures project, which analyzes religious change and its impact on societies around the world.

Grim; visiting Senior Research Fellow Mehtab Karim; and former Research Analyst Noble Kuriakose. Additionally, Guy Abel, professor at the School of Sociology and Political Science at Shanghai University, helped construct the country-level migration flow data used in the projections.\nWhile the data collection and projection methodology were guided by our consultants and advisers, Pew Research Center is solely responsible for the interpretation and reporting of the data.\nThis report is part of the Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures population projections project that produced the 2015 report “The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050.” The figures described in this report, including estimated births and deaths by religion and 2015 global population sizes, have not been previously reported. This report also presents results from a November 2014 survey that asked U.S. adults which religious group they think is largest and their expectations for religious change in the decades ahead.\nThis appendix describes unique aspects of the methodology for this report. A description of the full projections methodology that accompanied the 2015 report is included as Appendix C. Note that Appendix C extensively discusses the 2010 baseline for the projections. The results in this report focus on expected change between 2010 and 2015, including estimates of 2015 population sizes, as well as expected change through 2060.\nAppendix D lists the sources used for each country. Appendix E describes the major religious group categories. Finally, Appendix F is a topline describing the November 2014 survey results.\nThe remainder of this appendix briefly describes the methodology behind the population projections and how births and deaths were estimated for this report. It also describes the American Trends Panel, on which the November 2014 survey was conducted.\nAbout the population projections\nWhile many people have offered predictions about the future of religion, Pew Research Center has undertaken the first formal demographic projections using data on age, fertility, mortality, migration and religious switching for multiple religious groups around the world. Demographers at Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, gathered the input data from more than 2,500 censuses, surveys and population registers since 2009.15\nThe projections cover eight major groups: Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, adherents of folk religions, adherents of other religions and the unaffiliated. Because censuses and surveys in many countries do not provide information on religious subgroups – such as Sunni and Shia Muslims or Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox Christians – the projections are for each religious group as a whole. Data on subgroups of the unaffiliated are also unavailable in many countries. As a result, separate projections are not possible for atheists or agnostics.\nThe projection model was developed in collaboration with researchers who are world leaders in population projections methodology at the Age and Cohort Change Project at IIASA. The model uses an advanced version of the cohort-component method typically employed by demographers to forecast population growth. It starts with a population of baseline age groups, or cohorts, divided by sex and religion. Each cohort is projected into the future by adding likely gains (immigrants and people switching in) and by subtracting likely losses (deaths, emigrants and people switching out) year by year. The youngest cohorts, ages 0 to 4, are created by applying age-specific fertility rates to each female cohort in the childbearing years (ages 15 to 49), with children inheriting the mother’s religion.16\nIn the process of gathering input data and developing the projection model, Pew Research Center previously published reports on the current size and geographic distribution of major religious groups, including Muslims (2009), Christians (2011) and several other faiths (2012). An initial set of projections for one religious group, Muslims, was published in 2011, although it did not attempt to take religious switching into account. The first report on these projections was published in 2015.\nSome social theorists have suggested that as countries develop economically, more of their inhabitants will move away from religious affiliation. While that has been the general experience in some parts of the world, notably Europe, it is not yet clear whether it is a universal pattern.17 In any case, the projections in this report are not based on theories about economic development leading to secularization.\nRather, the projections extend the recently observed patterns of religious switching in all countries for which sufficient data are available (70 countries in all). In addition, the projections reflect the United Nations Population Division’s expectation that in countries with high fertility rates, those rates gradually will decline in coming decades, alongside rising female educational attainment. And the projections assume that people gradually are living longer in most countries.\nSome cautionary words about these projections are essential. Population projections are estimates built on current population data and assumptions about demographic trends, such as declining birth rates and rising life expectancies in particular countries. The projections are what will occur if the current data are accurate and current trends continue. But many events – scientific discoveries, armed conflicts, social movements, political upheavals, natural disasters and changing economic conditions, to name just a few – can shift demographic trends in unforeseen ways. For example, China’s 1.4 billion people (as of 2015) loom very large in global trends. At present, about 5% of China’s population is estimated to be Christian, and more than 51% is religiously unaffiliated. Because reliable figures on religious switching in China are not available, the projections do not contain any forecast for conversions in the world’s most populous country. But if Christianity expands in China in the decades to come – as some experts predict – then by 2060, the global numbers of Christians may be higher than projected, and the decline in the percentage of the world’s population that is religiously unaffiliated may be even sharper than projected.18\nFinally, readers should bear in mind that within every major religious group, there is a spectrum of belief and practice. The projections are based on the number of people who self-identify with each religious group, regardless of their level of observance. What it means to be Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish or a member of any other faith may vary from person to person, country to country, and decade to decade.\nFor a more complete description of the projections methodology that accompanied the 2015 report, see Appendix C.\nEstimates of births and deaths\nThis report is based on new analysis of previously unreleased data from the population projections described in Pew Research Center’s 2015 report, “The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050.” This is the first report to publish estimates of global births and deaths by religion. Estimates of births and deaths by religion are generated from a population projection model incorporating data on each group’s fertility rates, age and sex distribution and the prevailing mortality rates in the countries where each group is concentrated. Unfortunately, vital statistics data recording parent’s religion at birth and one’s religion at death are generally not collected, so estimates of births and deaths by religion at the global level must be estimated rather than directly measured.\nReligious composition in 2015 is projected from a 2010 baseline. The projection model is built on the assumption that fertility and mortality rates will decline over time in countries that begin with high fertility and mortality rates. For the 70 countries with available data, these projections take into account patterns of religious switching. Projection results reported here extend to the year 2060.\nAlthough this report contains different data points than the 2015 report, they share the same input data and projection modeling. Updating all the input data for global religious projections is a monumental undertaking, and in many countries the new data necessary for this work will not be available until the 2020 wave of government censuses are complete. The Center’s prior global projection report focused on 2010 and 2050. By focusing on the year 2015, this report provides a more up-to-date estimate of the global religious landscape.\nThe American Trends Panel (ATP)\nData for the sidebar “What Americans believe and expect about the global size of religious groups” in this report are drawn from the November 2014 wave of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), a nationally representative panel of randomly selected U.S. adults living in households. This wave of the ATP was conducted Nov. 17 to Dec. 15, 2014 among 3,212 respondents (2,856 by web and 356 by mail). The margin of sampling error for the full sample of 3,212 respondents is plus or minus 2.3 percentage points.\nAt the time the November 2014 wave of the ATP was conducted, respondents who self-identified as internet users (representing 89% of U.S. adults) participated in the panel via monthly self-administered web surveys; those who did not use the internet participated via telephone or mail. The panel is managed by Abt SRBI.\nAll members of the American Trends Panel as of November 2014 were originally recruited from the 2014 Political Polarization and Typology Survey, a large (n=10,013) national landline and cellphone random-digit dial (RDD) survey conducted Jan. 23 to March 16, 2014, in English and Spanish. At the end of that survey, respondents were invited to join the panel. The invitation was extended to all respondents who use the internet (from any location) and a random subsample of respondents who do not use the internet.19\nOf the 10,013 adults interviewed, 9,809 were invited to take part in the panel. A total of 5,338 agreed to participate and provided either a mailing address or an email address to which a welcome packet, a monetary incentive and future survey invitations could be sent. Panelists also receive a small monetary incentive after participating in each wave of the survey.\nThe ATP data were weighted in a multistep process that begins with a base weight incorporating the respondents’ original survey selection probability and the fact that some panelists were subsampled for invitation to the panel. Next, an adjustment was made for the fact that the propensity to join the panel and remain an active panelist varied across different groups in the sample. The final step in the weighting uses an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin and region to parameters from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2012 American Community Survey. Population density is weighted to match the 2010 U.S. Decennial Census. Telephone service is weighted to estimates of telephone coverage for 2014 that were projected from the National Health Interview Survey conducted from July to December 2013. It also adjusts for party affiliation using an average of the three most recent Pew Research Center general public telephone surveys, and for internet use using as a parameter a measure from the 2014 Survey of Political Polarization. Sampling errors and statistical tests of significance take into account the effect of weighting. The Hispanic sample in the American Trends Panel is predominantly native born and English speaking.\nThe following table shows the unweighted sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey:\nIn addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.\nThe web component of the November 2014 wave had a response rate of 78% (2,856 responses among 3,66320 web-based individuals enrolled in the panel); the mail component had a response rate of 68% (356 responses among 521 non-web individuals enrolled in the panel). Taking account of the response rate for the 2014 Survey of Political Polarization (10.6%), the cumulative response rate for the November 2014 ATP wave is 3.5%.\nSince November 2014, several additional waves of the ATP have been conducted. For more information about the ATP, see http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/u-s-survey-research/american-trends-panel/.\nResearch carried out at IIASA was also supported by a European Research Council grant (ERC-2009 StG 241003-COHORT) to Vegard Skirbekk. ↩\nHow accurate have population projections using the cohort-component method been in the past? An overview of how previous projections for general populations compare with actual population trends is provided in the National Research Council’s 2000 book “Beyond Six Billion: Forecasting the World’s Population.” ↩\nFor example, there is little evidence of economic development leading to religious disaffiliation in Muslim-majority countries. In Hindu-majority India, religious affiliation remains nearly universal despite rapid social and economic change. And in China, religious affiliation – though very difficult to measure – may be rising along with economic development. ↩\nAlthough there are many news stories and anecdotes about Christian growth in China, there is little nationally representative survey data from this century that clearly validates these reports. In “A Star in the East: The Rise of Christianity in China,” Rodney Stark and Xiuhua Wang also argue that Christianity in China is growing rapidly. However, they report that survey data commissioned from Horizon Ltd. found exactly the same share of Protestants and Catholics in 2007 and 2014 despite the authors’ expectation that the 2014 survey would find clear evidence of rapid Christian growth in the intervening years. ↩\nWhen data collection for the 2014 Political Polarization and Typology Survey began, non-internet users were subsampled at a rate of 25%, but a decision was made shortly thereafter to invite all non-internet users to join. In total, 83% of non-internet users were invited to join the panel. ↩\nPrior to the October wave, 962 web panelists who had never responded were removed from the panel. Prior to the November wave, 37 mail panelists who had never responded were removed from the panel. The web response rate including these panelists would have been 62%. The mail response rate including these panelists would have been 64%. ↩"},{"url":"https://ensia.com/notable/environmental-trends-2017","title":"From electronic noses to invasive bees, 15 surprising trends for 2017","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Ensia","description":"What should we be thinking about when we think about the future of biodiversity, conservation and the environment?

The answers they came up, just published in the scientific journal Trends in Ecology \u0026 Evolution and summarized below, portend both risks and opportunities for species and ecosystems around the world.\n“Our aim has been to focus attention and stimulate debate about these subjects, potentially leading to new research foci, policy developments, or business innovations,” the authors wrote in introducing their list of top trends to watch in 2017. “These responses should help facilitate better-informed forward-planning.”\nAltering Coral Bacteria\nAround the world, coral reefs are bleaching and dying as ocean temperatures warm beyond those tolerated by bacteria that live in partnership with the corals. Scientists are eyeing the option of replacing bacteria forced out by heat with other strains more tolerant of the new temperatures — either naturally occurring or genetically engineered. Although the practice holds promise for rescuing or resurrecting damaged reefs, there are concerns about unintended consequences such as introduction of disease or disruption of ecosystems.\nUnderwater Robots Meet Invasive Species\nIf you think getting rid of invasive species on land is a challenge, you haven’t tried doing it in the depths of the ocean. Robots that can crawl across the seafloor dispatching invaders with poisons or electric shock are being investigated as a potential tool for combating such species. The technology is now being tested to control crown-of-thorns starfish, which have devastated Great Barrier Reef corals in recent years, and invasive lionfish, which are competing with native species in the Caribbean Sea.\nElectronic Noses\nThe technology behind electronic sensors that detect odors has advanced markedly in recent years, leading biologists to ponder applications to conservation. Possibilities include using the devices to sniff out illegally traded wildlife at checkpoints along transportation routes and to detect the presence of DNA from rare species in the environment.\nBlight of the Bumblebees\nWe tend to think of pollinating insects as our ecological friends, but in the wrong place nonnative bees can spell trouble instead by competing with native insects, promoting reproduction in nonnative plants and potentially spreading disease. And they’re doing just that, thanks to people who transport them internationally for plant-pollination purposes. Out-of-place bumblebees are already spreading through New Zealand, Japan and southern South America, and there is concern they could do the same in Australia, Brazil, Uruguay, China, South Africa and Namibia.\nMicrobes Meet Agriculture\nSelect bacteria and fungi are emerging as potential agricultural allies for their ability to help kick back pests or stimulate growth in crops. As research advances in this area, questions are being raised about potential implications for nontarget species, ecosystems, soils and more.\nSand Trap\nSand is mined for a wide range of uses, from making concrete, glass, asphalt and electronics to reclaiming land and aiding in the extraction of fossil fuels. And with sand mining comes disruption and loss of habitat in sand sources such as quarries, rivers, lakes and oceans. As demand for sand grows, efforts are underway to develop strategies for restoring areas from which sand has been removed and to advance the use of alternative materials such as mud or recycled construction material where possible to reduce stress on existing stocks.\nTrends in Fences\nFences are notorious for challenging wildlife by restricting migrations and limiting contact among populations. As political leaders in the U.S. and Europe make plans to build more border fences to limit movement of our own species across national boundaries, scientists are assessing implications for wolves, sheep, bears, birds and more.\nDownside of Cleanups\nLandfills have altered animal behavior, distribution and abundance around the world in a variety of ways, from increasing abundance of storks to fragmenting populations of bears. As changes in regulations cause landfills to be cleaned up, covered and closed, scientists expect the behavior of scavenging animals to change — with potential consequences for other species, ecosystems and human-animal interactions.\nOcean Air on Overdrive\nThings can be rough on the open ocean — and they appear to be getting rougher, with increased average air speed, wave height, and frequency of strong winds and large waves over the past two decades. Implications for ecosystems and the species that inhabit them include disruptions to beaches, coastal vegetation and reefs; ocean-going birds and transoceanic migrants also could be affected.\nFloating Wind Farms\nFloating turbines hold huge promise for capturing wind energy over Earth’s oceans. With the first large floating wind farm — off the coast of Scotland — approved for development in 2016 and some 40 more in planning, it’s high time to take a look at potential implications for conservation. Possibilities include the creation of de facto marine reserves as fish cluster under the fields of floating turbines, loss of birds that fly into the turbines, entanglement of sea creatures in cables used to tether the turbines to the seafloor, and disruption of movement patterns of underwater animals.\nPlants have the renewable energy storage problem pretty well figured out: Capture photons from the sun, use them to split water into hydrogen and oxygen to make sugars, then extract the energy from the sugars when it’s needed. New “artificial leaf” technologies use sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, then feed the hydrogen to bacteria that make energy-storing alcohol — at energy conversion efficiencies approaching 10 times that of nature’s version. The technology opens the door to an exciting new approach to capturing, storing and using solar energy in locations remote from electrical grids.\nLithium-Air Batteries\nThe lack of dense energy storage systems is a big barrier to widespread adoption of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, which are only intermittently available, as well as to the advancement of technologies such as electric vehicles. A new kid on the energy-storage block, lithium-air batteries, can theoretically hold 10 times as much energy per volume as its conventional lithium-ion counterparts. Although scientists expect the technology to take 10 years or more to mature, when it does it could revolutionize renewable energy markets with cascading impacts for land use, water quality and more.\nBetter Biofuel Production\nA class of enzymes known as lyctic polysaccharide monooxygenases is emerging as a potentially powerful tool for use in converting plant material to liquid fuel and industrial chemicals. By dramatically improving the speed and efficiency of conversion over conventional approaches, these enzymes could stimulate efforts to grow crops for fuel, with implications for biodiversity in the form of increased land use for this purpose, potential shifts away from fossil fuel use and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\nResearchers in Iceland have come up with a promising strategy for storing carbon dioxide underground: Dissolve it in water and inject it into basaltic rocks. After two years of monitoring an experimental site, they’ve discovered the approach does a remarkable job of long-term storage, with 95 percent of the CO2 injected turning into rock. Although the process is energy- and water-intensive, there is hope it could play a role in reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and minimizing the impact of climate change on the rest of the world.\nNew Jobs for Blockchain\nBest known for enabling a Web-based currency known as bitcoin, blockchain technology in a more generalized sense offers the ability to track transactions without the need for a centralized record keeper. As the technology matures, potential applications with implications for conservation include tracking land claims, providing a system for buying and selling power generated by distributed renewable sources, ensuring the validity of sustainability claims for products such as seafood and lumber, and uncovering illegal wildlife trade.\nWondering how last year’s projections have fared so far?

Bezerra lost the money, not to mention the $50 he paid to join U2’s fan club so he could purchase the tickets in a presale.\nEvent promoters say restricted tickets that require the credit card or a photo ID benefit fans by thwarting scalpers. These tickets are usually nontransferable or can be sold only on the promoter’s or original ticketseller’s resale website — not on independent sites such as StubHub. These are often called paperless tickets, but not all paperless tickets are nontransferable.\n“The movement to paperless ticketing makes it difficult, sometimes impossible, to transfer tickets. They are like airline tickets. You buy a ticket in your name, you have to go,” said John Kwoka, an economics professor at Northeastern University who studies antitrust issues.\nSome states including New York and Virginia have passed laws that require ticket issuers to offer them in a freely transferable format that can be sold on any resale site.

The bill eventually didn’t include the protections we expected to see.”\nLevi’s Stadium couldn’t help Bezerra because when it hosts non-football events, the event promoter sets the ticketing policy, said Roger Hacker, a spokesman for the stadium. The stadium was informed that for its North American Joshua Tree tour, U2 and promoter Live Nation are issuing paperless tickets that require a credit card to be presented for entry for all general admission and fan club presale seats.\n“If a patron purchased under these circumstances, the policy was clearly identified and explained prior to the completion of the ticket purchase,” Hacker said in an email. “The intent was to counter the efforts of ticket brokers from using the fan club presale and general admission tickets for resale.”\nBezerra said his wife purchased the U2 tickets because he was at work during the presale. She did not see any warning about the restrictions, but fans had to make their purchases quickly, leaving little time to read fine print, he said.\nWhen he got the purchase confirmation, it said: “Restrictions apply: Proof of credit card used for purchase and valid ID may be required for entry. Tickets are nontransferable.”\nBut when Bezerra realized he couldn’t go, he got confused because he saw loads of tickets to the U2 concert for sale on StubHub, including ones in the same section as his.\nBezerra said he called Ticketmaster twice to see if he could get a refund or sell his tickets. The last of three people he spoke to, Amanda, said she would call the “management company.” She called back and said there was nothing she could do.\nBezerra also emailed the subscriber department at U2.com and got an email back that said, “We only deal with the fan club portion of the business. We do not handle ticket sales or assist with customer service for orders placed.”\nLive Nation and U2.com did not respond to requests for comment. Ticketmaster would only confirm that for U2 concerts nationwide, general admission and fan club seats are credit-card entry only. Other reserved seats purchased in the general sale can be transferred or sold.\nThere are many tickets for remaining U2 concerts listed for resale on StubHub, including general admission seats. StubHub spokesman Cameron Papp said a small number of “restricted access” tickets are sold on its site. When buyers click on these seats, a notice says, “Paperless tickets. Instructions for entry will be included in confirmation email.”\nThe StubHub buyer might have to meet the seller at the gate, Papp said. Or, the seller might send the buyer a gift card that was used to make the purchase. However, Ticketmaster says on its website that credit-card entry tickets cannot be purchased with a gift card, only a credit card.\nStubHub guarantees that anyone who purchases a ticket, restricted or not, will get into the event. In rare cases when no alternative tickets are available, their money will be refunded, Papp said.\nKathleen Pender is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.

They are saving a couple of hundred dollars on hundreds of thousands of dollars of potential sale.\nAhh, but you probably won’t listen to this logic.\nWhy?\nBecause in America, everyone who has a cellphone thinks they are a professional photographer.\nThey are not.\nSo if you are not going to listen, then at least follow this one piece of advice: Don’t use your iPhone; it’s a wrong number. It’s the visual equivalent of a robocall while you are having dinner. Dust off the 35mm camera, walk around your property, and look for the best angle.\nThink of yourself as an artist. If you are selling your own house, pretend you are a National Geographic photographer on assignment. Shoot exteriors only in the golden light, the time around sunrise and sunset when the lighting is dramatic. You have the home court advantage, so use it.\nTake for example this home in the Squantum section of Quincy pictured here at sunset. If you shoot it head on, you won’t even see the water at the bottom of the street. At 7 a.m., however, the second floor is ablaze with the reflecting sunrise and the deck is heavenly. You don’t even need to show the whole house. If you shoot it right, they will come.\nIt’s not just about location, location, location.\nPut a little fun in the photos. If you love the cardinal that stops by to eat berries every day, shoot a picture with a telephoto lens. If the trees outside the living room window make it feel like a forest, capture that scene before the leaves fall.\nShooting the interiors is more demanding. Real estate agents say buyers want to see decluttered spaces. Unfortunately, that is why my house will never be for sale. But for most neatniks, that means putting on an ultra-wide angle (a 16mm or 18mm) and showing as much of the interior as possible.\nTry for a dominant foreground and avoid tilting the camera to minimize distortion. Never, ever use straight flash. Instead, bounce the flash off the ceiling to provide a softer, more balanced light, or shoot when the light outside is equal to the light inside. This may mean using a tripod for a slow shutter speed or refraining from drinking while on the job to ensure a steady hand.\nHouses aren’t sterile, they have personalities and people live in them. My friend’s house sold quickly because it was a fine home that gave off good vibes. Your assignment is to capture all that you loved about your house on film. If you do this properly, there will soon be another family there, making their own memories and searching between the couch cushions for the remote control.\nStan Grossfeld can be reached at grossfeld@globe.com.

His daily press briefings have become must-see TV, and his national profile has been elevated thanks to the frequent lampooning by Saturday Night Live.\nNorm Eisen, co-founder of the government watchdog group CREW or Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the top ethics advisor to President Barack Obama, says if he were counseling this administration, he would encourage Spicer to skip the event.\n“There’s something very unique here, and that is the property. The Republicans are having this event at a property that is owned by Donald Trump. And they’re throwing in the presence of a senior White House staffer almost as a party favor,” Eisen said.\nAt issue is that Trump owns the golf course, Spicer works for Trump and, theoretically, the funds the Virginia GOP is spending to rent the facility will go directly back to Trump.\n“It’s known as a 2635.702 you can’t use public office for private gain and it’s been kind of an epidemic in the Trump Administration,” Eisen said.\nEisen and others point to other examples like White House advisor Kellyanne Conway giving a plug to Ivanka Trump’s clothing line from the White House briefing room in February.\nIn that instance, the Office of Government Ethics deemed that Conway had misused her official position and recommended the White House take disciplinary action.\nDuring a daily briefing, Spicer said Conway was “counseled.”\nIn March, when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin — who has been an executive producer on nearly 40 Hollywood films — was asked to during a Q \u0026 A with the media company Axios about a movie the audience should see, he responded with a qualified recommendation for one of his own films.\n“Well, I’m not allowed to promote anything that I’m involved in. So I just want to have the legal disclosure, you’ve asked me the question and I am not promoting any product…but you should send all your kids to Lego Batman,” he said.\nA Democratic Senator asked the OGE to look into the matter.\nThe Republican Party of Virginia declined to comment on tonight’s fundraiser in a recorded conversation, but via text, one official says he saw no ethics violations in the situation.\nThe official pointed to a similar circumstance last year when Tom Perez was the “special guest” at the annual Jefferson Jackson Dinner in Richmond hosted by the Virginia Democrats. Perez was Obama Administration’s Labor Secretary at the time.\nJames Thurber, who teaches political science at American University with a focus on ethics in the presidency and Congress, says that the problem isn’t with Spicer’s appearance per se.\n“Sean can certainly go out and give speeches at any Republican event. He will do that, other White House press secretaries have done that in the past. The question is profit for the Trump business organization,” Thurber said.\nHe noted that the appearance is legal, but said it’s in a gray area ethically.\nThurber added that, given the avalanche of news related to this White House in recent weeks, this possible ethics violation is one of the things that concerns him the least."},{"url":"https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/05/26/alameda-countys-homeless-population-climbs-dramatically-over-two-years","title":"Alameda County’s Homeless Population Climbs Dramatically Over Two Years","author_text":null,"keywords":["Alameda County","Homelessness","Housing","News"],"publication_text":"KQED News","description":"The counting method changed, but the main problem remains -- lack of housing.","date":"2017-05-26","full_text":"Alameda County’s homeless population grew by 39 percent over the past two years, according to biennial data released Thursday.\nThe estimated number of people on streets and in shelters in 2015 was 4,040, and now it’s up to 5,629. Part of the increase is because Alameda County changed the way it conducts the count, which led to more accurate numbers. But officials are mainly pointing fingers at high rents and the lack of affordable housing. It’s a problem that needs short- and long-term solutions, they say.\n“We know that housing is what will end homelessness, but in the meantime we’ve got people living on the streets now,” said Elaine de Coligny, executive director of EveryOne Home, which conducts the county’s homeless count.\nSome Takeaways From the Survey\nThe homeless count is conducted every two years on a night in late January. For the count on Jan. 30, 2017, Alameda County used 345 volunteers and paid 99 currently or recently homeless people to help volunteers walk individual census tracts, which allowed the county to cover more ground and get a more accurate count, de Coligny said.\nFour cities — Oakland, Berkeley, Hayward and Fremont — will receive more personalized reports soon that detail specifics for their respective cities. The county data released Thursday will be followed by a more comprehensive report in the summer. But here are some takeaways from the report:\nThere were 4,040 homeless people counted in 2015. That number increased to 5,629 in 2017.\n69 percent of the people counted were not sheltered (living on streets, in cars, etc.), which is about a 10 percent increase from 2015.\n82 percent of those surveyed said their prior residence was in Alameda County.\n58 percent have been homeless for at least one year.\nThe number of homeless veterans increase from 388 in 2015 to 531 in 2017.\nSee the full brief here.\nHere is the 2015 report.\nWhat Led to the Increase\nIn Alameda County, median rents have increased 25 percent since 2015, while median household income increased only by 5 percent, according to EveryOne Home. Stories about evictions and displacement have become commonplace as Bay Area cities react with temporary solutions like sanctioned encampments, rent control or other eviction protections.\nThe report found that 82 percent of people were living in Alameda County before they lost their home.\n“This data remind us that people who are homeless are our neighbors. They lived in Alameda County before they lost their homes and they stay here because this is home to them,” de Coligny said.\nBut homeless shelters and other programs are having trouble helping people find apartments and other homes because of the stiff competition. Many of those with housing vouchers are taking months to find a place.\nDe Coligny also believes that Proposition 57, which allows the early release of some nonviolent felons, has played a part in the higher number of homeless in Alameda County.\n“We haven’t put the return infrastructure in place to help people reintegrate, find housing and get jobs,” she said.\nWhat might also be contributing to the growing encampments in places like Oakland is the development happening in areas that have long been dormant, de Coligny said.\n“People who could be invisible during their homelessness are now being pushed into big encampments,” she said.\nGrowing Encampments, Growing Problems\nThere have been several fires at homeless encampments around Oakland. Acting Oakland Fire Chief Mark Hoffmann recalls at least four fires in the last month alone.\n“It’s a trend of the times,” he said. “The encampments are higher density, and they’ve been longer-lived camps. So you’ve got a lot more debris and junk built up.”\nA major fire burned several tents earlier this month at an encampment in West Oakland, which the city was previously using as a sanctioned site to deliver sanitation and housing counseling services. Another fire occurred early Wednesday morning under the BART tracks near the West Oakland stop.\nWhat the County and Cities Are Doing\nThere are several initiatives and programs that Alameda County and its cities are implementing or considering to help alleviate homelessness.\nAlameda County voters approved a $580 million housing bond in 2016 to help build thousands of affordable housing units, including supportive housing for the homeless. Voters in Berkeley and Oakland also approved bond measures that will help build affordable housing.\nAlameda County is also one of 18 pilots granted more than $140 million last year from the state to implement “Whole Person Care,” to address homeless people who need extra help. The county has launched a campaign to get more landlords to rent to low-income residents, de Coligny said. EveryOne Home is also seeking donations from the public to help the homeless transition into housing.\nHalf of Alameda County’s homeless population resides in Oakland. The City Council is currently considering which of the many homeless programs should be part of the next budget."},{"url":"http://www.wnyc.org/story/youre-not-imagining-it-your-allergies-really-are-worse-year","title":"You're Not Imagining It: Your Allergies Really Are Worse This Year","author_text":null,"keywords":["Npr","New York","Wnyc","Arts","Culture","News","Public","Radio"],"publication_text":"WNYC","description":"Spring is in the air, along with all those pesky allergens.

Players are usually immune while inside their homes or at school or work.\nOr while not wearing clothes.\nThat's where law enforcement has gotten involved.\nPolice have also expressed more serious concerns about safety, considering the teenagers' zeal for ambushing or fleeing each other.\n\"Some kids are playing while in their cars, causing traffic hazards and driving recklessly,\" said South Milwaukee Police Chief Ann Wellens.\nReports of the game being played in suburbs nationwide go back at least five years. Brookfield Police got involved when their local students were playing it in 2013.\nLast week, the South Milwaukee School District urged parents to talk to their children about playing the game safely and respectfully, noting that the otherwise socially engaging activity could also have a dangerous element.\n\"While students did play the game in the past, it wasn't until this year that we received (parent and staff) questions regarding it,\" South Milwaukee High School Principal Beth Kaminski said by email.\nHer earlier note was posted on May 16 to a Twitter feed of game updates, presumably run by a student.\nTwo days later on May 18, South Milwaukee police arrested two teenagers playing the game. A 17-year-old was cited for disorderly conduct, a $439 fine, and a 15-year-old was cited for lewd and lascivious behavior, a $565 fine, according to police.\nThat prompted an end to the South Milwaukee Paranoia game, according to the feed.\nBut the game appears to be going strong in other south side suburbs.\nA Twitter feed called @CudahyParanoia referred to players advancing to a championship round last week.

The length may set a record for the court system in the nation’s capital and is likely among the most protracted in the history of American jurisprudence.\nBryant, a 59-year-old who once worked in a typing pool for the District’s Department of Corrections, accused her former supervisor of denying her a promotion because she rebuffed his advances. In 1992, the director of the city’s now-defunct Department of Human Rights and Minority Business Development ruled in her favor.\nWhat followed was not vindication but a dispute over the precise amount of money Bryant is owed — now including almost three decades of interest — that still has no end in sight.\n“This scarecrow of a suit has, over the course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means,” Charles Dickens wrote of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the fictional lawsuit at the center of “Bleak House.” But the Jarndyce family had nothing on Bryant. Dickens said he took inspiration for his novel from a case that lasted a paltry 20 years.\nBryant’s case has been heard by nine judges and this week is scheduled to go before a 10th. Her attorney — Robert Adler, who has represented her since she walked into his downtown Washington office for their first appointment in 1990 — said her case is “undoubtedly” the oldest in the District and perhaps the country.\n“It does sound like — pardon my French — a s--- show. It is exceptional, it is extraordinary, in its length,” said J.H. “Rip” Verkerke, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. “Civil litigation will often take five or even 10 years to resolve, but anything stretching into two decades starts to qualify as a kind of legendary delay.”\nA spokesman for the D.C. Attorney General’s Office, which represents the city in the case, declined to comment because the case is pending.\nThe pleadings in Deborah Jean Bryant v. D.C. Department of Corrections, which over the years has migrated from typewriters to computers, outline a fight that has continued as the Soviet Union collapsed, five presidents entered or left the White House, and the prison where Bryant once typed up parole reports was transformed into a luxury apartment complex.\nThrough that time, Bryant — a soft-spoken and slightly acerbic grandmother of five — said she has persevered for a simple reason: She’s right.\n“I’m the type of person that if you’re wrong, I’ll tell you you’re wrong,” she said during a recent interview. “I’m still fighting because I was wronged.”\nBuilt in 1910, the Lorton Reformatory’s porticoed brick walls hid a ghoulish warren of cells that became notorious after the detention and torture of women’s suffrage activists in 1917.\nBut for Bryant — a Marine’s daughter with a degree from Quantico High School who went to work in a typing pool at the prison in the 1980s — it represented a secure future with a chance to rise through the ranks of District bureaucracy and retire with a comfortable pension.\nIn 1987, she became a secretary for John Lattimore, a senior prison administrator who liked to socialize with his employees. Bryant said she initially enjoyed attending concerts by the O’Jays and Marvin Gaye with groups of her co-workers, including her new boss, but their relationship soon took an uncomfortable turn.\nBryant later said in a sworn affidavit that Lattimore repeatedly asked her out, told her she had “a nice derrière” and remarked in front of another prison worker that “Deborah could have anything she wants if she does the right thing.”\nShe also testified that Lattimore repeatedly told her he was “in love” and said that she “should sit in his lap so that he could play Santa Claus,” according to case records.\nLattimore, now retired, declined to comment. “You can deal with the Department of Corrections. I ain’t got nothing to say,” he said, standing in the doorway of his home on a quiet street of shade trees and rolling front lawns in District Heights, Md.\nA department spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.\nBryant said she did not immediately complain because of pervasive sexism at the corrections department, which in the late 1990s settled a class-action lawsuit alleging widespread sexual harassment of female workers.\nShe said she was also worried that Lattimore could block her from better jobs.\n“All I cared about was getting my promotion,” she said.\nHer silence did little good.\nIn the fall of 1988, city investigators later found, Bryant was demoted to work as a typist in a cell block, where she was responsible for helping inmates write up their complaints.\nCommuting to work from the home she shared with her two daughters in Spotsylvania, Va., Bryant found herself in tears as she approached the prison in her old Mazda 626. “It just got to the point that I couldn’t function there no more,” she said.\nIn late 1989, she checked herself into the psychiatric ward at Mary Washington Hospital, where she was diagnosed with major depression. She would not return to work full time for two years.\nWhen Adler first met Bryant, he thought she had an open-and-shut case against the District’s government. At first, it seemed he might be right.\nDistrict human rights director Margie A. Utley found in September 1992 that Bryant had been denied advancement because of sexual discrimination and ordered corrections officials to promote her and pay her back wages for what should have been a better job.\nBut the corrections department appealed the decision, and for the next 11 years, Bryant and Adler battled the city over the merits of Utley’s ruling. Another nine years passed in a dispute over whether she was entitled to interest on her still-unpaid back wages from the 1980s and early 1990s.\nIn 2012, a D.C. Court of Appeals panel found that Bryant was entitled to the interest, stating that she had “endured a particularly long and procedurally complicated ordeal.”\nThe department then wrote her a check — for $100,480, $52,000 less than it previously said she was owed in back wages.\nCorrections officials said they had revisited their records and discovered that their earlier math had been wrong and had included pay for hours Bryant had not worked.\nIncluding interest, the total payment came to $150,000, some $50,000 of which went to Adler’s law firm. For the past five years, Bryant and Adler have been struggling to claim the final $52,000 they say she is owed, plus interest.\nA third of that would pay Adler’s fees.\nThe case is pending before a D.C. administrative law judge, with no indication that it is any closer to being resolved than it was 10 or 20 years ago.\nAdler, who was 47 when Bryant filed her complaint, is now a genteel, silver-haired 73-year-old.\nHe estimates that he has done $600,000 of work on her case, most of which he will never be paid.\nThe legal twilight that has engulfed his client for a quarter-century is largely a result of the snail’s pace at which the D.C. legal system proceeds, he said.\n“This is not a hard case. It’s really pretty easy,” said Adler, who works in the D.C. office of the law firm Nossaman LLP. “These people just don’t work that hard. That’s what the fact of the matter is.”\nJonathan Turley, a lawyer and professor at the George Washington University Law School, said the District’s courts have long been criticized for their slow pace.\nThe delays can be particularly severe in government workplace cases, such as Bryant’s, where a mix of administrative and Superior Court judges weigh in at different stages.\n“Each one of these case transfers has built into it months, even years, of delay,” he said. “A litigant can find themselves ping-ponging between the court and the administrative office.”\nTurley — who represented people who sued the District over mass arrests at a 2002 anti-World Bank demonstration, a case that took almost 14 years to resolve — said such delays work to the advantage of defendants, particularly governments, which have the time and resources to wear down plaintiffs by attrition.\n“Litigation is a lot like dying by exposure,” Turley said.\nBryant’s brother, Gary Graves, said she has not been immune to the effects of her long court ordeal and the bout of harassment that preceded it. “She’s not as outgoing as she used to be,” he said. “It took a big toll on her.”\nBut he said he does not fault her for refusing to walk away. “She feels she’s owed something,” he said.\nBryant, who was laid off after the federal government took over the District’s prisons in the late 1990s and closed down Lorton, now works as a security guard. She said she has no plans to relent: The additional money she is owed would help pay the mortgage on her three-bedroom home and put her closer to a secure retirement, she said.\nBut after watching generations of government lawyers dig in against her and Adler, she said she sometimes wonders whether the fight is one they can win.\n“It seems like they’re waiting for one of us to drop dead,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.citylab.com/design/2017/05/how-renzo-piano-builds-cities/527907","title":"How Renzo Piano Builds Cities","author_text":"Mark Byrnes","keywords":[],"publication_text":"CityLab","description":"The 79-year-old architect discusses how openness in architecture makes for safer, happier places.","date":"","full_text":"For Renzo Piano, every building should tell a story.\nThe 79-year-old architect is as busy as ever with a workload that spans from Los Angeles to Uganda. With no signs of fatigue in a nearly 50-year career, Piano doesn’t struggle to find meaning in each new project. “I’ve wanted to make buildings since I was a kid,” says the Italian-born architect, who fondly recalls spending time at construction sites with his dad.\nDespite making a name for himself after winning the competition, along with Richard Rogers, in 1971 to design the Centre Pompidou in Paris—a project that revolutionized the cultural role of the modern museum—Piano sees his work as a reflection of what’s happening in the world, not as a force of change. “I’ve been very lucky in my life,” he says. “When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, I got a call not much later asking me to do Potsdamer Platz. I didn’t create any change in Berlin, but I ended up there because something had happened and someone needed to express that change.”\nThe architect’s work has rarely drawn outrage since the Pompidou and its playful, machine-like appearance shocked traditionalists and fussy Parisians in the ‘70s. (It faced six lawsuits before opening.) But he is mindful of the offense that projects like the Pompidou, or the Shard—London’s tallest skyscraper—can trigger. “Buildings are multidimensional, just as the cities they’re built in,” says Piano. “If a building tells a story at all, that story will keep shifting.”\nIn New York, Piano is behind the masterplan for Columbia University’s Manhattanville campus, slated for completion by 2030. His own buildings for the campus have been praised for their structural elegance and openness to the surroundings. The first phase of the campus is now open after years of litigation over Columbia’s contested use of eminent domain and a severely tested relationship between the university and the neighborhood.\nPiano, whose book of complete works has been recently updated and re-released (Renzo Piano: The Complete Logbook 1966-2016, Thames and Hudson), spoke with CityLab earlier this spring from his New York office in a room facing the new Whitney Museum of American Art, which he designed. Our conversation touched on a variety of topics including Manhattanville, urban peripheries, and the importance of designing buildings that reject paranoia in a world increasingly concerned with terrorism.\nFirst of all, tell us about your Manhattanville plans for Columbia.\nIn 2002, Lee Bollinger, the president of Columbia, came to me and said, “We need to think about how we can make an urban campus in the new century.” He wanted a truly urban approach near the Morningside campus. So, Manhattanville is where we built it, which is only a few subway stops away.\nManhattanville is a crowded, bustling place. I do a lot of work on the periphery of urban cores. I love the possibilities that come with these kinds of areas and that’s what I’ve been able to get into with this new campus.\nMorningside campus looks nothing like [the Manhattanville campus]. That was built in the middle of the 19th century, when you would build a gate and then a fake historic campus inside it to create a sense of dignity. I get that, but it’s time for something different. To build a campus in the 21st century, you need to build a system underground that connects everything (technology, energy, etc.), and which allows the street level to be extremely open and the research and academics to be hosted above that. You’re keeping the campus open and taking away the gate so that students aren’t growing in some sort of paradise. Manhattanville is a busy, diverse space and this campus is tapping into its energies and desires.\nManhattanville has a historic former milk pasteurization factory, an old Studebaker factory, and Riverside Drive, which is just a masterpiece of simplicity. So we looked at all of this and asked ourselves, “Do you really needed to take the lessons from Old Europe? Or can we say that today’s culture—American culture—is perfectly trustworthy?” I don’t think you don’t need to do something that looks old to be trusted.\n“Today’s culture—American culture—is perfectly trustworthy.”\nWe’re expressing something about clarity, accessibility, openness, and a sense of lightness with this campus. It has an invigorating sense of unity and belonging without pretending to be Gothic. There are plenty of fantastic universities in this country made to look old and another one like that might be fine, but a truly urban campus today has to be an example of integration between different disciplines. You can observe the chemical structure of the brain, study the earth’s ecosystem, experience the beauty and emotion of art all in the same campus here.\nAnyone can come in and enjoy it. There’s a fantastic piazza, which is intended as a community space—there’s no gate. The architectural functions of the campus, of science and art, are placed around the square. There’s an exchange of ideas and by people studying global issues. It’s not the biggest campus, but it’s a new kind of campus and a fantastic combination of uses and spaces with a great spirit of beauty, access, and sharing.\nFrom the street level, your buildings on this campus seem to be speaking a similar design language as the Whitney.\nWell, the Whitney is about American art and the neighborhood around it. It’s also about creating something people love that didn’t exist before. There’s a sense of the traditional piazza and a connection with the street level, which didn’t exist at the Madison Avenue location. Breuer’s building is beautiful but logistically impossible to work with. Here, with the new building, on one side you have Chelsea—a special part of the city—and on the other side you have the Hudson River with the sunset. It’s magical! So it’s different and the function is different.\nThere are few professions in the world that allow you to make something beautiful, and architecture is certainly one of them. Unless you’re stupid, you should have a story to tell when you’re starting on a new project or an invention. You’re accessing your own storage of experiences and creating new forms out of repetition. Each new project is going to tell a different story, but you need to recognize that there’s room for continuity. This can come down to things that have very little to do with the form and more to do with an emotion that you connect to through openness, transparency, lightness. With these two projects, they aren’t light buildings, they’re quite bulky in some ways, but I do think they have a sense of lightness anyways.\n“If there’s nothing to say, then there’s nothing to build!”\nWhatever continuity you see in my work is not ‘a style.’ For me, style is something that sticks ideas in a cage. It’s more interesting to try to understand from each building what is being expressed in its function and the way people are using it. There’s introspection in the work, an attitude.\nThe Guggenheim Bilbao is typically seen as the origin of today’s wave of museum architecture, but we can easily trace it back to the Pompidou. What’s changed about people’s expectations of museums since then?\nPompidou was the first. Museums at the time were for the elite. I certainly didn’t want to become an aristocrat just to go to a museum! Our design was not just about culture: it was about freedom.\nI shouldn’t understate the importance of the Pompidou’s architecture, but the truth is that when Richard Rogers and I designed it we were very young, in our 30s. You needed young people to do a project like that. It wasn’t that we were changing the world of art. Art was changing because the world was changing. It was only a couple of years after May ’68 so it was a different moment and someone had to do the dirty job of expressing that. It was one thing to pick up on that shift but something else to actually turn that into a building. It was like making a photo or a poem of a moment: Something’s happening and you just happen to be there. The shift was inevitable.\nMuseums have changed so much since then, probably the most of any major building type. Office buildings haven’t really changed much but museums do completely different things now. There are greater expectations regarding programming and education, but also how they interact with their surroundings.\nDo you notice a general shift in the values or expectations of museum clients from 20, 30 years ago?\nYes, I do. Within the first few minutes of meeting a client, you understand what the element—the new thing—is. If there’s no new thing, then you’re in trouble!\nWe draw everything in my office, all the nuts and bolts, so we try not to take on more than what we can handle. Sometimes a client will ask us to do a museum but you figure out pretty quickly they’re asking you because they’re expecting a special shine, your own special brand. I’m not blaming anybody for that but it’s like, ‘where’s the story here?’ If there’s nothing to say, then there’s nothing to build! A good project will take the invisible part of the client’s idea and make it visible. If you don’t have that, you have an impossible project.\nIn New York with the Times building right after 9/11, or with the Istanbul Modern today, how much do clients push back on your ideas because of security concerns?\nI’m dealing with that right now in Istanbul, certainly. Going back to The New York Times, security was a big issue but we agreed that it would be mad to build a bunker. Our building was about transparency and openness because, as far as I’m concerned, it’s safer. I’d say our designs became even more about transparency after 9/11. With the Times building, you can enter it easily right on the street. Same for its restaurants and stores. This idea of openness as an antidote to terrorism is part of the building’s story.\nSecurity is something that matters for projects we’re doing all around the world now. My office in Paris isn’t far from where the November attacks took place, so we’re aware of the paranoia that can take hold after something like that. But we will always be resistant to the idea of making bunkers. This is why it’s so important to pay attention to the way streets and buildings function together. It’s the starting point for understanding how an entire city functions.\nI believe that humanity gravitates towards cities while monsters grow in darkness and isolation. You have to combine città e civiltà [“cities and civilization”], cities where you can create and experience a miraculous mix of places and scenes with every type of possibility for every type of person. I want to build every kind of building!\nWell, except for a few kinds, which I’ll never do.\nLike what?\nI can’t tell you! But you can imagine.\nThis is related to my interest in urban peripheries. Architecture can fertilize these areas, cross-pollinate if you will. You need that. That’s why the House of Justice project we’re doing in the northern banlieue of Paris is important to me. It’s a tall and ambitious building on the edge of a very rough part of Paris. With the development happening there now (including our project), these are only drops in a bucket—but they’re big drops. Eventually, you will have helped create a better place.\nYour projects seem to be pretty sensitive to the sites they inherit. The Shard faced quite a backlash, mostly because of its height. How did you approach that site, and are you surprised by how many people dislike it?\nI wasn’t too surprised. If you’re an architect in the right place and time, you don’t change the world but you do get to build something that reflects the changes that are happening.\nThe Shard didn’t come up from sketches as much as it came out of the mind of then-mayor Ken Livingstone. He wanted to make a more vertical city and to use the site for something that wouldn’t empty out by 6 p.m. At the Shard, everyone can arrive by public transit. It only has 48 parking spaces all together. Railways are there, Tube lines, bus lines, so I just needed to design a tall building to put in office, restaurant, hotel, and some commercial space—just some commercial, not a shopping mall—and so I ended up with a building that is quite fat at the bottom and could have been even taller. If you look at how it changes as it moves up, the crown at the top isn’t a lazy gesture—as the tower gets narrower it still looks like it could keep ascending another 100 meters. And, of course, just being along the Thames, it makes quite a statement to the other side of the city.\n“You don’t make a building different for the sake of being different. That would be stupid.”\nWhen it was finished I heard people say it was great, fantastic, beautiful. I was in London the other day and I saw it unexpectedly. It was like seeing your wife or your fiancée in a new light and you’re just in awe of how beautiful she is! But for some, they say, ‘Oh my god! You’re a tyrant! You’re destroying the city!’ This was exactly what happened with Pompidou! People were acting like I had ruined Paris forever.\nI don’t necessarily enjoy that. You don’t make a building different for the sake of being different. That would be stupid. If someone like Ken Livingstone comes to you and says, “I want to create a denser, livelier city. Can you help me?” You sit down and say, “Why not?” I want to make buildings that have life 24 hours a day. I hate new buildings that act like a mysterious neighbor—closed off and antisocial.\nSo, some people look at the Shard and say, “Wow, that’s fantastic!” In fact, I think many people do. Others—not to my face yet—say, “What is that?” The truth is that buildings need time—a long time—to tell their story."},{"url":"https://theconversation.com/in-british-columbia-a-strange-pattern-in-humpback-whale-behaviour-raises-the-stakes-for-conservation-77078","title":"In British Columbia, a strange pattern in humpback whale behaviour raises the stakes for conservation","author_text":"Eric Keen","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Conversation","description":"A new study shows that the way humpback whales choose their habitats is affected by humans.","date":"","full_text":"In a fjord system of northern British Columbia, Canada’s westernmost province, a team of scientists, non-profits and an indigenous monitoring group have uncovered a curious humpback whale behaviour. Dubbed the “whale wave”, it suggests local displacement of the animals caused by humans may have more consequences than previously thought.\nBy “wave”, researchers mean a seasonal shift in the habitats used by humpbacks. In the early summer, the whales concentrate in the outer channels of the fjord system nearest the open ocean. And, as the summer turns to autumn, they propagate further into the fjord system and deeper into the mainland.\nMore than ten years of whale surveys indicate that this complex pattern occurs at roughly the same time every year.\nA wave that had gone undetected\nThough annually persistent and remarkably specific in structure, the whale wave is not the kind of pattern that is picked up in typical marine mammal surveys. That’s because such surveys usually spread their precious time over a broad area.\nIn fact, the wave had gone undetected by several research groups in recent years, and it was only revealed thanks to more than a decade of annual local monitoring by the Gitga’at First Nation’s Guardian Team and their partners, the North Coast Cetacean Society (NCCS).\nThe thousands of survey hours these two groups logged in all months of the year allowed them to detect this curious pattern. And their deep familiarity with the study area, born naturally from living in it year-round, allowed them to interpret it and work with scientists from Scripps Institution of Oceanography and NOAA-NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center to develop a new study to understand drivers of the wave.\nThe wave’s discovery was recently published in a top-tier marine ecology journal. It included the work I conducted with a small team of students to better understand the drivers of this strange humpback behaviour.\nWe worked with the Gitga’at and NCCS to develop a hypothesis-driven ecosystem study of fjord habitat and the ways humpbacks are using it. Mirroring the patient watchful approach of the Gitga’at and NCCS, we lived and studied from a research sailboat for the 2015 feeding season, from May through September.\nIncreased large ship traffic\nIt all happened in the Douglas Channel fjord system, a beautiful and remote network of steep-walled corridors once known for its remote beauty and mysterious “spirit” bears (white morphs of the black bear).\nToday, Douglas Channel is better known for the slew of oil and natural gas tanker routes proposed for its winding waterways. Of the proposed tanker projects, the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline was most contentious due to its crude bitumen cargo and associated risk of disastrous spills.\nBut from a whale’s perspective, the spills are not the only concern. Fatal ship strikes, injury or starvation due to entanglement in debris, and disorientation and disturbance due to ship noise are some of the most probable of many potential consequences of increased large ship traffic within these confined waters.\nSince the Northern Gateway was finally shut down last northern autumn after the Gitga’at and other coastal First Nations won a prolonged legal battle, attention has shifted to the several liquified natural gas (LNG) pipeline and tanker proposals slated for the port of Kitimat at the head of Douglas Channel.\nThe proposed tanker routes divide the Douglas Channel fjord system fairly neatly in two. Every summer, the whale wave passes up from the fjord’s outer channels to its innermost waters, overlapping with different portions of the proposed tanker routes as it goes.\nA critical habitat\nThe humpback whale, loved worldwide for its complex song, picturesque flukes and fantastic aerial behaviours, is the most abundant baleen whale in British Columbia waters.\nThe Douglas Channel area has been proposed as a “critical habitat” for the feeding opportunities it provides British Columbia’s humpback whales. Several hundred individuals are considered “resident” to its confined waters. And this number is growing every year according to Janie Wray, lead researcher for the North Coast Cetacean Society, who has been studying the whales since 2003.\nHumpback whales are not the only cetaceans to rely upon the Douglas Channel fjord system. The area was proposed as critical habitat for Northern Resident and Bigg’s (transient) killer whales, and is being evaluated as a potential critical habitat for fin whales, the second-largest species in earth’s history.\nSpecific behaviours\nSome results of our study were unexpected. We were surprised to find, for instance, that the monthly distribution of prey was a poor predictor of the whale wave.\n“Our findings suggest humpback foraging needs within this fjord system are balanced against needs other than food and that the balance shifts through the year,” noted Janie Wray of NCCS.\nOther factors that may be in play include physical and social habitat needs such as the water’s depth and the acoustic properties of the fjords for communication and singing. And companionship for the purpose of travelling within a group or mating.\nOur findings suggest that this wave likely results from humpbacks familiarising themselves with this critical habitat over many years and developing specific behaviours coordinated to the specific oceanography of the fjord system that enable them to make the greatest use of its resources.\nWe realised that this meant local displacement of whales by human impacts may have more consequences than previously supposed. We can’t expect these whales to simply pick up and go somewhere else if industrial activities, such as shipping lanes, disrupt continuity of critical habitats, such as the Douglas Channel fjord system.\nUntil thorough habitat-use studies are completed, irrevocable management decisions should be treated with caution.\nWhales and their habitat\n“This study shows just how intricate the relationship between humpback whales and their habitat is, and it raises important questions about their conservation,” said Arnold Clifton, chief councilor and hereditary chief of the Gitga’at First Nation. “In light of the industrial pressures facing our territory, our Nation’s reliance on the sea and the sensitivity and complexity of the area’s ecology, our leadership’s commitment to conservation and long-term local monitoring by our Gitga’at Guardians has never been more important or stronger.”\nThe whale wave is a perfect example of the conservation value of small, long-term research partnerships of neighbours, which is a model that the Save Our Seas Foundation, a supporter of NCCS, has applied to protecting ocean species worldwide.\nIn the cetology classic Among Whales, Roger Payne wrote that “[A]ny observant local knows more than any visiting scientist. Always. No exceptions.”\nWhat other intricate patterns in the sea could be going unnoticed by visiting scientists on their chartered vessels? Perhaps there are some discoveries that reveal themselves only to those who are residents first, and scientists second."},{"url":"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/lester-carey-hand-lettered-signs-new-orleans","title":"Remembering the Artist Behind New Orleans’ Hand-Lettered Signs","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Lester Carey contributed to the unique feel of the city's streets.","date":"","full_text":"Outside of a residential building on North Miro Street in New Orleans’ Treme neighborhood, there is a thin, white pole about six feet high. At the top of the pole is the frame for a two-part sign; the upper piece is completely missing, but the bottom remains. Hand painted in a muted blue, a mix of block lettering and script spell out simply: “Over 42-Years Experience.”\nOutlasting any identifying information about the business, and it would appear, the business itself, this is the work of Lester Carey.\nOne of a handful of New Orleans’ hand-painted sign makers, Carey’s work appears on the sides of corner stores, bars, auto repair shops, funeral homes, barbershops and churches across the city. His vernacular style is at once distinctive and anonymous — an aesthetic most locals would recognize, but take for granted, and be unlikely to attribute to an individual artist, let alone Carey. Carey died earlier this month at the age of 64. He struggled with homelessness and drinking.\nDespite his citywide presence, Lester Carey was a neighborhood man. He was known well in New Orleans’ Central City area, where he spent his days posted up on corners with friends and walking the streets with his shopping cart full of art supplies. He could usually be found hanging with his buggy on Felicity street, out front of a tire shop that boasted many of his own signs, advertising the shop’s business hours and instructing customers not to block the driveway.\nHand painted signs are prevalent throughout New Orleans as a cheap and lasting way for businesses to advertise. But beyond the practical considerations of finances and durability, most shop owners I talked to said, it’s just what they’ve always done. Carey would make regular rounds, visiting spots where his work was showing wear to make cosmetic updates, or offering to paint new menus on the sides of corner stores. For $10 or $15 bucks a pop, no one was going to tell him no, even in an age of cheap printed and digital signage.\nWilbert Chambliss Jr., a barber whose shop sits on Felicity Street across from the tire shop, said Carey would come by every six months or so to touch up his window display, originally commissioned by Chambliss’ father in 2000. The shop and the sign made it through Hurricane Katrina without much damage. Chambliss says he recognizes hand painting as something of a dying art.\n“In this day and time, if this (shop) was just being started up, I doubt we’d have a window like that,” he concedes. But he says, he never thought about getting a vinyl or light-up sign. He prefers a custom design, like Carey’s. “If you walk around the neighborhood, each and everyone one of his signs are unique and different. That’s the way he did it; he did it to please the customer.”\nOne such customer is Billy Kattoum, who runs the Magnolia Market, just blocks from the barber shop.\nKattoum has been in charge there for 20 years, and says his predecessor worked with Carey before him. Carey used to paint the weekly meat board specials on the side of the market, updating the prices every time they would change on specialty items like turkey necks and pig feet. Kattoum said he didn’t think much of it; Lester always came around looking for work, and he gave it to him. “It was never about the money for him,” Kattoum said. “He was just living day by day.”\nNot everyone took Carey’s signature style at face value. Anthony DelRosario is a librarian at Tulane University. After Katrina hit, he switched up his route to work, and found himself biking through Central City. He appreciated the hand-painting on the sides of corner stores and bars, and began to notice a consistent and idiosyncratic style among much of the signage: a playful yet commanding blend of script and block lettering, sometimes with a spirited curved word, unevenly sized fonts and sometimes a poor use of available space. The signs were often accompanied by images of food: cartoonish hamburgers or po’boys whose fillings were represented as triangles. DelRosario began taking photos to document the signs, many of which were on abandoned stores he feared could be demolished.\n“The city seemed like it was going to change quite a bit post Katrina,” DelRosario remembers, “so it seemed like it was important to document what made New Orleans, New Orleans.”\nGallery: Lester Carey Lettering\nOne of Carey's signs appears on the corner of Miro and Barracks in the Treme. Even after a paint job, the number of years represented remains the same and the business it is referencing remains a mystery. (Photo by Nina Feldman)\nAfter taking photographs for some time, DelRosario wanted to find the artist behind the work. One image, painted on an old wall of one of public housing complexes that would eventually be demolished and redeveloped, included a signature. And so began DelRosario’s quest for Lester Carey.\nOnce he tracked him down (on Felicity Street in Central City), DelRosario spent the next nine years supporting Carey and working to bring him the recognition he felt he deserved. He took hundreds of photos of Carey’s work and created extensive social media accounts to document it. Carey got his degree in commercial art at Delgado Community college, and Delrosario describes Carey’s style as “naive commercial art,” or a sort of commercial folk art.\n“It’s maybe a little laissez-faire,” DelRosario said of Carey’s style. “The lettering’s not perfect.”\nIn a city that is constantly seeking ephemera and traditions, DelRosario had picked out an aesthetic unique to New Orleans that it seems even a city so self-aware had failed to notice. DelRosario started making pins and shirts with Lester’s designs on them and selling them online, under the name Nola ‘Nacular, with proceeds going back to Carey. Soon, Jac Currie, of clothing company Defend New Orleans, took notice. Defend New Orleans uses iconic symbols and phrases from the Crescent City to create a city brand appreciated by locals and tourists alike, and Currie partnered with DelRosario to make a t-shirt displaying Carey’s signature script and block blend. Currie, who at the time also owned neighborhood haunt and late night dance bar, The Saint, recognized Carey’s work as both innovative and essentially New Orleanian. He even commissioned Carey to paint a sign on the exterior wall of the bar.\nI’ve lived walking distance from the “Over 42-years Experience” sign on Miro Street for almost seven years, and I’ve pondered it often. Last year, I noticed the sign had gotten a fresh paint job. Whoever felt it was important to give the sign a facelift wasn’t as concerned about illuminating the subject of its pride or updating its timetable. Today, seven years later, it reads the same.\nIn some ways, the tradition of hand painted signs like this one could be characterized the same way one might describe the entire New Orleans ethos: It might not be the most practical solution, but we’ve always done it this way; it is unlike anything else, and it’s beautiful.​\nLester Carey did not have life insurance. Anthony DelRosario created a gofundme page to assist Carey’s sisters with the funeral costs. Any funds raised over the goal will go towards establishing an arts scholarship in Carey’s name.\nNina Feldman is an independent journalist focused on audio production, based in New Orleans.

(AP) — Head in hands, his voice strained, Vincent Mitchell sat outside his little yellow home and tried to make sense of how a family dispute led to a rampage that killed eight people, including the deputy who tried to keep them safe.\n\"I'm devastated. It don't seem like it's real,\" Mitchell said shortly after the arrest of his stepson-in-law, Willie Corey Godbolt. \"Him and my stepdaughter, they've been going back and forth for a couple of years with that domestic violence.\"\nGodbolt showed up at Mitchell's home in the southern Mississippi town of Bogue Chitto shortly before midnight Saturday to demand that his estranged wife give up their two children. She and the kids had been staying with them for about three weeks, Mitchell told The Associated Press.\n\"He'd come to get his kids. The deputy was called,\" and asked him to leave, and it seemed like Godbolt would comply at first, Mitchell said.\n\"He acted like, motioned like, he was fixing to go. Then he reached in his back pocket and grabbed a gun,\" Mitchell said. \"He just started shooting everything.\"\nMitchell said he escaped along with Godbolt's wife, but Mitchell's wife, her sister and one of the wife's daughters were killed. Also slain was Deputy William Durr, a two-year sheriff's department veteran and former police officer in nearby Brookhaven, where authorities said Godbolt fled and killed four more people at two other homes.\nAuthorities on Monday said Godbolt was related to or acquainted with all the victims except Durr. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation identified them as: Barbara Mitchell, 55; Brenda May, 53; Tocarra May, 35; a child who was not identified; a 17-year-old boy who was not identified; Ferral Burage, 45; and Shelia Burage, 46.\nPolice have not said exactly how Godbolt knew them. A member of Godbolt's church previously told the AP that everyone but the deputy was related to Godbolt by blood or marriage.\nMississippi Bureau of Investigation spokesman Warren Strain said prosecutors plan to charge Godbolt, 35, with one count of capital murder and seven counts of first degree murder, but authorities haven't discussed a motive. Strain said those charges could change as the investigation continues.\nGodbolt was still hospitalized Monday at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. Police have said Godbolt is being treated for a gunshot wound.\nGodbolt himself shed some light on what happened, in an interview he gave to The Clarion-Ledger as he sat with his hands cuffed behind his back on the side of a road in Brookhaven, about 70 miles south of Jackson.\n\"I was having a conversation with her stepdaddy and her mama and her, my wife, about me taking my children home,\" he said. \"Somebody called the officer, people that didn't even live at the house. That's what they do. They intervene.\"\n\"They cost him his life,\" he said, apparently referring to Durr. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\"My pain wasn't designed for him. He was just there,\" Godbolt said. \"I ain't fit to live, not after what I done.\"\nGodbolt was hospitalized in good condition with a gunshot wound, though it wasn't clear who shot him.\n\"Everybody that got killed was related to him, except the deputy,\" said Johnny Hall Sr., a longtime member of the New Zion Union M.B. Church in Bogue Chitto, not far from the initial crime scene, where he said Godbolt also was a member.\nAt least seven hours elapsed between the first shootings and Godbolt's arrest near the final crime scene, in a subdivision of ranch houses.\n\"It breaks everybody's heart,\" said Garrett Smith, a 19-year-old college student who went to high school with one of the victims. \"Everybody knows everybody for the most part.\"\nDurr, 36, was married and had an 11-year-old son, Lincoln County Sheriff Steve Rushing said.\nDurr's mother spoke briefly with the AP on Monday, saying that the family is still in distress.\n\"He was a good Christian man,\" Debbie Durr said at her rural home near Brookhaven. \"He was a youth minister and a pastor before going into law enforcement.\"\nOff duty, Durr also was a ventriloquist who took his puppets to schools and churches. Two weeks ago, Durr entertained preschoolers at Brookhaven Academy, a Christian school in town. The message he shared was that — like fireflies — people can use their inner light to help those around them.\n\"His character: top-notch,\" said Page Nelson, the school's elementary principal.\nGodbolt had a different message — he said he hadn't planned to be captured alive.\n\"My intentions was to have God kill me.

During a recent meeting with parents and teachers at the White House, Trump said he wants “every single disadvantaged child in America, no matter what their background or where they live, to have a choice about where they go to school.”\nBut the federal tax credit proposal already has critics on the left and right. Public school advocates say such a tax credit is a voucher program in disguise and would divert tax dollars from struggling public schools.\n“The end result is the same — federal tax dollars going to private schools,” said Sasha Pudelski, assistant director for policy and advocacy at AASA, The School Superintendents Association, who called the program “a backdoor voucher.”\n“It’s just done through a more complex and less direct mechanism,” she said.\nWhile a tax credit may be more politically palatable than asking Congress to find or reallocate money to fulfill Trump’s $20 billion promise to expand charter and private school options, “just because it’s more palatable, doesn’t mean it tastes good,” said Noelle Ellerson Ng, the group’s associate executive director.\nCritics on the right, meanwhile, worry such a plan would increase the federal role in education and pressure states to standardize state tax credit programs, many of which now allow nonprofit groups to prioritize a particular type of school, such as those of particular religious denominations, for instance.\nA federal tax credit scholarship program could be part of a larger tax reform bill and pass through the budget reconciliation process with only 51 votes in the Senate. Delays in repealing Obamacare, however, are complicating Republican plans to push tax reform through Congress.\nThe White House did not respond to questions on the tax credit proposal or its status by deadline. Details of how the Trump administration might structure the plan remain unknown. But sources close to the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly say the program might be capped at a level as high as $20 billion, and resemble legislation first introduced by Republicans Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rep. Todd Rokita of Indiana in 2013, called the Educational Opportunities Act.\nThat bill, which has never passed either chamber, would have created a federal tax credit of up to $4,500 for individuals and up to $100,000 for corporations that make donations to nonprofit “scholarship-granting organizations,” or SGOs. Those organizations would award the funds to low-income students, who could use the money to attend private schools, including those run by religious groups.\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos praised the bill in 2015 when it was reintroduced and she was chair of the school choice advocacy group, American Federation for Children.\n“There’s no single domestic issue more pressing than fixing our nation’s antiquated education system and the Educational Opportunities Act will empower parents throughout the country to have access to quality educational options that are otherwise out of reach,” she said.\nRobert Goad, Trump’s education policy person on the White House Domestic Policy Council, is a former aide to Republican Rep. Luke Messer, who co-sponsored the bill and former executive director of advocacy group, School Choice Indiana.\nGoad said earlier this month he’s “not able to discuss policy matters yet.”\nSeventeen states have similar tax credit scholarship programs and a few others, like Kentucky and Texas, are considering bills this year.\nIt’s unclear whether a federal program would limit tax credits to residents and donors in states that already have their own tax credit programs with an infrastructure to support those. If that’s the case, it could incentivize states without such programs to create them.\nDeVos has pointed to Florida’s tax credit scholarship program as one of her biggest successes. Before being named to Trump’s Cabinet, DeVos was on the board of the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a reform group founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Together, they pushed for the creation and expansion of tax credit scholarship programs across the country.\nThe nonprofit Step Up for Students, which helps administer Florida’s program, says it has served more than 97,000 students. The scholarships, for low and middle-income students, are worth nearly $6,000 each. Nearly 70 percent of student recipients are black or Hispanic and more than 1,700 private schools participate in the program.\nMore than 80 percent of students use the scholarships to attend religious schools, with most coming from large, urban districts, a recent state report shows. About a quarter of the participating students are from Miami-Dade County public schools, the fourth-largest school district in the country.\n“A well-designed federal program could, for the first time, empower low-income parents in blue states — and red states who have been reluctant — to choose a better school for their children,” said John Kirtley, founder of Step Up For Students. Kirtley is also vice chairman of American Federation for Children. “In states with legislatures dominated by the teachers unions, it may be the only chance they ever have to be empowered.”\nFlorida’s program, however, has been beset by legal challenges. And groups representing the nation’s traditional public schools say they would fight any proposals to introduce such plans on the federal level.\nThe National Coalition for Public Education argues that private schools accepting tuition funded through tax credits aren’t held accountable like public schools, the advocacy group notes. And states have had to take action to make up for a decline in revenue. Alabama once put aside $40 million in its budget to absorb the anticipated loss from the tax credits, Stateline reported.\nVic Smith of the Indiana Coalition for Public Education said Indiana’s tax credit scholarship program, which passed in 2009, was the “gateway drug to [a state legislation authorizing] vouchers,” which passed in 2011. Indiana has lost millions in tax revenues due to the state tax credit scholarship alone, the Chicago-based Center for Budget and Tax Accountability has reported. Teachers unions and public education advocacy groups in Texas are actively fighting a state tax credit proposal there.\n“Vouchers in any form divert tax money to private schools or homeschoolers and take it from under-funded public schools, where the vast majority of school children will continue to be educated,” said Clay Robison, a spokesman for the Texas State Teachers Association. “When I say underfunded public schools, I am talking specifically about Texas, which spends about $2,700 less per child on education each year than the national average.”\nWhile promoting school choice has gained political momentum, not all conservatives think a federal tax credit is the right way to go — largely because they don’t want to see a larger federal hand in education.\n“I have reservations,” said Lindsey Burke, who leads the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy. “School choice is already moving along swimmingly in the states … We don’t want to over-convolute the tax code and there’s concern that this could get overregulated.”\nJason Bedrick, director of policy for the Indiana-based advocacy group EdChoice, worries that states and scholarship-granting organizations might feel pressure to conform to the provisions of a federal tax credit program.\nFor example, Bedrick said, the bill proposed by Rubio and Rokita would have given federal tax credits only for donations to scholarship-granting organizations that don’t “earmark or set aside contributions for scholarships on behalf of any particular student, or to any specific school or group of schools.” Essentially, donors would receive a federal tax credit only if they give to SGOs that award funds to all students looking to attend all types of schools.\nA provision like that could “exclude a broad and diverse array of SGOs that currently participate in scholarship tax credit programs nationwide,” Bedrick said. That’s because most states allow these organizations to be “mission-based,” working with schools of a particular religious denomination or educational philosophy like Montessori schools, he said.\n“It would be a mistake for conservatives to say, ‘now that we have control over the federal government, we’re going to push our ideas on a national scale,’” he added. “There’s going to be a lot more opposition than they think.”"},{"url":"https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-innovative-financing-methods-driving-better-health-care-for-all-90083","title":"Opinion: Innovative financing methods driving better health care for all","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Devex","description":"Universal health coverage was adopted as one of the targets under Sustainable Development Goal 3, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

UHC includes access to quality, essential health care services, and to safe, effective and affordable medicines and vaccines, as well as protection against financial risk.\nBut in the drive to improve people’s lives and to extend access to care, how can we best ensure that progress towards UHC — and a sustainable and inclusive model of health care — is structural, not merely incidental or sporadic?\n\"Accelerating the growing international movement for universal health coverage will be my number-one priority.\"\n— Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization\nStrengthening primary health care, with outreach into the community and a well-functioning referral chain, is the most efficient and effective way to improve access to good-quality health care, thereby paving the way for UHC.\nHowever, this requires a number of significant changes. First, primary health care systems need to be redesigned, based on community needs, to include services ranging from prevention to emergency care. This would ensure the systems are fit-for-purpose in tackling today’s and tomorrow’s disease burden, especially with the rise of noncommunicable diseases. Secondly, health care systems need to harness the full potential of technology, in particular digital technology, to improve the quality and efficiency of care.\nAt the same time, hybrid public-private health care models or other forms of partnership with the private sector should be considered. Governments need to decide on their role in delivering primary health care. Some governments may decide to let market actors provide care and take on a stewardship role, paying for results — either directly or through a public health insurance system — and assuring care providers meet national quality standards. Others may maintain strong ownership of service delivery, but will need to partner with the private sector to transform primary care through the effective application of innovations.\nResults-based financing\nIn pursuit of the SDGs, financing schemes need to change from input-based to results-based in order to provide incentives to improve health outcomes and efficiency of service delivery. There are several types of results-based financing models:\n1. Output-based models, where payment is linked to the volume of services provided.\nThe key to this transformation — and to the realization of the health care-related SDGs — is the pressing need for innovative financing and business models. For example, public-private partnerships that combine government funding with private income flows could facilitate new, sustainable business models that drive better health care for all.\nHybrid financing: The way ahead for health care\nThe way things are just now, something has to change. At present, donor funding alone is not sufficient to achieve the SDGs, especially with Western countries reducing their development cooperation budgets. Private investors, in particular impact investors, are interested in closing this funding gap, provided they can combine impact with financial return on investment. They are hesitant to invest in projects that are solely dependent on government payments, due to the poor track record of governments in target countries — e.g. developing economies — in meeting their long-term payment obligations.\nWe believe that a new, hybrid business model bringing together donors and impact investors, governments and the private sector has the potential to deliver on the SDGs. Certainly, private companies are willing to invest in innovations towards the SDGs, providing that reasonable returns can be achieved.\nAn example of a hybrid model would be where basic services paid for by government are combined with additional services paid for by patients, preferably through health insurance. Such hybrid business models can be deployed in PPPs, where the management capabilities, efficiency and innovation power of the private sector are applied to improve government service delivery.\nPartnering for the long term\nWith our mission to improve people’s lives through meaningful innovation, at Philips we are committed to long-term partnerships with governments and other stakeholders to strengthen their (primary) health care systems. As a promoter of the World Economic Forum Primary Healthcare Coalition and the Kenya SDG Partnership Platform, we are investing in technology and business model innovation in support of UHC.\nFor example, through our Community Life Centers — an open platform aimed at strengthening primary health care and turning the local health facility into a community hub, where technology is bundled with an integrated service package. The success of the first pilots in Kenya and Democratic Republic of the Congo gives us confidence that such platforms, implemented in collaboration with governmental and civil society partners, can be replicated at scale and so improve access to quality care for all.\nAnother essential change is that donors should allow the private sector to compete for their funding based on maximum impact per dollar spent. Currently, most donors allow private companies to participate in competitive bidding processes, but often do not allow profit-making, and sometimes even require a financial contribution, thus rendering the contract loss-making. These types of models are not sufficiently scalable.\nA commitment to long-term partnerships with governments and other stakeholders is vital in order to strengthen health care systems. It is by working together — and pursuing financing models where results on health care and service delivery are defined at population level — that we can scale the impact on people’s lives.\nWhat kinds of innovative financing models do you believe are most likely to help in the pursuit of the SDGs? Have your say by leaving a comment below.\nOver 10 weeks Devex, along with our partners the European Investment Bank, the International Finance Corporation, Philips, and the United Nations Development Programme, will take an in-depth look at the innovative financing mechanisms driving forward the 2030 sustainable development agenda.

The evidence has overwhelmed me. I take it back.\n“Stop saying ‘College isn’t for everyone,’” is one of my favorite retorts to the oft-aired argument, “Some people don’t belong in college.” It’s really a euphemism for, “Those people aren’t smart enough for college,” and is usually heard anywhere black and brown people live. But now I realize I have to rethink it, or at the very least use it in proper context. A wave of white nationalist activity on campus makes clear there are some people whom higher education shouldn’t make room for. For in making room for them, everyone suffers.\nBetween the election and the beginning of May, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that monitors hate groups, recorded more than 150 new reports of white nationalist fliers and recruitment materials on college campuses. But many colleges choose to downplay the spike in white supremacist activity on campus when they see it through the lens of academic freedom and free speech: It may be hateful, but it is acceptable. For many faculty members and administrators, xenophobes are just one kind of shopper in the marketplace of ideas.\nBut the temptation of the argument that even hate speech should be allowed in a place of learning in the name of unfettered thought is wrong-headed, because white nationalism is based on a brutal and artificial hierarchy. This separatism harms higher learning. Society progresses when ideas are vulnerable to different people, fresh ways of thinking and new knowledge. Inclusion fuels the machine of higher education — the main reason I cringe every time I hear, “College isn’t for everyone.”\nJoin the conversation later on Andre Perry’s radio show, “Free College,” hosted Tuesdays on WBOK1230 in New Orleans at 3pm Central/4pm Eastern 504.260.9265.\nBigoted white nationalist speech isn’t just harmful to learning; the ideology of white supremacy manifests corrupted actions, too. White nationalists have often resorted to violence against those who are different from them or those who prove them wrong using the tools of reason, ethics and science.\nJust last week, University of Maryland-College Park student Sean Christopher Urbanski killed Richard W. Collins III, 23, a soon-to-be graduate of nearby Bowie State University. Urbanski, a white local boy from Severna Park, Md., stabbed Collins as he waited for an Uber car at a bus stop close to the College Park campus. Urbanski subscribes to the Facebook group “Alt-Reich,” which promotes hatred for people of color, “and especially African-Americans,” University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell said.\nFor Collins, a second lieutenant in the intelligence branch of the army, the world seemed wide open. “He loved lacrosse and soccer. He was a runner,” said his father, Richard Collins Jr., who described him as a competitor at heart. Collins III was in the Bowie Reserve Officers’ Training Corps and was certified to jump out of aircraft.\nHis murder by the hands of a white supremacist proves that there are some organizations and people who should not be welcomed to the hallowed halls of higher education. When white nationalist celebrity Richard Spencer said “Our time has come,” during a December 2016 visit to Texas A\u0026M University, he put the lives of every person of color at that campus in jeopardy. Yet administrators allow separatist bullies like Spencer to run on the college yard, and make room for clubs that spew white nationalism and xenophobia.\nAs a Maryland alum, I am heartbroken, but not surprised that a fellow “Terp” killed a black man.\nIn 2015, University of Maryland-College Park student activists and alumni succeeded in pushing its Board of Regents into changing the name of the football stadium, which once bore the name of a former university president who opposed racial integration, to an untainted and artless Maryland Stadium.\nDuring the official proceedings regarding the name change, the university president, Wallace D. Loh, said in support of the switch, “The values of the past are no longer the values of today.”\nMany of us knew changing campus culture would be that much harder. Maryland’s path toward inclusion is already littered with antagonistic and demeaning acts against people of color, even after the Supreme Court ruled segregation unconstitutional in 1954, including campus-endorsed events featuring the use of blackface until the late 1960s, and other hateful incidents that have gotten a pass as “free speech” up to now.\nThere are certainly people in Maryland who would love to make it “great” (read: white) again. Two years after the stadium name change, a noose was found in a fraternity row house, and white nationalist flyers began appearing on campus. One implored white students to “report any and all illegal aliens. They are criminals.” In case you forgot, they reminded you that “America is a white nation.”\nMaryland was a slave state, a border state that sided with the Union but always had its own civil war. In the 1930s, the racist former university president Harry “Curley” Byrd chose the mascot of a terrapin to unify the then-all-white student body. (Today, a more appropriate rallying cry would be in support of the Collins family, not the terrapin.) Currently, the University of Maryland has one of the nation’s most diverse campuses, with students of color comprising 37 percent of the undergraduate and graduate populations combined in fall 2016. However, less than 9 percent of its tenured faculty members are black or Hispanic.\nRelated: Betsy DeVos should know robbing Peter to pay Paul is a sin in education\nShaken by Collins’ murder, the university issued a five-part action plan that includes a rapid-response team for any hate-bias incident, $100,000 in supplemental funds for the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, development of an annual report on all hate-bias incidents, strengthening the existing intercollegiate athletics policy to explicitly prohibit any hate-bias symbols or actions in any athletic venue, and establishment of a task force on hate-bias and campus safety.\nThe Maryland’s Black Student Union welcomed the university’s response but also demanded that it “clearly define hate speech and not merely address it as a form of freedom of speech.”\nCan we say that separatist paraphernalia and symbols have no place at universities as well as the organizations and people who proliferate them? For what kind of place turns the other cheek while hate-filled white supremacists rally others behind their cause and make targets of anyone who doesn’t comply? How many more deaths will it take for universities to learn that some ideologies should not be welcome?\nMy new favorite line is a little more blunt: Stop treating hate groups like a philosophy 101 course, before someone else gets killed.\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

But once you get west of Harrisburg, things get a little trickier. There's only one round-trip train a day between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh.\nAdvocates and lawmakers from Pennsylvania have been working for years to add two trips a day to the schedule. And finally, the issue is seeing some acceleration in the legislature.\nState Senator Randy Vulakovich has proposed SR76, a resolution that would direct the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee to undertake a nine-month feasibility study — the first step in adding more daily trips. The Senate Transportation Committee passed the resolution unanimously. Now, it goes to the full Senate for a vote.\n\"The hope is that at the end of the nine months, there will be a clear picture of what will be needed so that PennDOT and Amtrak and Norfolk-Southern can get together and move forward with a plan to implement service,\" said Mark Spada, president of Western Pennsylvanians for Passenger Rail.\nIf this feels like a baby step, that's because it is — a resolution to start a study that might conclude that the stakeholders should all sit down together and discuss the possibility of expanding service. But it's a lot more traction than this issue has gotten in the past, and if the resolution succeeds, would address the first and largest road block: no one knows how much this whole thing would cost.\nGovernment agencies like PennDOT, companies like Amtrak and Norfolk-Southern, and advocacy groups like WPPR and the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership all have their own studies that they've undertaken and numbers that they quote. WPPR estimates between $10 million and $12 million to add two more trips a day. PennDOT has quoted a cost of $3.75 million to $6 million for each additional trip.\nThis nine-month period would include a review of all the existing studies on the issue to hopefully form some sort of consensus around the cost and benefits of adding two more daily trains.\nFrom there, it's really up to PennDOT to decide to fund the additional trains. Norfolk-Southern, the freight rail company that owns the tracks, would also have to agree to rent additional space to passenger trains. (Amtrak owns the tracks east of Harrisburg, which is one reason there are so many more daily trains.)\nBut for now, Spada and other western Pennsylvanians advocating for more passenger rail are just happy that their issue is finally getting discussed in the legislature.\n\"Passing the resolution to allow the study to go forward would hopefully show the overall interest in additional service and benefits it would bring to western Pennsylvania,\" said Spada.\nSen.

Now she loves making the Cape Fear Botanical Garden bloom.\nAdriana Quiñones, the woman in charge of making flowers bloom year-round at the Cape Fear Botanical Garden in Fayetteville, wanted nothing to do with flowers when she was a child.\nIt’s because her mother took up breeding daffodils when Quiñones was young.\n“She loved daffodils, everything about daffodils,” Quiñones said. The family’s yard was filled with the flowers, and springtimes were consumed with daffodil season.\n“Well, it just so happens my birthday is in April, which is the height of daffodil season in Ohio. So multiple times, my mom forgot my birthday,” Quiñones said.\nEach Sunday we profile someone in the community who is doing something noteworthy or interesting. Let us know about your friends, family or neighbors who you believe should be considered by sending an email to news@fayobserver.com with “Meet″ in the subject line.\n“I never had a Sweet 16 or anything like that,” she said. “Totally forgotten in the midst of daffodil seasons. I grew up hating anything to do with flowers. Hating it.”\nBut now Quiñones, who is 51, not only loves plants and flowers, she studied their genetics in graduate school, where she discovered three genes that cause a tree to produce flowers. She has covered much of her body with tattoos of flowers.\nSince April 2014 Quiñones has been the director of horticulture at the Botanical Garden and the garden’s interim executive director since September.\nAs the horticulture director, Quiñones decides what kind of plants populate the garden, which since its founding in 1989 on Cross Creek at the Cape Fear River has become a prime attraction in Fayetteville.\nThis past fall, for example, Quiñones had 16,000 tulips planted. Their blooms filled much of the property in April, to the delight of visitors.\nQuiñones went through her 20s as a hairstylist, a wife, and the mother of three children.\nShe said she didn’t turn toward flora until she was 30.\nShe was living in the country, felt “bored to death” and wanted something to do. She volunteered at the Dawes Arboretum in Newark, Ohio, to help them make Christmas wreaths.\nThe plant propagator invited Quiñones to help him propagate trees, she said.\n“And it was trees that actually did it for me,” she said. “The permanence of them. The stateliness of them. They last hundreds and hundreds of years. And not like a daylily or a daffodil that’s here one day and gone the next. And that’s what I fell in love with.”\nThe volunteer work led Quiñones to get a bachelor degree in agriculture (with a focus on horticulture) in 2002. She celebrated her graduation with her first tattoo. Near the top of her back, it depicts the white-and-yellow flowers of a stewartia tree, her favorite.\nQuiñones later got a master’s of science degree in horticulture and eventually ended up with an office job making educational programs for a national horticulture association. But she didn’t enjoy it.\nShe realized she needed a new job when she saw landscapers working on the grounds outside her window and she wished she were working with them.\nAnd that brought Quiñones to Fayetteville in 2014, when the Cape Fear Botanical Garden hired her to be its horticulture director.\nQuiñones revels in the property, excited to talk with visitors about the trees, flowers and wildlife on its 80 acres. She touches the flowers as she talks about them and even pets the bees sipping their nectar.\n“This is a place people can come and enjoy nature on so many levels,” Quiñones said.\n“If they just need a peaceful place to walk, this place is a place to come,” she said. “If they want to learn about plants, this is a place to come. If they want to know, ‘What grows best in my yard?’ this is the place to come. If they want to bring their children to learn stuff, this is the place to come.”\nStaff writer Paul Woolverton can be reached at pwoolverton@fayobserver.com, 910-486-3512 and 910-261-4710."},{"url":"http://www.caller.com/story/news/2017/06/05/voestalpine-offers-pay-black-dust-clean-up/370345001","title":"Voestalpine offers to pay for black dust clean up","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Corpus Christi Caller-Times","description":"The Austrian iron manufacturer offers to","date":"","full_text":"PORTLAND - Iron manufacturer Voestalpine Texas says it will pay to clean up properties that were damaged by a mysterious black material that has turned up in parts of Portland.\nThe Austrian company said in a statement it has been contacted by residents near the plant whose property was affected by the gritty, dust-like material.

Refugees and migrants are driven by the fact that they arrive in Europe and put themselves on the radar screens of international and western policymakers. It is a visible phenomenon.\"\nMore aid was spent last year on refugee resettlement than in the countries where the crises began, said the IDMC.\n\"The IDPs are behind the sovereignty of a country's border and are far less visible. People tend not to think about them as readily as refugees and migrants.\"\nNumbers to rise\nThe total number of IDPs has doubled since 2000 and stands at 40.3 million as of December 2016. The numbers are likely to rise further if conditions stay the same as last year, said Bilak.\n\"Looking at the conflicts around the world as well as climate change issues, we don't expect the numbers to go down anytime soon in either case [conflict or natural disasters]. The only way the numbers can decrease is if there is more investment on working on the underlying drivers that force people to flee - poverty reduction, peace building and climate change.\"\nThe report also highlighted the intensity of the humanitarian crisis in Congo and how there is a \"need for more development spending to be allocated to reducing existing vulnerabilities and future risk and for mitigating the longer-term impacts of internal displacement\".\nAlmost five million people were killed in Congo between 1994 and 2003 as a result of ethnic violence. Almost 19,000 UN troops are currently protecting Congolese people from violence in Congo amid calls by the United States to reduce that number despite increasing attacks and instability.\n\"That DRC figure really took us all a bit by surprise. Over the last four to five years, it was usually the Middle East that was consistently high on the list and DRC had fallen off the agenda,\" said Bilak.\n\"It's unrealistic to expect the international community to solve a problem as huge as the DRC alone. It's a protracted crisis. There is very little humanitarian assistance on the ground in some parts.\"\nThe Syrian refugee crisis remains one of the largest humanitarian crises since the end of World War II.\nThe number of refugees who have fled the country now exceeds five million, including more than 2.4 million children, and millions more have been displaced internally, according to the UN.\nAt least 23,544 civilians were displaced between May 18 and 22, 2016, added the UN.\n\"People say displacement is a domestic issue and should be resolved at a domestic level. Many see it as an encroachment at national sovereignty. Internal displacement requires its own set of principles and the approach is very different from the refugee and migrant issue.\"\nAdditionally, many refugees returning to their home country fear the risk of being internally displaced once they return. Large-scale returns were mirrored by a considerable increase in the number of IDPs in 46 percent of cases between 2000 and 2016, according to the World Bank.\nWATCH: Syria - Displaced families in Idlib face harsh Ramadan (2:32)\nThe IDMC presented the case of around 600,000 Afghans returning from Pakistan. UNHCR estimates that around half of them were unable to return to their place of origin.\nDestructive floods and landslides in northern China killed at least 154 people and accounted for the majority of those displaced.\nTyphoons, floods and landslides were the major causes of displacement in Philippines (5.9 million), India (2.4 million) and Indonesia (1.2 million) last year.\nJan Egeland, the head of the NRC, said the shocking figures show the need to focus as much on people displaced inside their countries than on refugees who flee across borders.\n\"Internally displaced people now outnumber refugees by two to one. It is urgent to put internal displacement back on the global agenda,\" said Egeland.\nA number of the IDPs, in search of improved conditions then cross over into a different country, said the IDMC. As a result, \"today's IDPs could become tomorrow's refugees\".\n\"We know there's an overlap but there is not enough data to be able to put a number to that phenomenon. We have the number of IDPs in a country but the minute they cross a border, not all of them appear on UNHCR registers. Many fall between the cracks. We know it's happening.

The service providers have put their chips in the game,\" Winder said. \"It remains to be seen if others are going to put their chips in the game.\"\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done\nFollowing the morning's announcement, Biskupski called a news conference of her own, saying it is \"frustrating\" to hear the county's criticisms.\n\"It's easy for people to stand up and stand in front of microphones and act as though they have figured out a path forward that has been vetted and is funded, and that we are somehow not latching on to that,\" she said. \"It's frustrating for the city to have partners that are engaged in this kind of activity.\"\nBiskupski praised the diligence of city staffers across numerous departments who have worked to ensure efforts in the area and plausible, cost-effective and supported by the community. She later called the county's criticisms a disparagement of employees' work.\n\"Every day we realize victories, we save lives and we arrest criminals. We are getting results. We are helping people who are addicted, and we are getting them the treatment they need and off of our streets,\" Biskupski said.\nMcAdams wasn't as critical, acknowledging that environmental changes near the Road Home are the \"prerogative\" of the city.\nBut the county mayor also said Salt Lake City's current proposal — which includes transforming a portion of the 500 West median into a secure parking lot for police officers, additional security cameras, among other things — isn't enough.\n\"The situation is complicated and difficult,\" McAdams said in an interview. \"We're happy to see that they're making some changes there, and we applaud the changes they are making, but we think more can be done.\"\nCounty leaders have presented their ideas to the City Council and Biskupski, and both seemed \"receptive,\" McAdams said. However, the county mayor said he hasn't been able to schedule a follow-up meeting with Biskupski since their last discussion on the topic in early April.\n\"We recognize (Rio Grande) is a city responsibility, so we're respectful of their domain,\" McAdams said. \"We just think we have perspective and ideas to offer, and we're eager to collaborate.\"\nBiskupski indicated that the city's efforts are already effective, but that she's open to new ideas. However, she contends that the recommendations from the county aren't funded and haven't been vetted.\nBrown applauded the mayor for a budget that allocates $3 million for mitigating problems in the Rio Grande area, along with $7 million toward staffing for officers and social workers.\nAccording to Brown, Salt Lake City police officers seized 58 percent more drugs last year, including 189,000 individual doses of meth, heroine and other drugs. The seizures amount to $1.5 million worth of street-level drugs that have been taken from dealers, he said.\nMeanwhile, for those battling substance abuse disorders or mental illness, Brown said that rather than arrests, police are directing those in the area to government services, nonprofit groups and treatment facilities for help.\nBrown said \"true change\" occurs over time, with no easy shortcut.\nIn an interview prior to Tuesday's announcement, Shaleane Gee, Salt Lake County's director of special projects and partnerships, said the county and service providers are interested in advancing the conversation with the city on how to transform the Road Home to more of a homelessness resource center sooner than when new resource centers open their doors.\n\"We're not going to wait until 2019 to all of a sudden have a new model,\" Gee said. \"We're asking, 'How can we do it now?'\"\n\"What (the city has) is a good start, but in our view, we need some more aggressive measures,\" said Noella Sudbury, the county's Criminal Justice Advisory Council coordinator.\nThe list of recommendations include:\n• Explore closing — even temporarily or for a few hours each day — Rio Grande Street between the Road Home and Catholic Community Services to create a \"service delivery space\" and prevent drive-through drug dealing, potentially with a tented area.\n• Alternatively, work with police and transportation engineers to explore making Rio Grande Street and 500 West one-way traffic to prevent drive-through criminal traffic.\n• Develop a plan to transform the island strip along 500 West, whether it be a private lease agreement allowing it to be policed more effectively, or a public garden model similar to what the city has suggested to accommodate individuals with community outreach programs, such as the Downtown Alliance's \"street team.\"\n• Work with law enforcement to constitutionally enforce the camping ordinances and eliminate the widespread use of camps to hide and further illegal activity.\n• Involve Utah Highway Patrol, Utah Transit Authority and other agencies in patrolling the area for criminal activity.\n• Relocate the state liquor store at 205 W. 400 South.\nSudbury said the list was compiled from ideas offered by \"many private, public and community partners.\"\nThe partial or temporary closure of Rio Grande Street could also entail \"tenting\" portions of the area between the shelter and St. Vincent de Paul Dining Hall so the entire area can be used for homeless services, Gee said.\n\"The point is: How do we start thinking about that street not as a no man's land, but as a programmable service space? We want to explore that,\" she said.\nSudbury said the county is also hoping to advance conversations with the city to better enforce camping ordinances.\n\"There are people who camp because they're homeless; there are people who camp because they like to camp,\" she said. \"But what we don't want to see is camping to hide illegal drug use and other criminal activity that's going on.\"\nIn order to enforce the law without violating the Constitution, Sudbury said the city has to provide other places for them to go, which means leaders must work with the city attorney's office and police to figure out a way. The county wants to encourage a conversation to find a solution, she said.\nGee said providers of services for the homeless are also enacting a slew of operating changes to shift the Road Home toward a resource model, including moving families out and into housing by July 15.\nRoad Home operators have also agreed to \"phase out\" queuing outside the shelter by making it so people don't have to line up on 500 West to get services, she said.\n\"We want to work with (service) providers right now to more meet what will be the new model in the new resource centers,\" Gee said. \"So we're thinking about the changing the way individuals come in to receive service.\"\nContributing: Peter Samore, McKenzie Romero"},{"url":"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/supreme-court-strikes-2-redrawn-districts-n-c-racial-bias","title":"Supreme Court strikes down 2 redrawn districts in N.C. over racial bias","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"PBS NewsHour","description":"The justices ruled that Republicans who controlled the state legislature and governor's office in 2011 placed too many African-Americans in the two districts.

The result was to weaken African-American voting strength elsewhere in North Carolina.\nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has ruled for civil rights groups and black voters in challenges to political districts in Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia.\nA Democratic group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder is focusing on redistricting challenges to counter political gains Republicans have made since the 2010 census and the redrawing of electoral districts that followed.\nIn North Carolina, both districts have since been redrawn and the state conducted elections under the new congressional map in 2016. Even with the new districts, Republicans maintained their 10-3 edge in congressional seats.\nA separate challenge has been filed to the redrawn districts, this time claiming that politics played too much of a role in their creation. The Supreme Court has never ruled that a partisan gerrymander violates the Constitution.\nJustice Elena Kagan, writing for the court, said the state did not offer compelling justifications to justify its reliance on race in either district.\nThe issue of race and redistricting one is a familiar one at the Supreme Court and Kagan noted that one of the districts was “making its fifth(!) appearance before this court.”\nStates have to take race into account when drawing maps for legislative, congressional and a host of municipal political districts. At the same time, race can’t be the predominant factor without very strong reasons, under a line of high court cases stretching back 20 years.\nA three-judge federal court had previously struck down the two districts. The justices upheld the lower court ruling on both counts.\nThe court unanimously affirmed the lower court ruling on District 1 in northeastern North Carolina. Kagan wrote that the court will not “approve a racial gerrymander whose necessity is supported by no evidence.”\nThe justices split 5-3 on the other district, District 12 in the southwestern part of the state. Justice Clarence Thomas joined the four liberal justices to form a majority. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy dissented. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in the case.\nThe state insisted that race played no role at all in the creation of one district. Instead, the state argued that Republicans who controlled the redistricting process wanted to leave the district in Democratic hands, so that the surrounding districts would be safer for Republicans.\n“The evidence offered at trial…adequately supports the conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for the district’s reconfiguration,” Kagan wrote.\nAlito said in dissent that the evidence instead shows that the district’s borders “are readily explained by political considerations.”\nVoting rights advocates said the ruling supports their arguments in yet another case pending before the Supreme Court that challenges North Carolina’s state legislative districts. A federal court had previously thrown out 28 state House and Senate districts as illegal racial gerrymanders.\nBut earlier this year the Supreme Court temporarily halted an order to redraw those legislative districts. The justices could act on the challenge to the state districts as early as next week.\nThe lawyer leading the challenge to the state districts, Anita Earls of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, said Monday’s ruling has clear implications for that case.\n“It’s abundantly clear that what the state of North Carolina did in drawing its legislative districts cannot withstand constitutional muster,” she said in a phone interview.\nThe court action comes at a time of intense political division in the state, highlighted by legal battles over moves by the GOP-controlled legislature to pass laws limiting some of the powers of North Carolina’s new Democratic governor, Roy Cooper. Democrats have hoped that a redrawing of state districts could help them erode veto-proof majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly.\nCooper issued a statement applauding Supreme Court for supporting “a level playing field and fair elections” for voters.\n“The North Carolina Republican legislature tried to rig Congressional elections by drawing unconstitutional districts that discriminated against African Americans and that’s wrong,” Cooper said.\nThe Rev. William Barber, the president of the North Carolina NAACP who has sued separately over voting rights, said the high court’s ruling shows that the General Assembly “engaged in systemic racism and cheated to win elections.”\nHolder said the National Democratic Redistricting Committee that he leads “will aggressively pursue new cases to end similar illegal racial gerrymandering in other states.”\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan Drew contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina."},{"url":"http://khn.org/news/californias-new-single-payer-proposal-embraces-some-costly-old-ways","title":"California’s New Single-Payer Proposal Embraces Some Costly Old Ways","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Kaiser Health News","description":"The legislation would revive the age-old practice of paying providers for every service they perform — a recipe for a busted budget, some experts say. Backers say the bill is a work in progress.","date":"2017-05-31","full_text":"Three of the dirtiest words in health care are “fee for service.”\nFor years, U.S. officials have sought to move Medicare away from paying doctors and hospitals for each task they perform, a costly approach that rewards the quantity of care over quality. State Medicaid programs and private insurers are pursuing similar changes.\nYet the $400 billion single-payer proposal that’s advancing in the California legislature would restore fee-for-service to its once-dominant perch in California.\nA state Senate analysis released last week warned that fee-for-service and other provisions in the legislation would “strongly limit the state’s ability to control costs.” Cost containment will be key in persuading lawmakers and the public to support the increased taxes that would be necessary to finance this ambitious, universal health care system for 39 million Californians.\nSeveral health experts expressed skepticism about the bill’s prospects in its current form.\n“Single-payer has its pros and cons, but if it’s built on the foundation of fee-for-service it will be a disaster,” said Stephen Shortell, dean emeritus of the School of Public Health at the University of California-Berkeley. “It would be a huge step backwards in delivering health care.”\nPaul Ginsburg, a health economist and professor at the University of Southern California, agreed and said the legislation reads like something out of the 1960s in terms of how it wants to reimburse providers.\n“There’s broad consensus we ought to go from volume to value. This bill ignores all the signs pointing to progress and advocates a system that failed,” he said.\nBackers of the Healthy California proposal are pushing for a vote in the Senate by Friday so the legislation can go to the state Assembly and remain in play for this year’s session.\nThe authors say that their single-payer proposal won’t rely entirely on old-fashioned fee-for-service and that there’s plenty of time for the bill to be amended. According to the authors, some of the criticism in the legislative analysis reflects a misreading of the bill: It would, they say, include some use of managed care.\nIn managed care organizations such as HMOs, providers receive a lump sum every month based on how many people they have enrolled. The idea is to encourage providers to offer preventive care and to scrutinize every test or treatment, since they bear the losses if they go over budget.\nMore than other states, California embraced this approach. In its Medicaid program, about 80 percent of enrollees are in managed care.\nMichael Lighty, director of public policy for the California Nurses Association/National Nurses United, the lead sponsor of the California bill said “it will be a mixed-payment approach. Per capita payments are envisioned in this system.”\n“We want to address how different payment methodologies work before mandating specifics in the bill,” he added.\nLighty said more provisions to curtail costs will be added shortly.\nAs opposition builds over congressional efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, progressives in California and New York have responded to the ACA repeal threat by crafting proposals for universal coverage. (Such efforts failed earlier in Vermont and Colorado.)\nSingle-payer supporters are tapping into Americans’ deep dissatisfaction with the high costs and red tape embedded in the current hodgepodge of private insurance and public programs. But some defenders of the existing national health law say single-payer proposals are a costly distraction from the immediate fight in Washington over the health care safety net that millions of Americans rely on.\nThe California legislation, Senate Bill 562, requires that payments to providers be made on a “fee-for-service basis unless and until another payment methodology is established by the [Healthy California] board,” according to the bill.\nIt says health care delivery systems can choose to be paid on a capitated basis. But the analysis by the state Senate Appropriations Committee said it may be difficult for the single-payer program to establish such a payment system because of other features in the law, such as patients’ ability to see any provider with no referral necessary. A report in April from the state Senate Health Committee made a similar determination, saying multiple provisions in this bill “would make cost control unlikely to occur.”\nThe bill doesn’t address other innovative approaches being rolled out across California and the country. For instance, Medicare and private insurers are shifting to “bundled payments” for knee and hip surgeries, in which providers are paid a set fee for all treatment. More physician groups and hospitals are forming accountable care organizations (ACOs), which try to coordinate care within a budget.\nWhile fee-for-service medicine can lead to excessive spending, Lighty said, ACOs and other “pay-for-performance” initiatives haven’t been entirely effective at reining in costs either.\nThe California bill faces another daunting challenge: coming up with the estimated $400 billion annually required to pay for universal coverage. Existing government money used for health care could cover half of that amount, but the other half may need to come from payroll taxes on workers and employers — not a politically palatable prospect. (The taxes could be offset in some measure by reduced health spending by employers and workers.)\nEvery Californian, regardless of age, employment or immigration status, would be eligible for coverage and there would be no premiums, copayments or deductibles. In addition, patients could see any willing provider without a referral and receive any service deemed medically appropriate.\nThose factors would make it difficult for the program to use “drug formularies, prior authorization requirements or other utilization management tools,” the Senate analysts wrote. As a result, they estimated that health care utilization may increase by 10 percent compared to fee-for-service in Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program.\nAt a hearing May 22, state Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Tehama) said the single-payer proposal appears to invite patients to “come in for what’s almost like a blank check.”\nState Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens), a chief sponsor of the bill, acknowledged the concern and said he’s looking at what single-payer systems outside the U.S. do to contain costs.\nThe bill’s sponsors are opposed to the proliferation of narrow insurance networks that exclude providers to keep costs down. But the Senate analysis said that approach means the state couldn’t use potential exclusion from the single-payer system as a means of negotiating favorable prices, as health insurers often do.\nLighty said significant costs can be pared from the current system in other ways. For instance, consumers will no longer subsidize lavish salaries for hospital CEOs and excessive profits because reimbursements will be tied to “efficiently providing health care services.”\nLara said eliminating the middleman role of health insurers and consolidating the state’s purchasing power would lead to huge savings. “By pooling health care funds in a publicly run fund, we get the bargaining power of the seventh-largest economy in the world,” he said.\nInsurers and brokers in California and nationwide oppose single-payer proposals because they could literally put them out of business. And legislative analysts and health policy experts question whether California would be able to exert sufficient bargaining power. They noted the political constraints that Medicare has faced in flexing its market power on prices.\n“Our system of government may mean single-payer is much less successful than in other countries,” Ginsburg said. “We are so open to lobbying it means we can’t count on some of the very strong actions other countries have taken to keep costs down.”\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation."},{"url":"http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/05/27/long-frustrating-journey-lyme-disease-diagnosis/350300001","title":"Long, frustrating journey to Lyme disease diagnosis","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Post-Crescent Media","description":"Jennifer Achterberg: If you feel you have Lyme, do not passively wait for a diagnosis.","date":"","full_text":"I was diagnosed with Lyme disease in January after months of doctor visits.\nI made my first doctor’s appointment for vague symptoms including fatigue, abdominal weight gain, constipation and minor muscle pain.\nAfter a variety of tests, there was no definitive answer to what the problem was. The symptoms persisted and eventually brought friends with them, including irregular heartbeat, pin and needle sensations, numbness throughout my body, brain fog, mood swings and a feeling of restricted breathing (air hunger).\nI had never experienced anything this severe and I felt as if any day could be my last.\nI was getting no results from my health care provider, so I decided to get a second opinion. My new provider tested me for Lyme disease. The test results were negative because blood tests for Lyme disease are horribly inaccurate.\nI was sent to several specialists including a cardiologist, rheumatologist and neurologist. I was tested for everything under the sun, and the doctors came back empty handed.\nIt’s unbelievable that in the year 2016, science could not explain what was happening to me. This time was the all-time low in my life. I felt worse every week and no one could tell me why. Since the specialists did not have answers, I asked my general physician to refer me to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. I was optimistic I would get a diagnosis and start feeling better soon.\nI was wrong.\nI spent four days in Rochester and was tested and retested for a variety of ailments, including Lyme disease.\nI asked for the Lyme disease test after reading that many people who suffer from the illness even after countless blood tests “prove” they don’t have it.\nAt one point, I asked my Mayo physician if my symptoms could be related to Lyme disease. His response was “As you probably already know, we don’t believe in chronic Lyme.”\nI drove back to Wisconsin with no diagnosis.\nDetermined to get my health back, I continued to seek sources who could help me. My journey to healing began when I heard about a Lyme Literate Medical Doctor. He asked why I was in his office.\nIn a desperate voice, I said, “You are my last hope. I have been tested for everything.”\nAfter listening to my symptoms, he had no doubt I contracted Lyme disease. I was relieved.\nSince my Lyme diagnosis, I’ve tried many treatments and am on the slow path to recovery. Although I am not 100 percent myself, I am doing better.\nHowever, I am deeply disturbed by my journey. I struggle to understand why it took so long to diagnose a disease so common to where I live.\nYet, I am lucky — many Lyme sufferers are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed for years. In the U.S., there are over 30,000 Lyme diagnoses each year, with many in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and 10 states on the East coast.\nIf your health deteriorates with no explanation, do not take a lack of diagnosis for an answer. There is a lack of knowledge surrounding this disease. If you feel you have Lyme, do not passively wait for a diagnosis — seek out a Lyme Literate Medical Doctor.\nIn loving memory of Dr. Hoffman.\nJennifer Achterberg is a Clintonville resident.

Amid a looming deadline for a review of a controversial monument within sacred tribal lands, Zinke hasn’t picked up the phone for the very Indigenous leaders that could be most impacted by his decision.\nOn Wednesday morning, the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition held a conference call responding to President Donald Trump’s executive order on monuments. Leaders of the coalition, which represents the Hopi Tribe, Navajo Nation, Ute Indian Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and Pueblo of Zuni, requested an audience with the Interior secretary. They say Zinke, since he took the helm of the Department of the Interior, has been conspicuously reclusive with the tribal nations he promised to represent.\nLast week Trump ordered a review of all national monuments of more than 100,000 acres created since 1996, plus sites that may have received insufficient public input prior to designation. Zinke has until June 10 to issue a recommendation of potential changes to Bears Ears National Monument and 120 days to issue a final report on two dozen other monuments.\nDuring the call, made from the National Press Club, in Washington, D.C., leaders from the Navajo Nation, Ute Indian Tribe and other Southwest tribes criticized Zinke for ignoring multiple requests to meet with them and discuss Bears Ears. The monument, enacted in the final days of the Obama administration, created a collision of Western issues that include tribal sovereignty, federal overreach and public land management.\nAfter the call on Wednesday, E\u0026E News reports that Zinke met with members of the Ute Indian Tribe, but many leaders of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition say they have yet to discuss the monument review with him. Zinke has not said publicly why he hasn’t met with certain crucial tribal stakeholders, but Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift told the Salt Lake Tribune “consultation is a priority of the secretary, and (Zinke) recognizes that tribes are an important voice in this review process.”\nAs a Montana representative, Zinke generally had a positive record with Montana tribes. He introduced and championed the Blackfeet water compact, an agreement that confirmed water rights to the Blackfeet Nation, and will provide $471 million in state and federal funding for water infrastructure projects on the reservation. Zinke has also supported federal recognition for the Little Shell Band of Chippewa Cree, in Great Falls, Montana. Harry Barnes, chairman of the Blackfeet Nation, told The Helena Independent that Zinke’s appointment was “a great day for Montana” and that “Montana tribes will have an ear in the Department of the Interior, which oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs.” In March Zinke told the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that tribal “sovereignty should mean something.”\nBut in the early days of the Trump administration, members of a number of Southwestern tribes say that the new secretary’s early actions don’t align with his claims. Shaun Chapoose, chairman of the Ute Indian Tribe’s business committee, said Zinke “has an important role to play” in establishing the relationship between tribes and the nascent administration.\n“When Zinke came in we were hopeful that, because he had a relationship with tribes, he would be able to engage us in a meaningful way and hear our point of view,” Chapoose said in response to a question about Zinke’s early track record. “So, it is very troubling in this sense with monuments so far, because he has not even given the time to respond to our multiple requests to meet with him.”\nFurther angering some tribal leaders, Zinke has found time to meet with Utah state lawmakers, who want reduced or rescinded boundaries for the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments. According to the Interior Department, Zinke will visit Utah next week as part of his review, and the secretary said Tuesday that his trip will include a horseback tour of monument sites. “I’m going to ride a horse, like Teddy Roosevelt, and see the land and talk to the Navajo and the nations of tribes,” Zinke said at a conference in Houston, Texas, where he signed an order to review offshore drilling bans, according to Reuters.\nFollowing Wednesday’s conference call from D.C., a staffer from the Bureau of Land Management’s Utah office called the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition on behalf of Interior to set up a meeting with Zinke. According to the coalition, tribal leaders will meet with the Interior secretary on Sunday in Salt Lake City.\nBut if Zinke doesn’t show up, leaders of the coalition say they’re committed to taking the issue to court if he fails to meet them before the deadline to make a recommendation on monuments. “I’m disappointed in the way he has treated me at this stage,” Chapoose said. “The way we’re going to fight this is to go to court. It’s a critical time. A lot of this can be avoided, but the clock is ticking, and if he doesn’t engage us, there’s no way of turning it back.”\nNote: This story has been updated to correct the Grand Canyon Trust’s role in the tribal coalition’s meeting with Ryan Zinke.

Austin Stout and Cameron Emerson have also been added to the squad and are cleared to play Friday.\nBrian Paredes, a starting defender from last year's roster, is questionable to appear after fighting an injury over the last two weeks.\nThe match kicks off at 7 p.m. at Robert E. Rich All-High Stadium (2885 Main St.). Tickets are $7 in advance or $8 at the door.\nWHO'S NEW?: Dragomir, who began his college career at University of Nevada Las Vegas and eventually starred at Montana State-Billings, received official clearance on Thursday, and his presence - if selected by head coach Frank Butcher - could spark an attack that is still searching for its first goal after 180 scoreless minutes.\nAs mentioned in our season preview, the native of Romania potted 12 goals in his final year of eligibility, earning NSCAA All-West Second Team honors in D-2.\nStout, a midfielder, played sparingly in his first two years with West Virginia before scoring twice - both game-winners - in 16 matches with Duquesne, who's coached by former Niagara University gaffer Chase Brooks.\nEmerson, a New Zealand native like FC Buffalo teammates Fox Slotemaker and Cameron Hogg, represented his country at the U-17 level before coming to the U.S. The central midfielder played one season at Patrick Henry Community College before finding a home at Anderson University, an NCAA Division II school in South Carolina. The 6'2 Kiwi scored three times and added an assist in his first year at Anderson.\nWHO LET THE DOGZ OUT?: Fond memories are scarce for the Wolves in terms of past meetings with Rochester, who've re-branded from the RiverDogz to the Lancers after just one season under the former nickname. Last year, Rochester spoiled FC Buffalo's home opener, 1-0, behind a Luke Pavone goal, then put the Wolves' playoff hopes in major jeopardy with a 2-1 win at SUNY Brockport.\nAfter the Lancers changeover, Marc Mandell remains an owner in the side, while former Buffalo Blizzard star Doug Miller has taken the head coaching reins from Matt Tantalo, who now coaches Syracuse FC. In an interesting twist, Miller was previously head coach of the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) side Syracuse Silver Knights in 2016.\nSalvatore \"Soccer Sam\" Fantauzzo, former owner of the MISL team in Rochester, joins Mandell in the ownership group, with business director Nick Mojsovski as the third partner.\nKNOW THE FOE: A handful of names dotting the Lancers' roster might be familiar to Buffalo soccer fans. Current Buffalo State College players Sammy Wasson and August Finn, as well as recent Bengals graduate William Banahene, have played key roles so far, while former FC Buffalo winger Anthony Rozzano and trialist Austin Gerber are also on the roster.\nThe Lancers' standouts include winger Antonio Manfut, who jumped ship from AFC Cleveland, center backs Nikkye De Point (Villanova) Jake Schindler, and terrific Genesee Community College duo William Stone and Rafael Godoi.

I soon found myself on the shiny, Squarespace-y landing page of Watsi, a San Francisco-based startup closely linked to the accelerator Y Combinator. According to its site, Watsi aims to “provide healthcare for every person in the world.” Specifically, they seek crowdfunding for individual patients around the world. A person in the Bay Area can choose between alleviating the plight of a two-month-old baby in Guatemala, a 32-year-old woman in Burma, or hundreds of other suffering human beings.\nHow does this actually work?\nLet’s look at a hypothetical example. A sick patient — let’s call her Faith — arrives at the hospital and can’t afford the treatment the doctor prescribes. She is informed by the doctor that this is a “Watsi facility” and is asked if she would like to “share her story with the world.” Faith, who is economically vulnerable and facing a non-choice between externally-funded treatment and continued disease, agrees. Her photo is then taken and uploaded, along with her sob story, to the Watsi site. A few moments later, charitably-minded voyeurs can flick through photos of her and hundreds of other desperate looking men, women, and children from around the world and play God — i.e., fund the saddest case they can find and feel good about themselves.\nIt may seem innocuously altruistic, but there are bigger implications of this work. If Watsi donors are paying for the healthcare of individuals in developing countries, what incentive do those developing country governments have to build functioning health systems?\nGetting individual donors to pay for care does not help address the structural barriers that exclude many poor people from accessing health services. It does not incentivize poor communities to demand their governments fulfill their commitment to the World Health Organization to allocate 15% of their annual budgets to healthcare. And it certainly doesn’t ensure that patients will benefit when donor interest (and dollars) fade away.\nInstead, it creates a long-term cycle of dependency and exploitation.\nThis model, not that different from of Kiva.org, exploits vulnerable people made even more vulnerable by their medical condition. In its current state, the model seems to exist more to alleviate “white guilt” than to increase access to care.\nIf the goal really were to increase patient access to life-changing care, there would be a commitment to supporting patients and to working with governments over the long term to remove those structural barriers to care, not just to giving foreign donors one-click guilt relief.\nY-Combinator and Watsi are now partnering to explore a new form of primary care built on an open software platform. In an unnamed “community in the developing world,” they’ll experiment with ways to reduce the administrative costs and increase overall health system efficiency — with the ultimate goal of making universal healthcare a reality. Very lofty and admirable goals — but again, I’m skeptical.\nWhen a colleague emailed the founders of Watsi regarding the ethics of using the developing world as a test bed for innovation, especially when lives are at stake, it prompted this reply (the bolded text is my emphasis):\nOur goal is to ensure that even if the project fails, patients are better off than if it didn’t exist…. We’re working closely with the local community, government, and providers that collectively have many, many years of experience to design the system and adhere to all local laws in such a way that no matter what, patients will benefit.\nAre the bolded words above making anyone else nervous? Or is it just me?\nThis belief that an innovative yet unproven idea will inevitably make people better off is exactly the ruse that Y-Combinator/Watsi is trying to sell. Through “experimentation” they assume they’ll find a scalable, sustainable solution that will make universal health coverage attainable. But what happens when the government can’t afford to train an entire country’s-worth of doctors and healthcare workers on this new system? What happens when the government can’t afford to procure and distribute the technology needed to use this platform? Where does that leave patients in the long run?\nThis new model for healthcare financing could be revolutionary. But rolling out an untested, unproven, and currently unsustainable model in low-income countries that will have a hard time saying no to externally-funded solutions could do more harm than good for patients.\nIf YC and Watsi are truly committed to ensuring their model really does leave patients better off, allow me to offer a few suggestions:\nTest the waters first. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and confidence in your solution, if it does indeed fail — or creates externalities that cannot justify its continued implementation- you’ll have a lot of unhappy patients and healthcare workers to answer to. Start small with a randomized control trial in one or two countries. Analyze the results. Identify where you can do better. Go back to the drawing board. Test again. People’s lives are at stake.\nStop pimping out patients. Healthcare is a human right, and should not be granted based on an individual’s state of relative piteousness. No more photos, no more sob stories. Pool donor donations and allocate randomly among the patients.\nWork yourself out of a job. That means working with governments and Ministries of Health to find the most effective and appropriate means (e.g. social insurance, sin taxes, etc.) for them to raise sufficient funds to provide universal healthcare for their population so you don’t have to. It also means developing a sustainability plan with clear targets for progressively phasing out your support.\nTake this advice to heart and we’ll all be better off.\nThe Development Set is made possible by funding from the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation.

It describes three innovative practices for Responsible Fatherhood programs. Each innovation is practical and interactive and addresses issues important to low-income fathers. The B3 team selected them for their high potential to provide useful lessons for the field. The team then collaborated with local fatherhood programs and program developers to tailor the innovations for B3. The brief is the first in a series of publications on B3, its findings, and the lessons learned.\nA father’s support — both financial and emotional — has been linked to better outcomes on nearly every measure of a child’s well-being, from cognitive development and educational achievement to self-esteem and positive behaviors toward others. However, many fathers, particularly low-income fathers, struggle to provide support. Personal and societal barriers get in the way, such as low levels of education, stigma from criminal records, declining wages for low-skilled men, or family instability. These challenges have led the field to search for innovative programming that supports men and their families.\nLocal organizations across the United States are responding by implementing Responsible Fatherhood programs. Responsible Fatherhood programs aim to improve the well-being of fathers and their children by addressing the particular challenges they face. These programs often play an important role in communities, particularly low-income communities, giving fathers a place to reflect on their familial role and plan for better futures for themselves and their children. The federal government supports these efforts through the Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood initiative, a $150 million discretionary grant program administered by Office of Family Assistance (OFA). In 2015, OFA awarded five-year Responsible Fatherhood grants to 39 organizations, Healthy Marriage grants to 46 organizations, and an additional five awards to programs that serve incarcerated fathers and fathers reentering society. Qualifying fatherhood programs use a range of curricula and practices tailored to the needs of local participants to address three primary issues: responsible parenting, healthy marriage and co-parent relationships, and economic stability.\nB3 is a partnership between six organizations that provide Responsible Fatherhood services, the MDRC-led study team, and the project funder, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families. B3 seeks to identify services that can measurably improve the outcomes of fathers who participate in Responsible Fatherhood programs. The study is designed to rigorously assess new and emerging service approaches in the field over the next three years.\nIn 2016, each of the six local programs participating in B3 added one or two program components or innovations to the usual services it offered. Practitioners will learn two main lessons from the study:\nWhether any or all of the innovations have an impact on (or make a difference in) the lives of participating fathers and their children, greater than the standard services that programs offer\nHow programs engaged fathers and implemented the services, both the innovations and existing services for fathers\nAs the study progresses, the B3 team plans to provide practitioners with updated information about whether these approaches work, what fathers (and even mothers) are saying about them, and what strategies local programs are using to deliver them. The team hopes that B3 will contribute to the broader evidence-based research on services for fathers and provide actionable information about the three specific innovations tested.\nFull"},{"url":"http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/11/29/textbooks-education-ground-zero-americas-culture-wars","title":"Textbooks Are the Education Ground Zero of America’s Culture Wars","author_text":null,"keywords":["Social Justice","Education","In The News"],"publication_text":"TakePart","description":"A fight in Texas is the latest battle over what the nation’s students are being taught.","date":"","full_text":"A fight in Texas is the latest battle over what the nation’s students are being taught.\nIt was billed as a way to teach Texas high school students about Latinos’ overlooked contributions to Lone Star State history. The new Mexican American Heritage textbook, however, was so chock-full of errors, stereotypes, and racist sentiments that protesters demanded school administrators block the book from ever appearing in classrooms.\nUnder pressure, the State Board of Education relented, unanimously voting earlier this month to shelve the book and start again from scratch. But the controversy is just the latest and highest-profile ideological skirmish over public school curricula—and the larger war over who decides what gets taught is far from over.\nIn Tennessee, a woman who helped form an anti-Islam parents group led a campaign to remove sections of a social studies text that included positive descriptions of Islam, arguing it “promotes Islamic propaganda.” In southeast Texas, an administrative committee charged with streamlining the high school biology curriculum is under fire for removing sections that critics say undermine the teaching of creationism.\nIn Portland, Oregon, meanwhile, the school board voted unanimously to ban all textbooks that question climate change, and last year in Colorado, voters replaced the entire school board over a debate on whether the uglier chapters of American history, such as slavery, should be included in the Advanced Placement U.S. History curriculum—or whether the course should, as one former member put it, “promote citizenship, patriotism, essentials and benefits of the free enterprise system, respect for authority and respect for individual rights.”\nThe clashes in Texas, Tennessee, Oregon, and elsewhere reflect a long, unsettled national battle at the intersection of education and the so-called culture wars: fights between the political left and right over religion, science, inclusion, and national identity.\nThe pushback from conservatives and the advancing of stereotypes reveal “privileged narrow views on language, culture, society, science, history, and so forth,” David E. Kirkland, a professor at New York University’s Steinhardt School of Education, told TakePart. “Within this climate, it is not beyond imagination for a complete rewriting of history and human knowledge from the constricted perspectives of a political elite—in this case, right-wing conservatives, who feel that schools and textbooks have gone overboard by spewing progress-leaning ideologies.”\n“It’s like they’ve taken to heart the African proverb: ‘Until the lion learns to write history, the story of the jungle will forever glorify its hunter,’ ” Kirkland said.\nAt issue in Texas is a push to include Mexican American history in the state history curriculum; more than half the state’s 5 million students are Latino, and most are Mexican American. Given that Texas history is intertwined with Mexico’s, some educators say it makes sense—particularly because research shows ethnic studies courses can boost some students’ performance on state tests and increase the odds they’ll graduate from high school.\nTexas’ State Board of Education called for publishers to submit books for an optional social studies course and got just one submission: Mexican American Heritage—written by a publisher who had no expertise in the subject matter. At the same time, the sample produced for the board portrayed Mexican Americans as lazy, dangerous, and led by activists who wanted a separate nation.\nAfter weeks of protests and hearings, the State Board of Education rejected the textbook in a 14–0 vote—a significant step, as Texas is one of the country’s largest textbook markets. Content developed for the state is often used as the template for books sold in other states.\nKirkland said it’s not uncommon for textbook producers or school boards to manipulate or omit facts—historical or scientific—to promote a political agenda, usually a conservative one, under the guise of balanced, unbiased education.\nRELATED: The Hands of Trump’s New Secretary of Education Might Already Be Tied\n“For example, the Texas State Board of Education has been wrestling with questions of what to put in its science textbooks for years now, deleting from textbooks—in some cases—anything that deals with climate change or evolution,” Kirkland said. “In 2009, Dr. Don McLeroy and his so-called like-minded colleagues on the [education board] were successful in requiring Texas science textbooks to address the strengths and weaknesses of scientific theories such as evolution, allowing some schools to outright deny their existences.”\nLast year, “the Texas Board of Education rejected a measure that would require university experts to fact-check the state’s textbooks in public schools,” Kirkland said. “So things like deleting and dismissing concepts such as evolution from the thinking of schools to other controversial parsings of history such as references to slaves as ‘workers’ gained state justification.”\nAt the same time, “this erasure of actual facts for propaganda is dangerous and manipulative,” Kirkland said. “Not only does it harm individuals who have their histories tainted or completely destroyed; it hurts all children who grow up believing in lies and never get to access the truth and sheer breadth and complexity” of human knowledge, history, reasoning, and rationality."},{"url":"http://www.newsminer.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/ester-is-ready-for-summer/article_548c24f4-467c-11e7-bf2e-f3002805633d.html","title":"Ester is ready for summer","author_text":"John David Ragan/Ester","keywords":["Letters To Editor"],"publication_text":"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner","description":"News-Miner letter to the editor:","date":"","full_text":"News-Miner letter to the editor:\nMay 27, 2017\nTo the editor: The Ester festival season is here, and the volunteers of the Ester community association have been working hard to get the Ester Community Park ready to go for another summer.\nOn Saturday, the Fairbanks Folk Festival will take place in the Ester Community Park from 1-10 p.m. There will be great bands and music, stands selling food and lots of room to sit on the grass of the big soccer field.

Magazine","description":"","date":"","full_text":"What’s the “Trump Doctrine” of foreign policy? At first glance, foreign policy under Trump seems inconsistent, arbitrary, and devoid of principle.\nA few weeks ago, even before the airstrike on Syria, Trump communications director Mike Dubke told Trump’s assembled aides that international affairs presented a messaging challenge because the Trump administration lacks a coherent foreign policy. “There is no Trump doctrine,” Dubke declared.\nI think Dubke is being grossly unfair. Of course there’s a Trump Doctrine. You just have to know where to look for it.\nThe Trump Doctrine began to emerge when Trump issued his travel bans (both the first and second) on predominantly Muslim countries.\nBut he notably excluded predominantly Muslim countries where Trump has business interests.\nSo under what might be called the First Principle of the Trump Doctrine, people living in a predominantly Muslim country have a chance of entering the United States only if their country contains an edifice with Trump’s name on it.\nThe Second Principle follows logically from the first. Countries that are potential markets for Trump’s business—nominally run by his two sons, but still filling his pockets—may be eligible for special favors if they allow Trump to make money there.\nFor example, Trump’s business currently has 157 trademark applications pending in 36 nations, according to The New York Times.\nRegistered trademarks are giant financial assets for a business like Trump’s, which in recent years has made big money by selling his name rather than by building or making anything.\nSoon after he was sworn into office—but only after Trump backed off of his brief flirtation with a “two China” policy—the Chinese government granted Trump preliminary approval of 38 trademarks of his name.\n“It was a gift,” said Peter J. Riebling, a trademark lawyer in Washington, D.C., of China’s decision. “Getting the exclusive right to use that brand in China against everyone else in the world? It’s like waving a magic wand.”\nOne potential obstacle for the Second Principle is the Constitution’s “emoluments” clause, which bars U.S. government officials from receiving gifts from foreign powers.\nNo matter. Apparently the Trump Doctrine, well, trumps the Constitution.\nA group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW ) joined by several prominent law professors, is suing Trump over this.\nBut the United States—through the U.S. Department of Justice—argues in a legal brief, expected to be filed this month, that the framers of the Constitution meant only to rule out gifts that compensate presidents or other office holders for services they might do for a foreign power, not for public policies they advance that benefit a foreign power.\nThe Third Principle comes down hard on countries that kill their own children with poison gas. They will be bombed.\nInterpretations of the U.S. Constitution by the Department of Justice aren’t like the musings of any random defense attorney. They carry special weight. They represent the views and interests of the United States.\nWhich makes this one official U.S. government policy—and thereby, confirms it as the Second Principle of the Trump Doctrine.\nThe Third Principle comes down hard on countries that kill their own children with poison gas. They will be bombed.\nYou may recall Trump had long been opposed to bombing Syria. But, as he recently explained, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s “attack on children … had a big impact on me,” adding that “my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much.” The bombing ensued.\nThis doesn’t mean endangered children will be given refuge in the United States, though. Recall the First Principle: Nobody gains entrance to the United States from a predominantly Muslim nation unless their country contains a Trump hotel, spa, or golf course.\nWhich brings us to the Fourth Principle.\nCould a mother of a bomb be dropped on such a group if it’s located in a country containing a Trump hotel?\nNot long after the Syrian bombing, Trump authorized the Pentagon to drop a 22,000-pound GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) on people described as “Islamic State forces” in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border.\nIt was the first time the bomb—nicknamed the “mother of all bombs,” and one of the largest air-dropped munitions in the U.S. military’s inventory—had ever been used in a combat.\nTrump’s rationale? The group was allegedly connected to ISIS.\nSo under the Fourth Principle of the Trump Doctrine, the United States reserves the right to drop a mother of a bomb on any group seemingly connected with ISIS.\nThis applies even if the group is not fighting to gain or hold territory claimed by the Islamic State. The group could be thousands of miles away from the Islamic State, anywhere around the world.\nCould a mother of a bomb be dropped on such a group if it’s located in a country containing a Trump hotel, or considering a Trump trademark application?\nFrankly, I don’t know. That pesky detail hasn’t been worked out yet.\nBut this one uncertainty doesn’t undermine the overall consistency or clarity of the Trump Doctrine of foreign policy. Its four major principles are firmly rooted either in making money for Trump, or stopping bad people from doing bad things.\nIf Mike Dubke had a clearer grasp of Donald Trump’s worldview, he’d surely see this—as would everyone else."},{"url":"http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/I-just-don-t-call-out-sick-anymore-at-all-New-11192677.php","title":"'I just don't call out sick anymore at all': New report says Walmart punishes employees for taking sick days","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"SFGate","description":"Walmart employees, worker advocacy group A Better Balance issued a report Thursday claiming the retailer has punished its workers for taking sick days and time off to care for loved ones and violated a number of worker-protection laws including the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA).  \"Walmart should fully comply with the law so that no one is illegally punished for a disability-related absence or for taking care of themselves or a loved one with a serious medical condition,\" Dina Bakst, founder and president of A Better Balance, the advocacy group that prepared the report, told the New York Times.

At the end of the clip, Mr. Cowell hit a golden buzzer, sending Ms. Harvey to the show’s next round. Music swelled as Mr. Cowell, known for his grumpy demeanor, joined Ms. Harvey onstage to tell her that her performance “was one of the most amazing things I’ve ever seen and heard.”\nThe clip gained traction online after it aired, and was trending on YouTube on Thursday, where commenters showered Ms. Harvey with accolades.

But on Monday, the Netherlands and Belgium managed to settle a festering territorial problem, without firing a single bullet and with an unlikely spur: a headless corpse.\nIn a signing ceremony attended by their respective royals, Belgium agreed to cede about 35 acres of scenic land by the Meuse River in exchange for about seven acres of land from the Netherlands. The two countries had formalized their border in the Treaty of Maastricht in 1843.\nIn a region that has long known geopolitical and linguistic squabbles, and where Belgium has lived in the shadow of its neighbor, the land swap was anything but inevitable. That apparently is where the headless body comes in.\nThe land belonging to Belgium — equivalent to about 15 soccer fields — is linked to a hard-to-reach peninsula belonging to the Netherlands. In 1961, when the Meuse was reconfigured to aid navigation, it had the side effect of pushing three pieces of land onto the wrong side of the river. According to the Dutch news media, the uninhabited area subsequently gained a reputation for lawlessness, wild parties and prostitution.\nHowever, several years ago, when a couple accidentally stumbled on a headless body and called the Dutch authorities, they were informed that the strip of land was under Belgian jurisdiction. But the Belgian authorities could not get there by land without crossing Dutch territory, which required special permission. The only alternative was a difficult river crossing.\nReferring to the discovery of the body, Jean-François Duchesne, the police commissioner of the Lower Meuse region, told The Associated Press last year that the journey to the area had been arduous.\n“So we had to go there by boat with all that was needed — the prosecutor, the legal doctor, the judicial lab — we had to do round trips over the water,” he said. “It really was not very practical.”\nThe two nations then decided to head off future jurisdictional problems by negotiating a peaceful exchange of parcels of land each country had that were stranded on the wrong bank of the river.\nBelgium’s foreign minister, Didier Reynders, said on Monday that the agreement reflected excellent Belgian-Dutch relations and was proof that “borders can be peacefully changed.”\nA similar agreement gained traction over the summer in Nordic countries, but that hit a snag.\nNorway was considering an unlikely birthday present for neighboring Finland: an Arctic mountain peak on Mount Halti, the highest mountain in Finland, whose 4,478-foot summit is in Norway.\nTo mark the 100th anniversary of Finland’s declaration of independence from Russia, a group of Norwegians was urging the government to move a point on its border with Finland about 490 feet to the north and 650 feet to the east.\nBut that ran afoul of an article of the Norwegian Constitution that states unequivocally that the Kingdom of Norway is “indivisible and inalienable,” and the friendly gesture was called off, at least for now."},{"url":"http://www.npr.org/2017/05/31/528949740/meet-a-home-contractor-who-helps-older-people-age-in-place","title":"Meet A Home Contractor Who Helps Older People Age In Place","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"NPR.org","description":"Leon Watts of Los Angeles has seen his clients' needs change as they've aged. He decided he could do even more for them if he got a master's degree in gerontology.","date":"","full_text":"Leon Watts III stands out among his fellow gerontology students at the University of Southern California's Davis School of Gerontology. They all look to be under 25. Watts is 66. What led up to his return to school was decades spent rehabbing homes in Los Angeles. Over that time, his clients have aged and he's seen their needs change. Watts decided he'd be able to do a lot more for them with a master's degree in gerontology.\nNearly 90 percent of Americans 65 and older say they want to stay in their current homes and communities as they age, according to the AARP. But homes don't keep up with their aging occupants. They don't keep them safe from hard to climb stairs and slippery bathtubs.\nLeon Watts can take care of things like that. And since he's been working with older adults for a long time, he's wasn't shy about giving his classmates some advice on what it takes.\n\"If you're going to be working with seniors,\" he told them, \"you have to be patient enough to listen to their stories and even ask questions about their life.\"\nHis professor, George Shannon, has welcomed these contributions. It's been great having Watts in class, said Shannon, \"because his perspective is so broad.\"\nJust days before his graduation, Watts was dressed in work shoes and a T-shirt that said Guardian Home Services, the name of his business. He was installing an emergency generator outside the home of Lee and Suzanne Chase. They're now both in their late 80s. Their power went out for 24 hours recently. At their age, it's not safe for them to be left in the dark.\nThe Chases have been Watts' clients for more than 30 years. He can walk around their home and point to the many improvements he's made over the decades, like the widening of a driveway and the fencing on the upstairs deck. But now he has some more urgent work to do because recently, Lee had a serious fall. After weeks in the hospital, Chase was allowed to come home only if he got round–the-clock care.\n\"I don't know how long it's going to last,\" Chase said. \"It's a little expensive and I don't have any income anymore.\"\nHe mock-complained that \"between all this medical care and Leon, there's not much left.\" Then he looks at Watts: \"I told you I'd get you,\" he said, as both men laughed.\nThe Chase's home is a traditional two-story with bedrooms upstairs. For now, Lee sleeps in a hospital bed in the dining room. So next on Watts' agenda is a chairlift for the back stairs. But Lee isn't so sure.\n\"I can still go up the front stairs,\" he said, \"and that's good exercise for me.\"\nWell, that chair lift is going in anyway, Suzanne said.\nIt's not just her husband's fall. It's also the bout of pneumonia she had over the winter. \"I felt reeeaally old,\" she said. \"It's a whole new ballgame.\"\nShe and her husband used to think of aging as some vague future they needed to plan for. But now that future has caught up with them. And they'd been counting on remaining in their home \"until we were carried out feet first,\" Suzanne said.\nWatts said that the Chase's situation illustrates the points he wants to get across to all of his clients: do the work on your house before it's an emergency; make a plan for home care before you need it; designate someone to make medical decisions for you, if you can't make them for yourself.\nThis is where his gerontology degree fits in. One of the reasons he went back to school, he said, was to make more contacts with other people interested in gerontology. \"My dream idea is to develop a firm that would have all these different professional people,\" what he calls a \"holistic\" management service for older adults. In his vision, everyone in his firm, whether an accountant or an electrician, would also have a background in gerontology. \"The home modifications and maintenance is just part of it,\" Watts said.\nAs Watts has aged along with his clients, he's gained a deeper appreciation of how much home means when you're older. \"When you can't ski anymore, you don't golf anymore, your friends aren't around anymore, and your kids have grown up and they've gone, the only familiar thing in a person's life is their home.\"\nWatts said that it doesn't matter whether that home is a big old family house like the Chase's or a one-bedroom apartment. That territory is still all yours."},{"url":"http://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/allstate/how-money-traps-victims-of-domestic-violence/750/?utm_source=tl","title":"How Money Traps Victims of Domestic Violence","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"theatlantic.com","description":"The lesser-known crime that keeps perpetrators in charge and helps them continue the abuse","date":"","full_text":"When domestic violence becomes a national conversation, it’s often only after the curtain is pulled back on an otherwise respected, high-profile celebrity. The ensuing uproar makes headlines for a few days, maybe weeks, and then fades back into news-cycle obscurity. But for the millions of victims of domestic abuse—more than one in four women in the U.S., according to the Department of Justice—these headlines ignore a less-visible, longer-lasting damage wrought by their abusers: financial abuse.\nBy blocking or controlling access to financial assets, abusers can coerce their victims into staying with them or coming back if they try to leave, locking them into a cycle of abuse. In fact, “lacking financial knowledge or resources is the number one indicator of whether a domestic violence victim will stay, leave, or return to an abusive relationship,” according to the Allstate Foundation’s Purple Purse, a fundraising and public awareness campaign.\n“Financial abuse, whether you’re talking about ruining her credit, getting her fired or hiding the money, is just as effective in controlling an abuse victim as a lock and key,” Kim Gandy, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, told The Huffington Post.\nFinancial abuse is insidious: It can first appear as a considerate offer to take care of the bills, or a casual request to borrow money. But it escalates until the abuser has full control of every bank account, credit card, and paycheck, which means that even if victims escape, they could have no way to rent a new apartment, find a job, or care for their children.\nUnfortunately, it seems that while the majority of abusers have discovered that truth, the rest of society has yet to catch up. A 2014 survey commissioned by the Allstate Foundation found that while 98 percent of domestic-violence victims also experienced financial abuse, 78 percent of Americans had not heard about financial abuse as it relates to domestic violence.\nThat’s partly because financial abuse is harder to identify than bruises and scars, and less likely to make headlines. But it leaves its victims helpless and without resources for years, both during the abuse and, if the victim can leave, even after it.\nFinancial abusers go as far as ruining their victims’ credit scores by taking out loans in their names, or harassing them at their workplace until they lose their job and their own source of income. Nearly eight million days of paid work are lost to domestic violence every year, according to the Urban Resource Institute. Survivors have recounted being prevented from going to job interviews, or being forbidden to even look at bank statements or bills. And the pure, everyday stress of being trapped in an abusive relationship doesn’t allow much space for financial planning or education.\n“When you’re living in abuse, planning and goal-setting is so foreign to your life,” Jenisee, a survivor of domestic abuse, told the Allstate Foundation. “You need to get through today. You can’t think about what is happening tomorrow, let alone three years from now, five years from now, what’s in your 401k.”\nAs a result, escaping an abusive relationship often means losing financial security as well as the means to regain it. As Nathaniel Fields, president and CEO of the Urban Resource Institute told Forbes, the dilemma often becomes: “Either risk staying in an abusive relationship, or risk becoming homeless and facing poverty.”\nSo for victims who want to become survivors, financial empowerment programs can make the world a little more manageable and financial independence a realistic goal. A 14-month study conducted by the Rutgers University School of Social Work showed that domestic abuse survivors who completed an extensive financial curriculum along with standard domestic-violence services showed significantly improved financial literacy, attitudes, and behaviors than survivors who didn’t go through the curriculum. The women who completed the training also reported feeling safer, freer, and more independent.\nThe Allstate Foundation, along with offering such a curriculum, also provides grants to nonprofits across the country that empower survivors with such tools as job training, financial literacy, and micro-enterprise initiatives. And its awareness efforts, including partnering with Emmy-nominated actress Kerry Washington, are vital to addressing an issue overcast by heavy social stigma: More than three in four Americans believe that media coverage of domestic violence is inadequate.\nAccording to Tom Wilson, Allstate’s chairman and chief executive, it’s incumbent on businesses and employers to lift that stigma and acknowledge that the terrors and consequences of domestic abuse don’t necessarily end when the relationship does. “We need more businesses to step up and play an active role in protecting women,” he wrote in an op-ed on CNN.com, “Wherever possible, businesses should take into account extenuating circumstances such as domestic violence when considering credit histories and ratings.”\nWhen we can finally establish a comprehensive, accessible network of support and resources for survivors of abuse, escaping an abusive relationship will no longer subject victims to poverty, financial insecurity, or persistent fear. If survivors can learn to navigate the labyrinthine financial world independently, the rest of the world may not seem as daunting.\n“Nowadays, there are so many resources available to women,” Michele, a survivor of domestic violence, told the Allstate Foundation. “I would tell somebody nowadays, ‘Don’t waste 10 years of your life like I did. Stand on your feet, empower yourself, find the resources that are out there, and use them.’”"},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-05-17/age-trump-fewer-lenders-want-provide-med-student-student-loans","title":"In the age of Trump, fewer lenders want to provide this med student with student loans","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Public Radio International","description":"Just 160 out of 11,300 applicants were accepted to Loyola’s medical school.

They interviewed about 600 people. About 160 were accepted — the odds of getting in were less than 2 percent.\nAnd 10 of the students they accepted are undocumented, brought to the US as children. They have DACA status, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which gives them a temporary work permit and a chance to become physicians.\nOne of them is Julio Ramos.\nCredit:\nCourtesy of Julio Ramos\nRamos, 24, is a middle school biology teacher in Brownsville, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley. He applied to medical schools last year — becoming a doctor is his lifelong dream — and was accepted to two institutions. Loyola’s Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago was his first choice, but when they called in February, the news was bittersweet.\n“I got a call from Dr. Nakae, who I love. She’s an advocate for social justice and for undocumented students,” says Ramos. He was in.\nBut Dr. Sunny Nakae, assistant dean of admissions and recruitment at Loyola’s medical school, gave him unexpected advice: She suggested he attend Mount Sinai in New York City instead. They could better help him pay for school.\nMost medical students pay for their studies by applying for federal student loans, which DACA recipients are not eligible for. The cost of tuition at Loyola is about $30,000 a semester, and that doesn’t include living expenses.\nIn the past, Loyola has collaborated with private lenders and foundations to help fund their DACA students’ education with loans. As immigration policies shift, the lenders have told the school they can’t be sure their investments will pay off. If the Trump administration ends the DACA program, students like Ramos will no longer have work authorization, which means they could not practice medicine. To lenders, this means they might be unable to repay their loans.\n“They saw these students as investments in underserved communities,” says Mark Kuczewski, chair of the department of medical education at Loyola. “Unless they can be relatively assured that the student will be able to go on and practice and get licensed, which requires the work permit that comes with DACA, it’s hard for these nonprofits to use their community investment funds in this way.”\nSeveral weeks after the first call, Ramos received an email from Loyola reiterating what Nakae had told him.\n“I had to send a personal message to each of our DACA recipients who were accepted in this cycle, letting them know that we currently do not have funding options in place and that they needed to pursue their own private loans and work on assembling their own new packages for this year,” says Nakae. “We would let them defer if they weren’t able to put together the funding.”\nFor the last three years, the school and its partners have provided a combinations of loans and scholarships for seven to 14 undocumented students in each class.\nKuczewski says other medical school usually only accept one or two DACA students through scholarship programs. Loyola has been able to bring in more DACA students by adding private lenders to the mix.\nAlso: College 'dreamers' are unrelenting in fight for immigration reform\nNakae says even medical schools that are able to fund their DACA students through institutional loans, grants or scholarships are concerned about what the Trump administration will do. Students also need to complete a residency — in which a hospital employs them — in order to become licensed physicians. And there are no guarantees hospitals will be willing to do that.\nKuczewski and Nakae are also coming up with a back-up plan to fund their current DACA students, whose loans might be in jeopardy if the Trump administration terminates the program. They are also looking for support for scholarships to help fund newly admitted DACA students.\n“We’re working to explore other options with other foundations and moving more towards a philanthropic type thing rather than a loan-based program,” says Nakae.\nFive of the 10 undocumented students who were admitted to Loyola this year decided to go elsewhere. One partner might be able to help with tuition for two students, says Kuczewski, but the school so far cannot help the others. But he doesn't want the uncertainty to dictate students’ futures.\n“It would be terrible if 10 years from now we looked back and the administration never did anything to the students [who are] DACA recipients, but we all stopped making opportunities,” says Kuczewski.\nIn the meantime, Ramos has decided to attend the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City this fall. The medical school awarded him a combination of loans and scholarships to pay for his medical education. He’ll finish his last year of teaching later this month and then go back to being a student.\nAnd he’s trying to figure out how his undocumented parents can see him at a white coat ceremony this September in New York. It’s a welcome ceremony for first-year students who commit to caring for patients. Ramos’ parents are worried that if they travel past border patrol checkpoints in Texas, they could be detained and deported.\nOne more thing…\nPRI takes a global approach to the news of the day.

Only three of those incidents didn’t involve black or Latinx students, who make up two-thirds of the city’s more than 1 million public school students.\nNYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman told the New York Daily News that police action in school has a big impact on kids’ academic and emotional well-being.\n“When a child is handcuffed, the child is humiliated,” Lieberman said. “It’s incompatible with the safe and supportive learning environment a school is supposed to provide.”\nIn the report, Lieberman emphasized that the use of harsh police tactics in school “is neither necessary nor effective to keep children and staff safe.”\nNYCLU also reported that there were 208 complaints made against school safety officers in 2016 ― 89 for use of force, 15 for abuse of authority, 17 for offensive language and 87 for discourtesy.\nThe Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.\nA representative from the NYPD said in a statement to Fox 5 that very few students are physically restrained, especially if they are emotionally distressed.\n“The NYPD continues to work closely with city schools to reduce arrests and provide a safe learning environment for all students,” the representative said. “Arrests are down 55 percent over [the] past five school years. Summonses issued by the NYPD are down by 81 percent over the past five school years.”\nIn July, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would allocate $47 million annually for “restorative trainings, mental-health programs, and social-emotional supports” as well as other initiatives in public schools.\nDespite the progress that’s been made in reducing school-based arrests in the city, 99 percent is beyond a troubling number. The figure only emphasizes the fact that black and Latinx children, who are disciplined more often and more severely throughout their years in school than white students, face an all too real school-to-prison pipeline. And too often, it puts students’ livelihoods at risk (see: 2015 assault at Spring Valley High School).\nThe NYCLU recommended that New York City move to limit the role of police in school discipline and “operate in a manner consistent with the best interests of children.”\n“Police officers should never handcuff students who don’t pose an immediate safety threat,” NYCLU Advocacy Director Johanna Miller said in the report. “And the NYPD should not treat schools as places to hunt for students they believe committed a crime off of school grounds. Students should never be afraid to go to school.”"},{"url":"http://www.startribune.com/st-paul-schools-taking-less-sexist-view-of-student-dress-codes/423528293","title":"St. Paul schools taking less sexist view of student dress codes","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Star Tribune","description":"New policy for St. Paul schools says rules can be in place, but no one gender can be targeted.","date":"","full_text":"A group giving voice to students in the St. Paul Public Schools is drawing attention to what it sees as the unequal treatment of girls in the enforcement of school dress codes.\nLast week, the school board heeded concerns raised by the SPPS Student Engagement and Advancement Board by amending the district’s dress code policy to prohibit principals from targeting a specific gender when setting dress-code rules for their schools.\nThat is not to say that anything goes.\nThere still will be restrictions, just not with the explicit references — “bosoms, bottoms and bellies,” in the case of an East Side middle school — that the student group said objectifies girls and can hold them to a different standard.\nThe policy change marked another victory for a student group that last year pushed successfully for new accountability measures for school resource officers, or cops in the schools.\nThis year, the 13-member board is composed entirely of girls, but its promotion of dress-code changes reflects not just a collective group opinion, but views expressed by students districtwide in surveys and focus group sessions last fall.\n“We’re not saying there should be no restrictions,” Skyler Kuczaboski, a group member, said last week. “We’re saying that girls should be allowed to be comfortable at their schools.”\nIn a presentation to the school board in December, the student group said that explanations of dress-code violations to girls often focus on their sexuality, which members said can have an alienating effect.\nKuczaboski added that while certain schools require that undergarments not be exposed, she has seen “boys who sag their pants with underwear that outline their butt cheeks, but they don’t get pulled out of class or sent home.”\nShe also spoke of a 6-year-old girl being told to put a sweater over a dress with spaghetti straps even though it was a hot day.\n“The issue was her shoulder, I guess?” Kuczaboski said.\nJackie Turner, the district’s chief operations officer, said principals or their designees still have authority to set standards for cleanliness and neatness.\nShe cited as permissible a set of rules at Linwood Monroe Arts Plus School that dictates the minimum lengths of shorts, skirts and dresses, and requires the covering of undergarments, as long as it “applies to whoever wears undergarments, regardless of gender,” Turner said.\nAs for any school using words like “bosoms, bottoms and bellies” in its dress codes, Turner added: “We will work with [them] to modify their language.”"},{"url":"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2017/0313/No-taxes-for-teachers-California-tries-to-hold-on-to-good-educators","title":"No taxes for teachers: California tries to hold on to good educators","author_text":"The Christian Science Monitor","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Christian Science Monitor","description":"The Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act is a proposal that would incentivize new teachers with tax breaks, and keep veteran teachers in the system by eliminating their income tax entirely.","date":"2017-03-13","full_text":"—A new bill proposed in the California State Senate would completely eliminate income tax for teachers who have been in the profession for six years. Senate Bill 807, also known as the Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act, is an attempt to provide incentives for teachers to stay in the profession in a state troubled by a shortage of educators.\nIn many parts of the United States, teachers continue to face low pay and high burnout rates despite the importance of the profession. The California bill would be the first of its kind in both the state and the country to attempt to incentivize veteran teachers in this way. But while most agree that addressing the problem is important, the idea of using the untested strategy has raised questions as to whether such an expensive program would be effective in addressing the larger issues in the teaching industry.\nThere are a number of reasons for the teacher shortage in California and the rest of the US, says David Steiner, executive director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy in Baltimore.\n\"There is a particular shortage of teachers for children with special needs and for those who speak English as a second language,\" Dr. Steiner tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email. \"The area shortages have multiple causes, but are especially acute in places like San Francisco where the cost of housing is prohibitive for teachers on their salaries.\"\nIn California, high demand and low supply of teachers has resulted in the hiring of many under-qualified teachers and substitutes. Often, current teachers are asked to take on classes outside their fields of expertise.\n\"There are [also] significant concerns about the health and retirement benefits that are being cut from teacher contracts,\" John Craven, a professor of education at the Graduate School of Education at Fordham University in New York, tells the Monitor via email. \"In some states and localities, the employer contributions to retirement packages are negligible. So teachers seeking to contribute to their own retirement packages face an even greater budgetary constraints (as they relate to low salaries). This is particularly true of new teachers.\"\nAll of these problems contribute to the reluctance of potential teachers to commit to the field of education, especially in disadvantaged communities, he adds.\nThe California bill would attempt to rectify the issue by allowing first-time teachers to receive a tax credit amounting to about a 3.4 percent salary increase. Educators that have been teaching for six years or more, however, would see all income tax disappear completely, bumping up their salaries between 4 and 6 percent for the next 10 years.\nAll those tax breaks add up to about $617.5 million annually for the state, not an insignificant figure. But by investing in the new system, lawmakers believe that the program would lower the high turnover rate among teachers and economically benefit the state in the long run.\n\"Teachers are the original job creators,\" said Democratic state Sen. Henry Stern, who introduced the bill along with fellow Democratic Sen. Cathleen Galgiani, in a statement. \"The teaching profession is critical to California’s economic success and impacts every vocation and profession in the state.\"\nMany new teachers in the US burn out quickly, with attrition rates of nearly 8 percent over the past 10 years, according to the Learning Policy Institute. Retirements only account for less than a third of teachers who leave every year. The institute estimates that if attrition rates were brought down to 3 or 4 percent nationally, the US could eliminate teacher shortages altogether.\n\"This is a big and bold idea to deal with the teacher shortage,\" Bill Lucia, president of EdVoice, said in a statement. \"It is not a one-time money spending bill, it's a way to look at the big issue, and the legislature is reacting positively to it.\"\nWhile the Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act's approach is a unique solution to the teacher shortage, it is only one of many approaches put forward over the past few years, says Steiner of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy.\n\"A number of districts have established bonuses for effective teachers (in Washington, D.C., it's $25,000) and some states and/or districts have created career ladders where teachers may earn more for taking on roles such as mentors or curriculum experts,\" says Steiner. \"Some states and/or districts have bonuses for teachers willing to teach in high-needs subjects and/or high-needs schools, and some districts subsidize housing costs.\"\nSuch programs are a start to give teachers what they need in order to teach students more effectively. But in order for truly significant reforms to happen, the public's perspective on teaching needs to change, say Gina Anderson and Rebecca Fredrickson of the Department of Teacher Education at Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas.\nFollow Stories Like This\nSign Up\n\"A cultural paradigm shift is needed in order to change the perception of teaching as a viable career,\" they tell the Monitor in an email. \"Rather than perpetuating the perspective that teachers are martyrs, teachers need to be portrayed as leaders and innovators.\"\n\"The public needs to be informed about the complexities of schools, the diverse makeup and needs of students, and the art and science behind effective teaching,\" they add."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2017/jun/06/liberals-climate-change-trump-paris-accord","title":"Liberals have a responsibility too: make climate change a top issue","author_text":"Jeremy Hance","keywords":["Environment","Climate Change","Climate Change","Science","Trump Administration","Us News","World News","Paris Climate Agreement","Greenhouse Gas Emissions","Energy"],"publication_text":"the Guardian","description":"For too long, liberals have been treating climate change as a third or fourth tier issue.

As an environmental journalist with a lot of left-leaning friends, you can imagine what it looked like: anger, frustration, shock, sadness, another outrage from the world’s most outrageous leader. All of a sudden every one I knew was talking about climate change; I’ll admit it was a nice change of pace, but after nearly ten years of covering climate change I also knew it would be fleeting.\nLiberals have been the champions of climate action for decades, but they’ve largely championed it as an after thought, something that comes near the end of a long to-do list, like the brussels sprouts you conveniently forget to pick up at the grocery store (polling bears this out).

I can see what they’re thinking, “Again, Jeremy, with the climate change?”\nAnd I want to yell: “Yes, again! Again and again and again! Of course, again. Don’t you get that this is a crisis of civilization? Don’t you understand that all your other concerns will be swallowed by this one?” But I’m a polite Midwesterner, so after spouting my two-minute climate piece, haltingly and in eloquently, I let the topic shift to something everyone is more comfortable with like civil rights, health care, or crippling student debt.\nYou see, the GOP has made it too easy for liberals in the US to simply shrug their shoulders and say: it’s their fault we can’t get anything done. And, of course, this is true. In part. Of course, the GOP is world’s only major party that still denies climate change. Of course, the GOP has been corrupted by fossil fuel industries to the extent that they willfully ignore the world’s greatest national security threat.\nBut Obama’s 2010 climate legislation in the US didn’t just fail because the GOP refused to support it. It also failed because Democrats didn’t support it enough, some of the them even openly opposed it. The Democratic Party has been in general timid, conservative, and coy on climate change. Oh, at times their rhetoric has been inspiring, but their actions have no-where near measured up to the what the science demands. They include it in their platform, but rarely prioritize it. Yes, Obama got more done than any other president before – but even during the administration best moments it never felt like the planetary emergency it is.\nLiberals: climate change belongs on it’s own tier above all others, shared perhaps with nuclear war – only climate change is already here and inevitable, future nuclear wars are not.\nBut communicating that to anyone who isn’t required to spend their work days (like me) reading up on the latest climate science is almost impossible. This is not exactly surprising. Psychological research shows that people simply don’t respond to a problem that is viewed as a future-oriented or too big to make a difference (neither of which is true of climate change, but it is often been communicated that way). Sure, we like to watch the civilization collapse on shows like The Walking Dead, but no one likes to confront the possibility that they and their loved ones may one day see a world melting down. Health care feels so much more present (and I get it, I have a precondition and my family wouldn’t have access to insurance without the Affordable Care Act) but for all its importance, health care legislation isn’t going to prevent the collapse of the world as we know it.\nClimate change is the great aggravator. Let me say that again, because it is so important: climate change is the great aggravator. Every single issue that liberals care particular about – whether it is economic inequality, racism, sexism, injustice, war – is going to be made worse by climate change. Climate change will hit people of color, the poor, indigenous, and marginalized communities hardest and first, whether they live on eroding islands or high-rises in the middle of Brooklyn. And, yes, climate change will disproportionately injure women over men. Of course, climate change will also strike what conservatives care about most. The global economy will be absolutely shattered by climate change and national security threats will popup like overheated groundhogs – even the most rich and powerful will not get away unscathed.\nImagine a world with millions of migrants escaping from rising sea waters, with agricultural systems failing and the price of food rising. Imagine a world where every nation suffers from the same water scarcity currently plaguing the Middle East. Imagine a world where hurricanes, rainstorms, wild fires, and blizzards are taking more and more steroids. Imagine a world of mass extinction, where species and entire ecosystems – like coral reefs – vanish from under us. Such impacts will add stressors to every society in the world; they will compound and aggregate.\nWhat happens when a society becomes overstressed? It’s not pretty. Historian Christopher Wickham, has described the period following the end of the Roman Empire as “extreme material simplification”: population declined, technology stagnated, conflicts erupted, the standard of living plummeted and the written record vanished – hence the popular term ‘Dark Ages.’ It’s not just centuries ago: the unimaginable horror and stress of World War I allowed the rise of totalitarianism in both Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Russia.\nIn especially extreme cases, civilization as we know it simply collapses in on itself: witness the mute statues on Easter Island, testament to a conflagration and ecological overreach that is lost to time. Witness the temples of the Mayans overrun by jungle or the multiple societies that rose and fell in South America’s Atacama Desert. But before this happens, extremism, xenophobia, civil war, internecine conflict are the products of a society under extreme stress. When stressors compound, majorities lash out violently. They scapegoat minority groups, whether it’s the Jews or people of color. Law breaks down and the rule of strong over the weak becomes the norm.\nBut even these impacts aren’t some future thing. Climatologists have linked the civil war in Syria in part to water stress exacerbated climate change. Changing rainfall patterns in sub-Saharan Africa are contributing to food crises there, increasing the chances of famine, and you can bet, the possibility of worsening civil and national conflicts, such as what we see in South Sudan. Desertification in the Sahel is resulting in rising extremism. None of this is to say that climate change is solely to blame for any these conflicts or disasters, but you have to be particularly naive to think that a hotter world won’t have violent, destabilizing consequences. The US military has been studying climate-stressed conflict – and performing war games – for decades.\nThe worst thing about climate change won’t be its physical impacts; it will be what it makes us do to each other.\nSo, what can liberals do? First off, if your understanding of climate change is only passing, educate yourself. Some good places to start: here, here and here. Learn too about off-shoots like ocean acidification, deforestation, mass extinction. Next take action: march, protest, divest your money from fossil fuel companies, use public transit, eat less meat (especially beef), trade in for an electric car, put solar panels on your house, buy carbon credits, do something, do many things.\nBut of course the biggest changes need to come not at the personal level, but at the societal one. So, reach out to your representatives, whether liberal or conservative, and tell them: this is a top tier issue. Tell your representative you don’t vote for politicians who aren’t aggressive on climate change. And then make good on that in the ballot box. And if you ever get a call from a pollster who asks what your most important issues are – don’t say the economy or health care. Lead off with climate change. And if they say: oh climate change is not one of the issue their list, then ask them why the hell not?\nFinally, yes, once you feel confidant in your knowledge, then reach out to your liberal, center, and conservative friends or families and open up about climate change. Do it respectfully, be ready to listen – maybe even to some crazy conspiracy theories or really misinformed science – but explain your views and have evidence at hand. Maybe they’ll come around, maybe they won’t – but some research has shown that such one-on-one interactions with loved ones may be the best way to move the dial: candid conversations can change society.\nSo, yes, good on you liberals: you’re on the right side of history and science when it comes to climate change. Pat yourself on the back. But here’s the thing: your kids aren’t really going to care that you believed in climate change, if we don’t stop climate change. They aren’t going to listen to excuses like ‘but it’s the Republicans’ fault’ or ‘but Trump, Trump’. If you continue to view climate change as a lower tier issue, liberals, I guarantee you it will be the only issue for your children and grandchildren. And all those other things you cared so much about will be subsumed in a planet of storms, heat, floods, fires, extremism, xenophobia, injustice, violence, war, death, and suffering. This issue will burn away all the others."},{"url":"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/05/cleveland_was_center_of_spelli.html#incart_river_index","title":"Cleveland girl's spelling victory created racial controversy, national headlines in 1908","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"cleveland.com","description":"A 1908 spelling bee triumph by a black eighth-grade girl from Cleveland upset the day's racial stereotypes and angered the city of New Orleans.","date":"","full_text":"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Seventeen years before the first-ever Scripps National Spelling Bee, a 14-year-old Cleveland girl created headlines -- and racial controversy -- around the world by winning a spelling championship.\nMarie C. Bolden achieved a perfect score in test of more than 100 words as part of the National Education Association's annual meeting in Cleveland. She helped Cleveland's team win first place against eighth-grade teams from all over the country at Cleveland's now defunct Hippodrome theater.\nPittsburgh took second, New Orleans third. And because Marie was black, the event caused furor in New Orleans, which still lived under Jim Crow racial separation laws.\n\"This historical event was planned to foster the better teaching of spelling in school,\" Warren E. Hicks, a former Cleveland assistant school superintendent who ran the event, said in a radio interview at the time. \"But it resulted in more than that. It demonstrated again that in our schools, every boy and every girl has a fair and even chance.\"\nThe 2017 Scripps championship spelling bee begins Wednesday outside Washington D.C., with 291 spellers who won local competitions sponsored by newspapers.\nThe Plain Dealer/cleveland.com spelling bee featured some tough competition at Cuyahoga Community College's Metro campus today, and Mia Ashriem, 14, of Brook Park, spelled her way to a shot at national competition.\nIn 1908, NEA organizers invited the nation's cities to send eighth-grade teams to participate in a spelling bee at its convention, according to a radio interview conducted with Hicks. Thirty-four cities did so, including Boston, Buffalo, Cincinnati, New Orleans and Pittsburgh.\nHicks said that when the New Orleans team learned Cleveland's team included Bolden, it threatened to leave the competition. Hicks said Cleveland Superintendent William Harris Elson wouldn't comply with New Orleans' request to remove Bolden from the team.\n\"He said she had won her place in a fair and open contest,\" Hicks said in the radio interview. \"He telegraphed New Orleans, and the next day, a telegram came saying they would stay and spell, and they did.\"\nOn June 29, 1908, 510 children from all over the country ascended the Hippodrome stage. First, they took a 100-word written spelling test. As each word was pronounced, a telegraph broadcast it around the world. After the written tests were graded, each speller took to the stage to spell four words aloud in front of an audience.\nAt the end of the day, Marie was declared the competition's individual winner after spelling all words correctly. Cleveland was declared the winning team, because its competitors missed 3 words on average. Pittsburgh came in second, missing an average of 4 words, and New Orleans was third, missing 5 words on average, Hicks said.\n\"The little girl was congratulated by hundreds, even members of the New Orleans spelling team shaking her hand when President Francis H. Haserot of the Cleveland Board of Education pinned to her dress the gold medal which denotes the championship of American public school spellers,\" said an account in the Omaha Daily Bee newspaper.\nBooker T. Washington lauded Marie in his speech the following day.\n\"I think that you will admit we spell out of the same spelling book that you do,\" he said, according to the book, \"How Do You Spell Ruzevelt: A History of Spelling in America.\" \"And I think you will also admit that we spell a little better.\"\nIn a Plain Dealer interview, Marie, whose father was a letter carrier and whose mother ran a senior citizen home, said she studied hard for the contest with help from her parents and friends. She said she wanted to win \"because it was Cleveland against the other cities, and because my father and mother wanted me to.\"\n\"When I felt nervous at the Hippodrome, it steadied me to think of these things,\" she said. \"I just kind of gritted my teeth and made up my mind that I wouldn't miss a word.\"\nMarie's victory made national news because it upset the day's stereotypes about what black children could accomplish.\nRepercussions were most serious in New Orleans, where the city's school board censured its superintendent for letting the team participate, according to a contemporary account in the Seattle Republican newspaper.\nWhen a group of black educators in New Orleans wanted to hold a spelling bee in Bolden's honor, the city's mayor \"withheld a permit for the affair on the ground that it might prove an incentive to a race riot with consequences dreadful to New Orleans,\" said another account in the Capital newspaper from Mitchell, South Dakota.\nThe Louisiana spellers were perhaps held back \"by the excitement of their clash with race prejudice in the Northern city,\" the New Orleans Picayune speculated, according to nola.com. The district's superintendent, who \"did not care to talk about\" the episode the day of the bee, the paper said, figured the New Orleanians had not done their best because they were \"too far away from home, in a strange land to them,\" with a large crowd in attendance.\nMarie lost her formal title after it emerged the professor who announced the written test's spelling words gave the wrong definition for the word \"capitol,\" which altered results. The change gave two other Cleveland girls perfect scores, and left the championship in the city's hands. But Marie kept her medal despite the change and acclaim for her continued.\nHicks said that Marie and her mother visited his office the next January, and opened a large satchel.\n\"There were tokens in gold and sliver and ivory and wood from the rulers and chiefs of tribes of Africa,\" he recalled in the radio interview. \"And we kept that exhibit in school headquarters for many weeks that our boys and girls and teachers might see it.\"\nHicks wrote a book about spelling that described the teaching methods that led to Cleveland's victory. He ended up moving to Wisconsin, where he became a state education official and died in 1967 at age 101.\nHis great-granddaughter - journalist Jamie Stiehm - learned of the Cleveland imbroglio after his death, when she found a speech Hicks delivered on the subject. She and her sister researched the incident and wrote a screenplay about it that was never produced.\nStiehm tracked down a granddaughter of Marie's who said Marie moved to Canada, married, and led a quiet life.\n\"By winning the whole spelling bee, she made an incredible statement,\" said Stiehm. \"It was about much more than spelling in the end.\"\nPlain Dealer news researcher Jo Ellen Corrigan contributed to this report.\nPlease take a moment and click here to help the Greater Cleveland Food Bank, a cleveland.com partner.

Rick Snyder's administration and sparking a constitutional conflict.\nThe state Senate this past week unanimously voted to issue more grants from the popular Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund than recommended, a break from what is typically a rubber-stamp process. And in a closer vote, the Republican-controlled chamber approved new rules for how the money is spent each year — requiring, for example, that 25 percent be used for development projects instead of the current mandate that no more than 25 percent go toward recreation facilities.\nThe fund consists of royalties paid by oil and gas development companies that buy and lease state-owned mineral rights. Used exclusively to purchase and improve land for public recreation and protection of natural features, it has awarded more than $1 billion for trails, parks, boat launches and other projects in every county over its 41-year history — including Belle Isle and the Department of Natural Resources Outdoor Adventure Center in Detroit, and swaths of land in the Upper Peninsula.\nMore on Freep.com:\nThe fund has accumulated a maximum $500 million in principal, so royalties now go to the Michigan State Parks Endowment Fund. But interest and earnings on the $500 million is still used for land and recreation projects every year.\nLegislators are frustrated that the Natural Resources Trust Fund board is not spending more of the money above the cap.\nInstead of allocating $47.6 million for 27 acquisitions and 87 development projects per the request, the Senate added $7.7 million for another 43 recreational projects for which applications were submitted — many of them at parks and trails. Projects include splash pads in South Haven and Gibraltar, beach improvements in Lake Odessa and a mountain bike park in Munising.\n\"I think the (GOP) caucus and the Senate all agree that they ought to go in this. They have the money. We're doing it,\" said Sen. Darwin Booher, an Evart Republican who is sponsoring the legislation. \"This is oil and gas money that belongs to all the people. Use it. That's what it's for.\"\nThe fund would have at least $580 million after this year's grants are issued.\nThe state Department of Natural Resources — whose director sits on the trust fund's five-member board — opposes the bills, calling them unconstitutional. The agency has asked Attorney General Bill Schuette for a legal opinion.\n\"It's very clear in the constitution that the trust fund board makes the recommendations on which projects should be funded. And because they didn't recommend all of the projects to be funded, then the Legislature really didn't have the authority to add projects,\" said Steve DeBrabander, who manages the DNR's grants section. \"While we're all for public outdoor recreation, we do have a process that's been very successful, that's very accountable and we believe follows the constitution.\"\nThe legislation will next be considered by the GOP-led House.\nAdministration officials are concerned about a number of proposed changes in a bill that won approval 24-14, with all 11 Democrats and three Republicans opposed. One change would ensure that a quarter of yearly spending goes for recreation projects, a revision to a provision that says up to a quarter must be used for that purpose.\nAlso on Freep.com:\nThe board should have flexibility if there is a \"once-in-a-time, incredible\" opportunity to buy land for the public, DeBrabander said.\nHe also criticized provisions that would permanently let lawmakers add more projects than recommended — as long as they have been scored by the board — and give local governments their grants upfront instead of reimbursing them gradually.\nEnvironmentalists said the bills would \"politicize\" a nonpartisan process.\nThe Michigan Environmental Council cited a provision that would require the state to apply for and be rejected for trust funds before it could use other funds for outdoor recreation projects. Another would let the state use trust funds to buy land previously acquired with federal money.\n\"Wasting trust fund dollars on land already in public hands would be fiscally irresponsible and contrary to the fund's purpose, which is to expand and improve opportunities for Michigan residents to enjoy the outdoors,\" President Chris Kolb said in a statement. \"It's one of many provisions in this bill that just don't make much sense and raise a fundamental question: Why are lawmakers messing with a system that has worked remarkably well for more than 40 years?\"\nBut top Republicans defended the legislation.\n\"The constitution is very clear — that the Legislature shall provide by law for the implementation of the Natural Resources Trust Fund,\" said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Hildenbrand of Lowell. \"Many members of the Legislature want to ensure the trust fund process is working in a transparent and efficient manner, and that we are utilizing and leveraging the trust fund resources to the best of our ability.\"\nOnline:"},{"url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40042581","title":"Google AI defeats human Go champion - BBC News","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"BBC News","description":"Chinese Go player Ke Jie has lost two games of Go to Google's artificial intelligence.","date":"","full_text":"Google's DeepMind AlphaGo artificial intelligence has defeated the world's number one Go player Ke Jie.\nAlphaGo secured the victory after winning the second game in a three-part match.\nDeepMind founder Demis Hassabis said Ke Jie had played \"perfectly\" and \"pushed AlphaGo right to the limit\".\nFollowing the defeat, Ke Jie told reporters: \"I'm a little bit sad, it's a bit of a regret because I think I played pretty well.\"\nIn Go, players take turns placing stones on a 19-by-19 grid, competing to take control of the most territory.\nIt is considered to be one of the world's most complex games, and is much more challenging for computers than chess.\nTea-making\nAlphaGo has built up its expertise by studying older matches and playing thousands of games against itself.\nThe company says the eventual plan is to deploy its artificial intelligence \"in areas of medicine and science\".\nProf Noel Sharkey, a computer scientist at Sheffield University, said it is still a long way from creating a general intelligence.\n\"It is an incredible achievement and most experts thought an AI winning at Go was 20 years away so DeepMind is leading the field but this AI doesn't have general intelligence.

It had military installations and was regularly used as a Hollywood set. But when Michael Tubbs grew up there in the 1990s, gunshots whizzed in the streets and more than half of the city’s high schoolers dropped out before graduation.\nTubbs was raised by his mother, who had him at 16. In a high-school essay, Tubbs describes meeting his father for the first time at the age of 12. He was in chains and dressed in an orange jumpsuit at the Kern County Prison. “Why are you here,” Tubbs recalls asking.\nHis dad responded: “Prison is your destiny. From birth you are set up to fail. …You’re a black man in America, and it’s either prison or death.”\nHis father’s words have never left him. They settled in his core and drive his ambition.\nIn less than two decades he’s graduated from Stanford, captured Oprah Winfrey’s attention and worked at Google. Once a White House intern, he’s also famously set his sights on the presidency. In 2008, during Barack Obama’s first presidential bid, Tubbs met the then Illinois senator and recalls: “I looked at him, shook his hand and told him, ‘I’m next.’” Obama reportedly said, “Okay.”\nYou're a black man in America, and it's either prison or death.\"\nMichael Tubbs's father\nBut for now, Tubbs is focused on his Californian city. The goals he’s set for himself as mayor are lofty: Lowering unemployment (8.3 percent in February 2017), raising graduation rates (82.6 percent in 2015), lowering violent crime (25 instances of murder between January and June 2016) and attracting a major philanthropic investment, like the $816 million Detroit received from the Ford Foundation and other donors to save its art museum.\n“I’m tired of talking about where we’ve been. I’m more interested in talking about where we’re going,” Tubbs said at his victory party, “We have to mature as a community and start demanding solutions.”\nBut finding them will require deft political skill. The average Stockton resident earns $19,900 annually, yet the city has little ability to provide revitalizing social services, considering it’s still recovering after declaring bankruptcy in 2012.\nTubbs’s approach to government taps an innovation-based strategy much like the tech campuses in nearby Silicon Valley. He pilots small projects and relentlessly studies the data to determine what’s most effective for the lowest cost. He’s also investing in long-term fixes — rather than short-term patches that drained city coffers — so that the kids born today will have more opportunity than he did.\n“I would say I’m solution-oriented. I don’t want to know how this can’t happen. Tell me how it can,” Tubbs says.\nSome of his earliest efforts — ones he helped initiate as a Stockton city council member — have established Tubbs reputation as so-called “doer.” He closed liquor stores in South Stockton, opened a health clinic and worked with young people on community cleanup projects.\nAs mayor, however, he faces inherent challenges that come with the implementation of his early projects. For example, as a council member, Tubbs was a key advocate for distributing body cameras to Stockton’s police officers as a way of raising accountability. In August 2016 (prior to Tubbs’s mayoral election), a 30-year-old man named Colby Friday was killed in an officer-involved shooting. An officer’s body camera failed to capture the incident because it was not activated. A nearby security camera did record the event, and the district attorney has agreed to share that footage with Friday’s family.\nIn another incident, when Black Lives Matter protesters interrupted a city council meeting in February, Tubbs announced a five-minute break and abruptly left the podium, angering his one-time supporters. A month later, he tells NationSwell his number-one rule about politics: “It takes thick skin.”\nDuring his 2016 run for mayor, Tubbs built his campaign around the idea of creating opportunities and stability for the people of Stockton. And it worked. He beat his opponent, Republican Anthony Silva, by almost 40 points.\nTubbs credits the young interns who canvassed and phoned banked for him with drumming up civic engagement in the city. In contrast to many of Tubbs’s childhood peers, these teens are some of the loudest voices in the ears of Stockton’s elected officials.\n“My phone does not stop ringing, because the young people we’ve trained expect more from their elected officials,” says Lange Luntao, a Stockton school board member.\nMichael Tubbs and his friends grew up believing they needed to leave Stockton to find opportunity and a better life. Once gone, few ever felt the need to return. Already, Tubbs is inspiring more of his young constituents to stay. With time, perhaps others from his own generation will return.\nEditors’ note: A previous version of this article stated that the Colby Friday incident was reportedly captured on a police officer body camera.

Board of Education led a life you would dream about. He died last month.","date":"2017-04-27","full_text":"When I first considered joining Dilworth Paxson’s leadership team a few years ago, my thoughts immediately went to the unique legacy of the firm. Richardson Dilworth, as iconic a Philadelphian as any in the past 100 years, gave his name not only to the partnership but to the plaza that serves as the public gateway to City Hall. The firm’s catalogue of marquee matters reads like a timeline of the civic evolution of our city, where figures such as Kohn, Kalish, Harmelin and Jacovini loom Rushmore-like over Philadelphia’s legal landscape.\nAmong these great luminaries who have plied their trade at Dilworth over the years was one whose light shone perhaps the brightest and farthest: Bill Coleman.\nBill Coleman was a rare and inspiring figure who devoted his own ambition and his own propensity for hard work not just to making his own good luck, but to making life better for his fellow Americans, both in his own time and for generations to follow.\nIn the days following his death at the age of 96 late last month, reverent obituaries of William Thaddeus Coleman Jr. flooded the local and national media. Invariably, these recited the many estimable highlights of his long career in the law: graduating first in his class from Harvard Law after serving in the Army Air Corps during World War II; serving as the first black U.S. Supreme Court clerk under Justice Felix Frankfurter; working as a staff attorney on the Warren Commission; becoming the second black Cabinet member when he was appointed Secretary of Transportation by Gerald Ford; and perhaps most famously, drafting key plaintiff’s briefs in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case (while at Dilworth Paxson).‎\nAs a lawyer in private practice, Coleman was known as a brilliant and indefatigable litigator, a trusted and sought-after corporate board member, and to his junior colleagues, a tough and demanding boss. When Coleman joined the firm, Dilworth Paxson already had a reputation for excellence. He burnished that reputation by demanding perfection.\nColeman achieved a career of unparalleled distinction, and, in the words of my Dilworth partner Steve Harmelin, “led a life that you would dream about.” But for all his talent, intelligence and tenacity, Coleman faced the same kind of prejudice that derailed the careers and lives of so many black men of his generation. As a student at Germantown High School, the swim team disbanded rather than let him join it. After he graduated from Harvard Law and completed his clerkship with Justice Frankfurter, he couldn’t find work at a major Philadelphia law firm until Dilworth offered him a job.\nThose injustices and humiliations may have shaped Coleman’s worldview, but they never made him a cynic. Instead, those experiences motivated him to apply his formidable intelligence and legal education to reshape society by changing the law. To paraphrase a quote often invoked by another African American trailblazer, Coleman helped to bend the moral arc of the universe toward justice.\nCountless minority citizens saw the prospects of their lives measurably improved thanks to Coleman’s pioneering work in civil rights law, and not just as a result of Brown v. Board of Education.\nCountless minority citizens saw the prospects of their lives measurably improved thanks to Coleman’s pioneering work in civil rights law, and not just as a result of Brown v. Board of Education; he also played instrumental roles in cases seeking to overturn anti-miscegenation statutes and end discrimination in educational institutions. Whether arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court, which he did 19 times, or serving as president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which he chaired from 1977 to 1997, Coleman’s achievements and influence simply cannot be overstated.\nI am a person of color and an immigrant, and as proud as I am to be the first Indian chairman of a major law firm, none of those are among the first characteristics I would use to describe myself. I like to believe that whatever success I’ve achieved in my life reflects the rich collage of interactions and collaborations I’ve undertaken with the many visionaries whose paths I’ve been fortunate to cross. Truth be told, I’ve spent more time in the company of entrepreneurs and business leaders than with champions of the marginalized. But the undeniable fact is that Coleman (who, it must be mentioned, was both a champion of the marginalized and a highly successful business leader), blazed the trail that I and so many others walk today.\nBill Coleman was a rare and inspiring figure who devoted his own ambition and his own propensity for hard work not just to making his own good luck, but to making life better for his fellow Americans, both in his own time and for generations to follow.\nAjay Raju, CEO and Chairman of Dilworth Paxson, is co-founder of The Citizen."},{"url":"http://www.pewforum.org/2017/04/26/in-america-does-more-education-equal-less-religion","title":"In America, Does More Education Equal Less Religion?","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Pew Research Center's Religion \u0026 Public Life Project","description":"Overall, U.S. adults with college degrees are less religious than others on some measures.

On the other hand, Americans with college degrees report attending religious services as often as Americans with less education.\nThis analysis looks at measures of religious identification and commitment among Americans with different levels of education. Pew Research Center has previously published data from the opposite perspective, looking at levels of education among people in different religious groups. In the U.S., Hindus and Jews are among the most highly educated religious groups. Worldwide, Jews have the most years of formal schooling.\nMoreover, the majority of American adults (71%) identify as Christians. And among Christians, those with higher levels of education appear to be just as religious as those with less schooling, on average. In fact, highly educated Christians are more likely than less-educated Christians to say they are weekly churchgoers. 2\nLooking at the U.S. public as a whole, however, the answer to the question of whether more education is correlated with less religion appears to be yes. Among all U.S. adults, college graduates are considerably less likely than those who have less education to say religion is “very important” in their lives: Fewer than half of college graduates (46%) say this, compared with nearly six-in-ten of those with no more than a high school education (58%).\nHighly educated Americans also are less inclined than others to say they believe in God with absolute certainty and to pray on a daily basis. And, when asked about their religious identity, college graduates are more likely than others to describe themselves as atheists or agnostics (11% of college grads vs. 4% of U.S. adults with a high school education or less).\nAt the same time, Americans with college degrees are no less likely than others to report attending religious services on a weekly basis. Roughly a third of U.S. adults with college degrees (36%) say they attend a house of worship at least weekly, about the same as the share of those with some college (34%) and those with a high school diploma or less education (37%) who say they attend services once a week or more.\nAnd while college graduates are more likely than others to describe themselves as atheists or agnostics and less likely to identify with Christianity (64% describe themselves as Christians, compared with 71% of those with some college education and 75% of those with a high school degree or less), they are not, on the whole, much less likely than others to identify with any religion. Indeed, fully three-quarters of college graduates are affiliated with some religion (including 11% who say they are adherents of non-Christian faiths like Judaism, Hinduism, Islam and Buddhism), as are 76% of those with some college experience and 78% of those whose education topped out with high school.\nIn addition, among those who do identify as Christians, college graduates tend to be about as religiously observant as those with less education – and in some cases more so. For instance, more than half of college-educated Christians say they attend religious services on a weekly basis (52%), compared with 45% of Christians with some college experience and 46% of Christians with a high school degree or less.\nOverall, 70% of Christians with college degrees have a high level of religious commitment on a scale incorporating four common measures of religious observance (worship attendance, frequency of prayer, belief in God and the self-described importance of religion in one’s life), as do 73% of those with some college and 71% of those with no college experience. 3\nThere could be many possible reasons for these patterns, though such explanations are outside the scope of this report. This analysis does not attempt to explain why, for example, Americans with more education are less likely to express belief in God. Nor does it try to explain why college-educated Christians appear to go to church more often than less-educated Christians. The focus here is simply on describing the patterns found in recent Pew Research Center polling, particularly the very large U.S. Religious Landscape Study, which involved interviews with more than 35,000 Americans reached on randomly dialed cellphones and landlines.\nFor ease of presentation, this analysis generally uses three categories of educational attainment, dividing U.S. adults into those who have a college degree, those who have some college (including those with an associate’s degree and those with some community college experience), and those who have only a high school diploma or less (including those with no high school diploma and those who never reached high school).\nThe broad patterns are largely the same if the number of educational categories is expanded, for example, by separating Americans who hold postgraduate degrees from those with just bachelor’s degrees, or by separating those who have not completed high school from those who have a high school diploma but no college experience. In fact, those at the lowest end of the educational spectrum (i.e., people who did not finish high school) stand out for especially high levels of religious observance by some measures, such as the self-described importance of religion in their lives, further supporting the idea that more education is connected with lower levels of religiosity among the U.S. public overall. (For more detail, see the detailed tables at the end of this report.)\nFurthermore, the links between education and religion reported here generally persist in more sophisticated modeling even when other factors that might influence religious belief and practice – such as gender, race, age and religious tradition – are taken into account.\nReligion and education within Christian traditions: Highly educated are generally at least as observant as those with less education\nThe tendency for Christian college graduates to exhibit rates of religious observance that are at least on par with their less highly educated counterparts is evident across a variety of Christian traditions. Among evangelical Protestants, for instance, 87% of college graduates are highly religious, according to the four-item index of religious commitment, as are 83% of those with some college and 82% of evangelicals with a high school diploma or less schooling.\nCatholics are, on the whole, less religiously observant than evangelicals. But here again, college-educated Catholics exhibit a similar overall level of religiosity (62% highly religious) as Catholics with less education (61% among those with some college, 60% among Catholics with only a high school education).\nAmong Mormons, those who are more highly educated are not simply as religious as those with less education – Mormons with college experience are more religiously observant, on average, than Mormons with less education. Fully 92% of college-educated Mormons are highly religious, as are 91% of Mormons with some college. Among Mormons whose education topped out with high school, however, just 78% score high on the index of religious observance.\nThe propensity for highly educated Christians to exhibit relatively high levels of religious observance is most pronounced with respect to religious attendance. Indeed, across all five of the nation’s largest Christian traditions, college graduates are significantly more likely than their counterparts with less education to say they attend religious services regularly. Among mainline Protestants, for instance, 36% of college graduates say they attend religious services on a weekly basis, compared with 31% of mainline Protestants who have not completed college. And among those in the historically black Protestant tradition, 59% of college graduates say they attend church weekly, compared with 53% of those with some college and 52% of those with only a high school education.4\nOn other measures of religious observance, college-educated Christians tend to look quite similar to those who haven’t completed college. There are, however, a few exceptions. Among mainline Protestants and Catholics, for instance, those with higher levels of education are slightly less likely to say religion is very important in their lives. And college-educated mainline Protestants are less likely than mainline Protestants who have less formal education to say they believe in God with absolute certainty.\nReligion and education among religious ‘nones’ and Jews: Most highly educated are least religious\nWhile college-educated Christians are about as observant – and sometimes more observant –than Christians with less education, the data show that among the religiously unaffiliated (i.e., those who describe their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular”), those who have college degrees are considerably less religious than “nones” without a college education.\nFor example, just over a third of religious “nones” who have a high school diploma or less schooling say they believe in God with absolute certainty (36%), compared with just 15% of religiously unaffiliated adults who have completed college. One-quarter of “nones” whose education topped out with high school say they pray every day, which is double the share of college-educated “nones” who say they pray daily (12%). And while 20% of religiously unaffiliated adults with no college experience say religion is very important in their lives, only 6% of college-educated “nones” say the same.\nAs with the religiously unaffiliated, highly educated Jews tend to be less religious than Jews with fewer years of schooling. For instance, Pew Research Center’s 2013 survey of U.S. Jews found that while more than half of Jews who have not completed college say they believe in God with absolute certainty (54%), only about three-in-ten Jewish college graduates say the same (28%). 5 And while about four-in-ten Jews who have not completed college say religion is very important in their lives (39%), only a quarter of Jewish college graduates say religion is very important to them (25%). 6\nThese differences are driven partly by Orthodox Jews, who tend to be much more religiously observant and less educated (in terms of number of years of secular schooling) than non-Orthodox Jews. However, even when the analysis is restricted to the non-Orthodox, Jews with college degrees are less likely to say religion is very important to them or that they believe in God with absolute certainty compared with Jews with lower levels of educational attainment.\nReligion and education among Muslims\nThere is no clear pattern when it comes to the relationship between religion and education for U.S. Muslims. 7 According to a 2011 Pew Research Center survey of Muslim Americans, Muslims with a college education and those with no more than a high school education attend mosque and pray at about equal rates: Roughly half of Muslims in both of these educational groups attend services at least once a week, while two-thirds pray some or all of the five salah (Islamic prayers) each day. Nearly all Muslim Americans in each educational category (95% each) say they believe in God. 8\nAlthough U.S. Hindus, Buddhists and other, smaller religious groups are studied in Pew Research Center surveys, including the 2014 Religious Landscape Study, they are not analyzed in this report, for a variety of methodological reasons. Interviews for the Landscape Study were conducted in English and Spanish, effectively excluding members of these religious traditions who speak only Asian languages. Pew Research Center’s 2012 survey of Asian Americans did include interviews in seven Asian languages, but the survey excluded respondents who did not identify as Asian American. Since a considerable share of U.S. Buddhists are not Asian Americans, the Asian Americans study is not able to provide information on the full population of U.S. Buddhists. Hindus are not included in this analysis of religion and education because the vast majority of Hindus in the U.S. have college degrees, and neither the Asian Americans study nor the Religious Landscape Study included enough interviews with Hindus who do not have college degrees to compare U.S. Hindus with different levels of education.\nThe idea that religion declines as average levels of education increase in societies is one of the key components of secularization theory. For one example of a scholar questioning this theory, however, see Schwadel, Philip. 2011. “The Effects of Education on Americans’ Religious Practices, Beliefs and Affiliations.” Review of Religious Research. ↩\nIn addition to attendance at religious services, education is also linked with higher levels of involvement in secular organizations. See, for example:\nSchwadel, Philip. 2011. “The Effects of Education on Americans’ Religious Practices, Beliefs and Affiliations.” Review of Religious Research.\nVerba, Sidney, Kay Lehman Scholzman and Henry E. Brady. 1995. “Voice and Equality: Civic Voluntarism in American Politics.”\nMueller, Charles W., and Weldon T. Johnson. 1975. “Socioeconomic Status and Religious Participation.” American Sociological Review.\nGoode, Erich. 1966. “Social Class and Church Participation.” American Journal of Sociology.\nDemerath, N. J. III. 1965. “Social Class in American Protestantism.” ↩\nThe index is created by combining four individual measures of religious observance – self-assessment of religion’s importance in one’s life, religious attendance, frequency of prayer and belief in God. Respondents are assigned a score of 1 on each of the four measures on which they exhibit a high level of religious observance, a score of 0 on each of the measures on which they exhibit a medium level of religious observance, and a score of -1 on each measure on which they exhibit a low level of religious observance.\nHigh religious observance is defined as saying religion is very important in one’s life, attending religious services at least once a week, praying at least once a day, and believing in God with absolute certainty. Medium religious observance is defined as saying religion is somewhat important in one’s life, attending religious services once or twice a month or a few times a year, praying between a few times a week and a few times a month, and believing in God with less than absolute certainty. Respondents are also assigned a medium score on any questions they declined to answer. Low religious observance is defined as saying that religion is “not too” or “not at all” important in one’s life, seldom or never attending religious services, seldom or never praying, and saying that one does not believe in God.\nThe scores for each of these four individual items are then summed; respondents who score a 2 or higher are categorized as “high” on the scale (i.e. they are “highly religious”), those who score between -1 and 1 are categorized as “medium” on the scale, and those scoring -2 and below are categorized as “low” on the scale.\nCronbach’s alpha for the scale is 0.851 and is not improved if any variable is deleted from the scale. ↩\nSurveys that ask respondents how often they attend religious services typically obtain higher estimates of rates of weekly attendance than other, more indirect methods of data collection (such as asking respondents to keep a diary of how they spend their days, without specific reference to attendance at worship services). When prompted by a survey question to report how often they attend religious services, respondents who say they attend every week may be indicating that they see themselves as the kind of people who regularly go to services, rather than that they never miss a week of church. For a discussion of differences between self-reported attendance and actual attendance rates, see Brenner, Philip S. 2011. “Exceptional Behavior or Exceptional Identity? Overreporting of Church Attendance in the U.S.” Public Opinion Quarterly. Though this body of research suggests that attendance measures from surveys may not necessarily be the best gauge of the share of people who attend services in any given week, knowing whether respondents think of themselves as regular churchgoers is nevertheless very important because this measure of religious commitment often is correlated with other religious beliefs and practices, as well as with social and political attitudes. In addition to the overreporting of church attendance that arises from asking respondents directly how often they attend religious services, readers should bear in mind that telephone opinion surveys can produce overestimates of religious attendance due to high rates of nonresponse. See, for example, Pew Research Center’s 2012 report “Assessing the Representativeness of Public Opinion Surveys” and Pew Research Center’s July 21, 2015, Fact Tank post “The challenges of polling when fewer people are available to be polled.” ↩\nThis analysis is based on Jews by religion, or people who say their religion is Jewish and do not profess any other religion. See Pew Research Center’s 2013 survey of U.S. Jews for more information. ↩\nPew Research Center’s 2013 survey of U.S. Jews did not ask respondents about self-reported frequency of prayer. Therefore, the religiosity index, which uses frequency of prayer as one of the four measures in the index, cannot be created for U.S. Jews using this survey. ↩\nThe religious commitment scale was not created for Muslims for two reasons. First, Pew Research Center’s 2011 survey of U.S. Muslims did not ask respondents about the certainty of their belief in God, which is one of the four elements that make up the religiosity scale. Second, expectations about attendance at mosque differ widely by gender (traditionally, attendance is normative for Muslim men, but less so for women), which complicates comparisons between Muslims and many Christians groups on the scale. ↩\nPew Research Center’s 2011 survey of U.S. Muslims asked respondents: “Do you believe in One God, Allah, or not?” The survey did not ask the follow-up question about certainty of this belief. ↩\nThis report is a collaborative effort based on the input and analysis of the following individuals.

In 1999, it was also difficult to tell that the lake had once been so polluted that, on hot summer days, families would roll up car windows as they drove by to block the stench coming from the water. Lax environmental protections had allowed decades of industrial pollution and municipal sewage to flow into the lake. By the 1940s, no one could swim in the water and the amusement parks, the Syracuse Yacht Club and resorts had all shut down. The lake was awash in bacteria and algae.\nToday, as an aquatic ecologist with 18 years of research on freshwater under my belt, I know firsthand why this history of Onondaga Lake — once the most polluted lake in the U.S. — matters. The lake warns us of the tremendous costs of not having strong environmental protections in place — ecological costs as well as staggering economic costs. We can do incredible damage to bodies of water in very short periods of time. Cleaning them, on the other hand, takes decades and billions of dollars.\nIt is unfortunate that warnings such as the one Onondaga Lake offers are not being heeded by some officials. In February, 54 U.S. senators and 228 representatives voted to rescind the Stream Protection Rule. Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida has introduced a bill to terminate the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, with co-sponsors from Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Texas and West Virginia. Scott Pruitt, the new head of the EPA, has sued the agency 14 times, including to block a rule that restricts how much mercury can be emitted by power plants. Emails released in February show that when Pruitt was Oklahoma’s attorney general he worked very closely with industry to try to weaken federal environmental protections. And the White House’s budget proposal includes devastating cuts to the EPA.\nIn many ways, the story of Onondaga Lake is a success story, giving us hope that, with effort, polluted waters can recover. But it is an extremely costly success story.\nOnondaga Lake shows us what happens when we do not have sufficient environmental protection. Wastewater deposited tons of mercury in the lake, and 80-foot-tall waste beds on the shores leached other contaminants such as benzene, toluene, PCBs and cadmium into the lake. Raw and partially treated sewage with nutrient levels 100 times regulatory limits regularly flowed into Onondaga. Most of the fish species died, and the remaining fish had mercury levels too high for safe consumption, even 20 years after fishing was first banned and cleanup efforts began.\nAfter his confirmation, Pruitt tweeted that he is dedicated to working with stakeholders — who he then defined as “industry, farmers, ranchers, business owners” — on environmental stewardship. Onondaga Lake (not to mention the residents of Flint, Michigan, who are still unable to drink tap water due to lead contamination) shows us that we are all stakeholders when it comes to the environment, and that we all deal with the damage that accompanies environmental pollution.\nThanks to 1972’s Clean Water Act, actions forced by a series of lawsuits in the 1970s and ’80s, and the lake and surrounding areas being named a Superfund site in 1994, Onondaga Lake began to recover. Changes have been dramatic. People no longer need to roll up their windows when they drive by. Now, instead of just 9 to 12 fish species, the lake is home to 65. There’s even hope that swimmers might return to the lake in the next few years.\nNo one wants to deal with excessive regulation. But no one wants their favorite fishing site polluted, their swimming beach closed or their drinking water compromised.\nBut this recovery came at an enormous cost. The bill for the cleanup alone was over US$1 billion. And there also have been incalculable costs associated with damage to the ecosystem and lost recreational opportunities.\nIn many ways, the story of Onondaga Lake is a success story, giving us hope that, with effort, polluted waters can recover. But it is an extremely costly success story. When we remove environmental protections, we wind up paying later at a much higher cost.\nIf we lose the environmental protections we have now, we will end up with more stories like Onondaga Lake. We’ll watch lakes, streams and rivers go from vibrant resources valued for their beauty, recreational opportunities and ecosystem services to uninhabitable dead zones that are dangerous, unsightly, and avoided by tourists and others who would otherwise support the local economy.\nNo one wants to deal with excessive regulation. But no one wants their favorite fishing site polluted, their swimming beach closed or their drinking water compromised. No one wants Superfund sites in their communities. And no one wants to shoulder the extremely high costs of cleaning up sites once they’ve been polluted. We are all stakeholders when it comes to clean water, and we all pay dearly when our waters are polluted."},{"url":"http://www.sfchronicle.com/movies/article/Wonder-Woman-a-different-kind-of-action-11185883.php","title":"‘Wonder Woman’ gives different perspective to an action movie","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"San Francisco Chronicle","description":"Gal Gadot has the title role, and she has appeared in enough films that her screen magnetism comes as no surprise — but the impact of that magnetism is a surprise.

Like a screen star from the 1930s, her beauty in “Wonder Woman” is an event in itself, not just pleasing but interesting. So when she puts on glasses, that’s interesting. When she changes into the fashions of 1918, that’s also interesting. Hat or no hat? That’s interesting, too.\nThis is not critical foaming at the mouth — when you see this film you will get it, women and men — because we’re not talking about the libido here. We’re talking about a face that holds the audience in a happy state of suspension and awe, so that when a close-up comes, everybody stops breathing and looks. This doesn’t happen often — in color films it barely happens at all — but director Patty Jenkins knows what she has in Gadot and uses close-ups with the deftness of a George Cukor or some other great golden-age director.\nWonder Woman begins life on an island paradise, hidden by Zeus from Ares, the god of War. The Amazons are an entirely female race of warriors, preparing for a combat that might never take place. Diana (Gadot) has a special fate in all this, but she doesn’t know it yet, and then one day an American soldier crashes his biplane near the Amazon island. It’s World War I, and he is being pursued by Germans. Suddenly, the outside world has penetrated.\nThe soldier, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), has to make it back to the Allied lines, and she spontaneously decides to accompany him. She has a sword and a shield and has the naive idea that if she can locate and kill Ares, the god of war, she will put an end to the fighting. This begins what is probably the most enjoyable part of the movie. Because Diana knows nothing about men and about modern civilization, it’s fun to watch her make discoveries.\nIn the London of 1918, she reacts to the noise and the cars. She finds out about ice cream and revolving doors and likes both. She also comes to realize that a woman’s opinion is perhaps not quite so valued as it was back home. And she sees a world that is full of destruction and misery on such a scale as to be beyond imagining.\nThis is where “Wonder Woman” becomes more than just fun and war games. This film easily could have been another tiresome exercise that defines feminism as any time a woman gets to be as violent as the most horrible man. Instead, it goes in the opposite direction. It presents Diana as the Female Principle representing the arts of life and, ultimately, love, in collision with a world that men have been collectively trying to destroy for at least the past 100 years.\nAlong this line, “Wonder Woman” achieves touching and powerful moments that are unusual for a movie of this kind. In particular, there’s a scene in which Diana walks through a town that has been gassed and all its inhabitants killed. We get a couple of shots of Gadot as seen from behind, a witness to cruelty, with the rest of the frame filled with orange smoke. Consider also that it’s an Israeli actress of Eastern European descent at the center of that frame, standing across a gulf of time that would include even greater horrors.\nFortunately, not all men are bad. No, there are some good ones, such as Steve Trevor, who has an affecting quality here of always trying to catch up. Sometimes he has to head off the consequences of Diana’s naivete, and sometimes he has to rise to the demands of her insight. But he can barely tell the difference. David Thewlis finds unexpected nuance in the role of a gentle parliamentarian. And on the other side of the lines, Danny Huston adds to his rogues’ gallery as a German general looking for military victory through nerve gas.\nAt times, “Wonder Woman” descends to the level of a comic-book movie, with a scene or two reminiscent of “Iron Man,” but such moments are comparatively brief.

White wind turbines, two stories high, dot the desert landscape all of the way to the base of snowcapped mountains in the distance.\nSeismologist and earthquake expert Lucy Jones is standing on a small hill looking south, towards California’s most consequential fault: the San Andreas. It runs nearly the length of the state, from the Salton Sea to near Mendocino. From where we’re standing, the only evidence of the fault are slight indentations in the earth, snaking through the landscape. There are rocks and soil that’ve been moved by years of tectonic plates shifting below us.\nJones is surrounded by scrub brush and government officials from across Southern California. She’s brought them to bake in the desert sun to convince them that they need to do more to get ready for “the big one.”\n“If you are in the Coachella Valley, don’t plan on getting to L.A. anytime after the earthquake, unless you have some way of flying,” she warns.\nIf there’s an earthquake on this section of the San Andreas, the region stands to lose large parts of the 10 freeway, she says. The earth could shift as much as 25 feet, incapacitating any utilities that cross the fault, which include water canals, natural gas pipelines and power lines. It could leave large parts of Southern California stranded.\nShe says the fault is capable of a magnitude 8.2 earthquake. The Northridge quake was a 6.7.\n“This will happen at some point. Plate tectonics isn’t turning off,” Jones says. “When it happens, we’re not going to have water. It’s going to take six months to get water back in all of our houses. We could lose electricity for the whole western U.S. We’re going to have no transportation. City-wide fires have the potential to burn down the city.”\nFor more than 15 years, Jones has been painting these nightmare scenarios, first as a seismologist for the U.S. Geological Survey, and now as an independent scientist, trying to convince businesses and governments to better prepare their emergency services, transportation grids and infrastructure.\nSome cities, including Los Angeles, which hired Jones for a time, have heeded her advice. They figured out new rules for seismic retrofits, strengthened cell phone towers and took steps to further protect water systems, but there’s still more to be done. And some cities haven’t taken action to prepare at all.\n“The challenge really is we are myopic,” says Howard Kunreuther, author of “The Ostrich Paradox: Why We Underprepare for Disasters.” “We focus on the short run and as a result don’t really think about any kind of long-term decisions[…]about how we prepare.”\nIt’s tough to convince cities to prepare for something that’s not right in front of them, especially when things like potholes and homelessness are ever-present.\nThere hasn’t been a big quake on the San Andreas in over 160 years, making one long overdue, according to Jones. And since it’s so overdue, the likelihood of it happening is higher, as pressure between the plates builds.\nBut Kunreuther says people react to the disaster that just happened. That after Northridge, a lot of people purchased earthquake insurance, but over time the number of insured has declined, even as the risk of earthquake has continued to rise.\n“We say, this event will not happen to me. So as a result, we don’t have to pay attention,” he says. “So, we think the likelihood of an earthquake occurring in California is sufficiently low that we don’t really have to buy insurance or undertake the protective measures that one should.”\nBabara Kogerman, a city councilwoman from Laguna Hills, was listening to Jones out in the desert. She says that she’s been worried about being prepared for the big one, but that Jones helped bring the issue into focus.\nAnd that’s the kind of reaction Jones is hoping she’ll get with her apocalyptic stories."},{"url":"http://www.wnyc.org/story/white-house-communications-director-resigns-amid-tensions","title":"White House Communications Director Resigns Amid Tensions","author_text":null,"keywords":["Npr","New York","Wnyc","Arts","Culture","News","Public","Radio"],"publication_text":"WNYC","description":"The departure of Michael Dubke, Trump's communications director, comes as aides say Trump has grown increasingly frustrated by allegations of ...","date":"","full_text":"A top White House communications staffer has resigned as President Donald Trump considers a major staff overhaul.\nThe departure of Michael Dubke, Trump's communications director, comes as aides say Trump has grown increasingly frustrated by allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and revelations of possible ties between his campaign and Moscow.\nTrump tweeted Tuesday: \"Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. \u0026 how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.\"\nDubke wrote in a statement that it had been an honor to serve Trump and \"my distinct pleasure to work side-by-side, day-by-day with the staff of the communications and press departments.\"\nDubke's last day has not yet been determined.\nA Republican consultant, Dubke joined the White House team in February after campaign aide Jason Miller - Trump's original choice for communications director - withdrew from the White House team. Dubke founded Crossroads Media, a GOP firm that specializes in political advertising.\nDubke is the latest White House staffer to leave this administration as scrutiny intensifies over contacts Trump staffers may have had with Russian government officials during the campaign and transition period.\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Dubke resigned before Trump left for his international trip earlier this month, suggesting that his departure is not linked to any pending shake-ups.\nBut his departure raises questions about whether previous Trump loyalists are headed to the White House. Trump has entertained formally bringing back his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and former deputy campaign manager, David Bossie.\nBossie told Fox News' \"Fox \u0026 Friends\" that the Trump administration has reached out to him but hasn't offered him a job yet.\n\"They have talked to many people, including me,\" Bossie said. He later added: \"It's an ongoing conversation and that's a fair way to put it.\"\nIn an interview on Fox News on Tuesday, Conway said Dubke \"made very clear that he would see through the president's international trip, and come to work every day and work hard even through that trip because there was much to do here back at the White House.\"\nDubke's hiring was intended to lighten the load on Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, who had also been handling the duties of communications director during Trump's first month in office. Trump has privately pinned some of the blame for his administration's rough start on the White House's communications strategy.\nWhile overseas, Trump's longtime lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, joined a still-forming legal team to help the president shoulder the intensifying investigations into Russian interference in the election and his associates' potential involvement. More attorneys with deep experience in Washington investigations are expected to be added, along with crisis communication experts, to help the White House in the weeks ahead.\nThe latest revelations to emerge last week involved Trump's son-in-law and top aide, Jared Kushner. Shortly after the election, Kushner allegedly discussed setting up a secret communications channel with the Russian government to facilitate sensitive discussions about the conflict in Syria.\nThe intent was to connect Trump's chief national security adviser at the time, Michael Flynn, with Russian military leaders, a person familiar with the discussions told the AP. The person wasn't authorized to publicly discuss private policy deliberations and insisted on anonymity.\nFlynn handed in his resignation in February after it was revealed he misled top White House officials about his contacts with Russian officials.\nThe disclosure of the back channel has put the White House on the defensive. Just back from his nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe, Trump dismissed recent reports as \"fake news.\"\nTrump also has renewed his criticism of Germany following Chancellor Angela Merkel's suggestion that her country needs to adopt a more independent stance in world affairs.\nTrump posted a tweet Tuesday saying \"we have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO \u0026 military.

Between the second and third months of pregnancy, she fell ill with the Zika virus, which is mainly spread by mosquitoes. For a week, she suffered fever, headaches and pain. She felt very weak.\nBut the hardest blow was still to come. At the ultrasound, four to five months into her pregnancy, the doctor said the baby had microcephaly, a birth defect linked to Zika and marked by an abnormally small head and underdeveloped brain.\nNews of the baby’s condition upset her husband, whose name Fabiane declines to give. Shortly before Valentina’s birth, the two parents exchanged text messages:\n“Maybe it would be necessary to take the baby before it’s time,” Lopes texted.\n“To abort,” he replied.\n“No, to make a treatment outside in another place.”\n“Fabiane,” the husband texted back, “you know what I think about this child. So what do you want from me?”\n“Then the thing you want the most,” Lopes wrote, “is that she dies.”\n“Yes,” he replied.\nHe left before Valentina’s birth and has not returned.\nValentina is one of 2,366 babies with microcephaly born in Brazil between November 2015 and December 2016.\nWhile Zika remains a problem in Brazil, it has slowed significantly. According to Ana Bispo, a virologist at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, there were 4,900 reported Zika cases in Brazil during the first 12 weeks of 2017, a huge drop from the same period in 2016, when the nation saw more than 142,000 Zika cases.\nBrazil recently declared Zika no longer a public health emergency, following a significant mosquito eradication program.\nIn the United States, there have been more than 5,200 Zika cases reported since Jan. 1, 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been 58 infants born since 2016 with birth defects possibly caused by Zika.\nThe Zika virus interrupts formation of the brain during a critical stage of fetal development.\n“The virus crosses the placenta and infects the neurons,” Bispo says. “It blocks the development of the brain. The brain itself, it does not grow.”\nOnce a pregnant mother learns her baby has microcephaly, there is nothing she can do.\n“There is no medication for Zika,” Bispo says. “There is nothing.”\nWhen she saw the ultrasound of her baby, Lopes did not understand what microcephaly was. The doctor told her that the head was smaller. She could see the feet were not right either; the baby had the deformity known as clubfoot.\nThe doctor was not even sure the baby would survive.\nIt wasn’t until a week before the birth that Lopes gained a fuller understanding of her baby’s condition. She was on Facebook and saw a picture of a baby with microcephaly.\nThe condition is linked to seizures, hearing loss, vision problems, intellectual disability and problems with balance and movement. Scientists say more studies will need to be done to determine the long-term effects of Zika-related microcephaly.\nLopes gave birth to Valentina at 37 weeks, a little earlier than the normal 40. And for at least a moment, it didn’t matter that the baby looked different.\n“I felt so happy,” Lopes says, speaking through an interpreter. “I felt love when I had the baby in my arms.”\nSoon after, the doctor asked if she wanted a tubal ligation to ensure that she would not have any more children. Lopes said yes.\nWithout a husband to help her, she knew motherhood would be difficult. She asked God for wisdom.\nMark Hoffman / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\nToday, 16 months after her baby’s birth, she has a better appreciation of what it means to raise a child with microcephaly.\nValentina is in almost constant pain, which means Lopes goes nights without sleep. “It’s not easy, but I will not give up,” she says.\nThe mother has faced difficult times before. Her daughter, Julia, now 4, was born with microcrania, a condition marked by a smaller-than-normal cranium.\n“People said she would not walk. She would not talk,” Lopes says. “Now she talks. She sings. She dances.”\nJulia’s progress gives her hope for the baby.\nValentina’s pain has meant a slew of medications, which drain the family’s finances every month.\nLopes receives 934 reais (about $300) in assistance from the federal government each month. But the costs of Valentina’s medicines alone add up quickly. Depakene, a medication used to treat seizure disorders, costs about $6 for each box, and she goes through four boxes each month. Another anti-seizure medicine, Vidmax topiramato, costs $25 to $28 for each box. There are other medications, too.\nPaying is a struggle without her husband, who had a steady job at a beer factory. Her own mother is dead, and she has no other extended family. Lopes and her family must depend on support from neighbors and friends.\nShe takes Valentina to see the doctor as often as she can, but it is difficult to reach the hospital on time. Lopes misses appointments either because she can’t afford bus fare or the bus gets caught in rush hour traffic.\nValentina looks younger than 16 months. She is a little smaller than normal for her age. Because she cannot eat with her mouth, she requires a feeding tube.\nValentina was also born with a scar near her eye. Lopes says it is unclear how much she can see, if at all. “I have to wait for her timing and God’s timing, but I hope that her sight will normalize,” Lopes says. “Her sight is very fragile.”\nWhen Lopes takes her baby daughter out in public, “people look a lot (at Valentina),” she says. “When someone starts looking too much, I start kissing her to show love.”\nShe imagines her daughter saying, “My mom loves me so much that she doesn’t even see that my head is smaller.”\nWhen Valentina cries out, which is often, the other children come running to hold her and kiss her. The older girl, Eduarda, 9, helps a great deal, feeding Valentina, changing her and holding her.\n“I taught them to love Valentina as I do,” Lopes says.\nValentina loves the stimulation provided by music and toys, and does exercises to help her feet. The physical therapy is important, says Fernanda Daniel Fialho, a doctor in Rio de Janeiro, specializing in pediatric intensive care.\nFialho says it is not clear yet whether the babies affected by Zika will ever learn to walk and talk. “We don’t know if they will grow up healthy. We don’t know the disease.”\nIn the absence of answers, Lopes provides the one thing she can: a mother’s devotion.\n“Everything I do, I do for her,” the mother says, her brown eyes widening as she talks about Valentina.\n“I do everything I can. If God does take Valentina, at least I will know I did all of my best for her. I did everything I could. I could do no more.\"\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Mark Johnson studied the growing threat posed by diseases that jump from animals to humans during a nine-month O'Brien Fellowship in Public Service Journalism at Marquette University.\nHe was assisted by Marquette student researchers McKenna Oxenden, Ryan Patterson and Devi Shastri.\nMarquette University and administrators of the program played no role in the reporting, editing or presentation of this project.\nAdditionally, the Pulitzer Center on Crisis reporting, which funds international reporting on underreported topics, is providing support for this ongoing series of stories.\nThis story is based on extensive interviews in Brazil with yellow fever patients, relatives of those who died of the disease, doctors, researchers and health officials.

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\nIt’s not often that the story of an internationally known musician begins on a cattle drive.\nBut that’s where it started for 78-year-old Van Knauss.\nAnd no, we’re not talking about cowboy guitar or a wah-wah campfire harmonica thing.\nKnauss is a master of the organ — the baroque pipes, the swelling fugue soaring in a church nave. He was once called “Close to Perfection” by a Washington music critic and “J.S. Bach reincarnated” by a fan.\nBut back to the cattle drive.\nKnauss was a little kid in the 1940s, riding in his dad’s truck, driving cattle from their Colorado ranch to Denver. In town, they passed an organ studio, and Dad stopped to take a look. That was it. No more cattle for little Van.\nSeeing all those rows of keys, the thumb pistons and toe studs that change the register of the organ, the draw knobs that shift the ranks of pipes used, the incredible complexity of this instrument — and how different it was from his life on the cattle ranch — Knauss was hooked.\nKnauss and his twin sister, both already having played piano, began taking organ lessons from the man in Denver.\nThat led to music degrees from Union College in Lincoln, Neb., and then from the University of Nebraska, a job as a television organist, a PhD in music from Catholic University in Washington, a stint as a much-loved radio organist and, finally, the big party in the basement of Hughes United Methodist Church last Sunday.\nYou see, pipe organs are not especially portable instruments. And it’s not always easy for an organist to find an organ to play.\nBut in 1966, Hughes United Methodist Church in Wheaton, Md., had just installed an organ. It was one of the finest that the Newcomer Organ Co., run by D.C. brothers known for their mastery of remanufacturing new organs out of parts from older ones, had built. It had brand-new pipes from Moller, one of the nation’s most prolific pipe builders, with 12,000 pipes in chapels across the country. There were thirty-five ranks of pipes — sets that produce the same timbre for each note — and a set of pipes, called antiphonal pipes, jutting dramatically out over the interior from the rear balcony.\nIt was a beauty.\nBut the church’s search committee was having a hard time finding the right musician to play it. Then they met Knauss, and they told him they would try him out. He played the next Sunday, May 28, 1967. And the Sunday after that.\nA month later, when he asked about the committee’s progress, they said the committee was still searching. He continued to play.\nEach time he asked, he heard the same: “The committee is still searching.”\nAnd 50 years later, as he stood before the congregation at Hughes after playing one of at least 4,000 preludes he had performed on that organ, Knauss confessed, “I’m starting to have doubts about this committee.”\nKnauss has also played in some of the great cathedrals of Europe, held forth in some of America’s grand concert halls and produced several albums over the decades.\nBut every Sunday, in between concerts, tours, recitals and teaching, he came home to Hughes.\n“You played at my wedding!” said Susan Stevenson, 72, as she grabbed Knauss’s hand in the church social hall at the surprise reception on Sunday. “August 12, 1967!”\nTurns out that Aug. 12 is Knauss’s birthday.\n“So you played at my wedding on your birthday?” Stevenson said.\n“Of course I played on my birthday,” Knauss answered.\n“You played at my daughter’s wedding, too,” she told him.\nAnd so it went all morning and into the afternoon. Students from Washington Adventist University, where he taught for decades; fellow organists; church members who listened to him for a half-century — they were all there.\nThey surprised him with a tribute in three movements, a piece for a brass quartet and organ, that was composed and performed for Knauss by D.C. musician Ken Lowenberg.\n“It was like Van — bouncy and bright, a little jazzy,” Lowenberg said. “And also contemplative.”\nHe teared up during the sonata.\nKnauss began as a very conservative player. That’s not surprising in a realm of music associated with churches, weddings and funerals.\nIt was years before Knauss confessed to playing in a restaurant in his early years.\n“While some were critical of my dabbling with that kind of music, I have no regrets about also having had that kind of experience,” he explained in a résumé.\nBut he eventually opened up about playing transcriptions — music not written for the organ, but transcribed for it — and became known for his bouncy, bright hymnal improvisations.\nIt’s no surprise that organ music is struggling to stay relevant, said fellow organist Arla Clapp. Not all churches can maintain their organs. As she was telling me this, she stopped Marie Bunting, the church bookkeeper circulating between the hors d’oeuvres and the guests, to ask her what upkeep costs.\nMarie pushed her horn-rims up on her nose and looked up for a moment.\n“About $8,000 a year,” she said.\n“See, so many churches are struggling to afford them,” Clapp said.\nTechnological innovation may eventually mimic a grand pipe organ, although even the ones with nearly 200 microprocessors are derided in the conservative organ community.\nAnd there are rebels rocking the organ world, like Cameron Carpenter — who wears a mohawk, leather and sequins when he performs. He studs the heels of his organ slippers — special shoes organists wear so they can use their toes, arches and heels on the organ pedals — with rhinestones.\nBut Knauss isn’t going that far. He is trying to keep his art alive through his many students, including his youngest one.\nGrandson Grant Knauss, 8, is studying under his grandpa and said he loves the way the organ’s deep notes rumble in his gut.\n“His legs are still a little short, but he’s growing,” Knauss said.\nGrant said sure, he wants to play some classical organ, like his grandfather. “But also classical rock or classical pop,” he said.\nTake a while to grow those legs, Grant.\nOf all the words said about Grandpa on Sunday — humble, genius, gentleman, decent, brilliant, virtuoso — there was one word no one was saying:\nRetirement.\nTwitter: @petulad\nRead more Petula Dvorak:\nHe was paralyzed in a shooting, but she still wanted to marry him."},{"url":"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/05/is-the-urban-renaissance-over/528135","title":"Is the Urban Renaissance Really Over?","author_text":"Joe Cortright","keywords":[],"publication_text":"CityLab","description":"The suburbs might be growing faster right now, but don’t be glum about the prospects for urban growth and revitalization.","date":"","full_text":"Earlier this week, The New York Times published an op-ed from Jed Kolko—”Seattle Climbs but Austin Sprawls, The Myth of the Return to Cities”—offering up another iteration of his long running argument that the urban rebound is overstated. His key point: in the aggregate, suburbs are growing faster than cities, and the density of most metropolitan areas continues to decrease.\nThe article is surely refuting something of a straw man: not everyone is moving back to cities everywhere. And some big metro areas in the Sun Belt continue to sprawl rapidly. But even if they aren’t absolutely outperforming suburbs everywhere, cities are relatively much stronger than they were a decade (and especially several decades) ago, and are disproportionately attracting the best and the brightest. The chief reason they’re not doing even better—as Kolko concedes—is that we’re not building housing in city centers fast enough.\nKolko indicated that the move back to city centers is real:\nThat revival is real, but it has mostly been for rich, educated people in particular hyperurban neighborhoods rather than a broad-based return to city living. To be sure, college-educated millennials — at least those without school-age kids — took to the city, and better-paying jobs have shifted there, too. But other groups — older adults, families with kids in school, and people of all ages with lower incomes — either can’t afford or don’t want an urban address.\nAnd coincidentally, at the same time The Wall Street Journal summarized a new report from BuildZoom’s Issi Romem which emphasized the growing demand for housing in cities. Romem’s work shows that home sales have accelerated closer to the urban core in most cities, and remain depressed in the suburbs. The takeaway:\nWhile new home sales within 5 miles of the centers of 10 of the country’s priciest and most densely populated metropolitan areas have surpassed levels from 2000, they remain more than 50% below where they were in 2000 when you go more than 10 miles out.\nAs Justin Fox pointed out at Bloomberg, we’re bumping up against the limits of supply in cities. More and more Americans, especially young adults, want to live in cities, but the supply of housing there is constrained, and growing only slowly—which is why rents have spiked in cities. And while more households may be locating in less dense neighborhoods, the price of housing in suburbs has fallen relative to that in city centers.\nMore From\nWe’ll weigh in soon with our own City Observatory analysis of these data, but in the meantime, we think that several of the points that we raised a few weeks back about Kolko’s last round of research are worth remembering. There are several key reasons why no one should be glum about the continuing prospects for urban growth and revitalization.\nFirst, employment and population data aggregated nationally by county don’t reveal much about the most urban neighborhoods. We’ve made this point before with Kolko’s analysis of job growth. County boundaries correspond poorly, if at all, with cities or urban density.\nConsider Chicago, which gets tarred with the “Biggest Loser” title in earlier Kolko’s tabulations. While Cook County saw an overall decline in population, the most urban parts of the city, including its Downtown Loop and Northside neighborhoods, continued to rack up big gains.\nA more finely grained geographic analysis shows that the closer you get to the city center in most metros, the stronger has been the performance. While it’s true that the more outlying parts of some cities are losing population, their cores are becoming increasingly vibrant. As we’ve noted, that notion of critical mass at the neighborhood level is one of the defining characteristics of urban growth.\nSecond, national aggregations conceal local patterns. To be sure, these data show a renewed growth in the sunbelt. And in the biggest Sun Belt metros, a big chunk of the growth is in their sprawling suburbs (Houston, Dallas). But the growth in these metros is not representative of what’s happening in many other places.\nThird, there’s a baseline issue here. City growth has decelerated from the past year or two. But city growth this decade looks far different than it did a decade ago. While Kolko’s FiveThirtyEight.com post just shows the change in city and suburb growth rates over the past few years (and emphasizes the one-year change between 2015 and 2016), his longer blog post on his own website shows the change in population by type of county since 2001. Taking this longer view, it’s apparent that growth rates in suburbs have declined sharply since the last decade, while growth rates in urban counties were up.\nBetween 2001 and 2005, low-density suburban counties (gray line) were growing more than 2 percent per year—their growth rates since 2011 are about half that. During that same time, the most urban counties (blue line) were growing sluggishly or losing population—and they’re now growing. While urban counties dramatically underperformed suburban ones last decade, the growth patterns have converged dramatically since then. As a result, when judged against the baseline of the previous decade, more urban counties have accelerated, while more suburban ones have faded.\nFourth, in many places, we’re bumping up against the (policy-induced) limits to meeting the market demand for urban living. In the early stages of growth, cities can add population by filling vacant housing. But as vacancy rates fall, the only way to accommodate more people is to add more housing, which is a process that (a) takes time, and (b) is too often unfortunately encumbered by NIMBY building restrictions. That suburbs might grow faster than cities for a time is not necessarily evidence of a declining demand for city living, so much as it is evidence that we haven’t expanded the supply of urban living opportunities to meet that demand.\nThis article originally appeared on CityObservatory."},{"url":"https://theconversation.com/americas-worsening-global-reputation-could-put-billions-in-us-exports-at-risk-78152","title":"America's worsening global reputation could put billions in US exports at risk","author_text":"Boryana V Dimitrova","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Conversation","description":"Surveys show Trump's election is damaging America's reputation abroad, which research suggests could deal a sharp blow to US trade.","date":"","full_text":"U.S. News and World Report recently published its annual “Best Countries” ranking, based on how thousands of people around the world perceive other nations.

And in that department, the election of Donald Trump may be contributing to the problem.\nPew surveyed citizens of 10 European Union countries last year and found that 85 percent of respondents had no confidence that Trump would do the “right thing” in world affairs. And since the election, 75 percent of those surveyed around the world for the Best Countries ranking – which came out in April – said they had lost some degree of respect for the U.S.\nAs a result, experts predict the U.S. will receive 4.3 million fewer visitors in this year than in 2016, in part because changes to immigration policy are making tourists feel unwelcome.\nOf additional concern is that relations between the U.S. and some key trading partners have taken a turn for the worse. For example, the U.S. exports more to Mexico than any other country but Canada. Yet the president’s insistence on a proposed border wall has probably harmed the United States’ reputation among Mexican citizens and businesspeople.\nOpening a window\nOur recently published research (sponsored in part by the Oxford University Centre for Corporate Reputation) provides a window into how intangible perceptions such as reputation can produce very tangible consequences.\nOur measure of country reputation was the Anholt-GfK Nation Brands Index, which is based on a global survey of more than 20,000 respondents across 20 countries. We used the results from 2008, the last year for which data are publicly available. Respondents in those countries rated the country reputation of the other 19 countries as well as 30 additional countries around the globe, creating a matrix of country-pairs (Canada’s reputation among Germans, Germany’s reputation among Brazilians, etc.).\nTo measure various dimensions of country reputation, the surveys included ratings both for the quality of a country’s products and the trustworthiness of its people.\nTo capture export volume, we pulled data from the United Nations Statistical Division Commodity Trade Statistics Database for each country-pair. We wanted to make sure we were seeing only the potential impact of country reputation on exports (and not the other way around) so we downloaded trade data for 2010, two years after the reputation data were collected.\nCombining the export figures with the reputation data resulted in a unique dataset of 861 country-pairs (e.g., Italy’s reputation among the French and Italian exports to France two years later).\nWe then applied what has been described as “one of the most successful empirical models in economics” (economists call it the structural gravity model of international trade) to test whether this relationship panned out on a global scale. Essentially, the model enables us to test the effect of reputation on exports for each specific trade relationship.\nTo exclude alternative explanations, we also accounted for a host of other factors that are known to influence trade between countries, such as the size of each market, geographic distance and having a common official language.\nHow reputation affects trade\nWe were amazed at what we found.\nEach ranking drop in a country’s reputation is associated with a decrease in export volume of 2 percent. As an illustrative example, if the U.S. were to drop one reputational rung among Canadians, we would expect – all other things equal – a corresponding 2 percent decrease in exports to Canada. If we apply the results to 2016 exports, that would mean a potential loss of more than US$5 billion.\nFrom another perspective, the effect is roughly equivalent to an importing country raising tariffs by 3 percent. For a large exporter like the United States (about $1.5 trillion in exported goods per year), a uniform drop in reputation could put tens of billions in manufacturing exports in jeopardy.\nOf course, the relationship works both ways. If reputation improves, our model predicts the same corresponding increase in export volume.\nThe Trump administration has made stimulating exports a priority and argues that “international trade can be used to grow our economy, return millions of jobs to America’s shores and revitalize our nation’s suffering communities.”\nYet, in his efforts to do this, he appears to be ignoring a meaningful ingredient: reputation.\nOur research makes one thing clear: Countries ignore their international reputations at their peril. If Trump is serious about increasing exports, a good place to start would be improving America’s – and his – standing in the world."},{"url":"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/new-orleans-confederate-monument-removal-night-government-transparency","title":"Undercover Monument Removal in New Orleans Sparks Transparency Debate","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"“We think that to do it in the dark sort of defeats the purpose.”","date":"","full_text":"Jefferson Davis is coming down, but I can’t tell you exactly when, and I don’t know who will remove him. His dethroning has been in the works since Mayor Mitch Landrieu asked the New Orleans City Council to consider removing four Confederate and white supremacist monuments in 2015. The request came weeks after the racially motivated killings of nine churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, but some had called for their dismantling for decades.\nLast week, after a year and a half of court challenges, the first monument was removed in dead of night. Davis is next — Landrieu has said he’ll come down from his spot at Jeff Davis Parkway and Canal Street in the next 30 to 45 days — but the city government won’t provide more detail than that, and won’t be throwing a celebration.\nIndeed, a decision some say Landrieu made to bulk up his progressive credentials appears to be backfiring on both sides.\nIn a bid to protect the identities of contractors and workers, the city is using private funds funneled through a nonprofit entity not subject to the same public bidding process or transparency laws as a public agency. According to the New Orleans Advocate, over $600,000 has been donated to the Foundation for Louisiana for the removal work, and the nonprofit has an agreement with the city to use those donations to work with contractors and pay all removal costs.\nDays after that agreement was signed, masked workers took down the first monument, an obelisk honoring a Reconstruction-era uprising by white citizens against the city’s integrated police force. Its plaque explicitly declared white supremacy the law of the land until 1993. The monument was removed at 3 a.m., under protection of snipers, and carted away in trucks with the logos blacked out.\nThose who want the monuments to stay argue this secrecy prevents citizens from ensuring the work is being done well, and that it flies in the face of Landrieu’s claim that the removals are about unity. The city says it is a necessary precaution. A company that had been publicly contracted for the job in 2016 received death threats, and around the same time, the owner’s Lamborghini was torched in his driveway. For the past few weeks, pro-Confederacy protesters, many of them from outside New Orleans, have been camped out around the monuments, sporting flags and frequently guns.\nTake Em Down NOLA, the people of color-led advocacy group that has been calling for the removal or replacement of hundreds of statues, and street and school names associated with the Confederacy and white supremacy, is questioning the secrecy too.\nAfter years of organizing for this moment, “we definitely envisioned it as a public event,” says Michael “Quess?” Moore, a lead organizer and co-founder of Take Em Down NOLA. Though he supports the removal, he questions Landrieu’s motives as self-serving and hypocritical — political opportunism.\n“You clearly don’t want to follow through even on the fullness of what this symbolizes and represents. If it symbolizes and represents, what we want, the complete undoing and healing of white supremacy, and the healing of the wounds that white supremacy inflicted, but you do it at night? And you hide from it? No, you’ve once again given white supremacy a platform and emboldened it and empowered it by doing that,” he says. “We think that to do it in the dark sort of defeats the purpose.”\nThe argument for worker safety and contractor anonymity doesn’t hold water for Quess? either.\n“They said safety, we said bullshit. We said Katrina: You called the National Guard on your own citizens when they were trying to escape a flooded city,” he says. In other words, he’s seen how forceful a city can be with its own citizens; does it truly lack the resources to protect against a few out-of-town neo-Confederates? Columbia, South Carolina, he notes, held a public ceremony when the Confederate flag was lowered and removed from the statehouse in 2015 — without incident, just a few weeks after the Charleston shooting. Quess? says the long delay between the New Orleans City Council voting to remove the statues and the actual removal has allowed the opposition to foment and organize, making an increasingly unsafe situation from an ever-controversial one.\nDonald Cohen, executive director of In the Public Interest, an Oakland-based nonprofit that focuses on government accountability and responsible contracting across the U.S., says he’s rarely seen lack of transparency justified as a way to protect workers. The closest comparison he can think of are laws that try to shield police officers from retaliation by protecting their personal information. It’s a common yet troubling practice, he says, for cities to break up contracts in order to keep them below a certain dollar amount to avoid a public bidding process or a council vote. But the New Orleans scenario is new to him, and he sees it as double-edged.\n“It certainly raises red flags. There’s clearly a legitimate security issue, the question is how you deal with it. Complete lack of transparency is not a good thing,” he says.\nThere’s the concern raised by the monuments’ supporters — that the statues could be damaged in deconstruction or transit — and the more standard good government concern that public money is being spent well, though that question is complicated in this case by the use of private funding.\n“You have to be able to balance those concerns, which are real and not to be ignored, with the security concerns, and I’m sure there’s a way to do it other than keeping everything secret,” says Cohen. “I’m not saying every contract is a corrupt deal, but there are reasons for things to be transparent: Are we getting what we paid for, are there deals being done that’s benefiting someone more than they should be benefiting, are there favors being given, are the quality of services adequate for what we want for the public?”\nIn this case, the lack of transparency seems to further goals of people in favor of racial justice, but Cohen can imagine scenarios in which the opposite would be true. Hundreds of architects have publicly declared they wouldn’t build President Donald Trump’s border wall along the country’s southern border. What if they could be offered anonymity? “You don’t have to stretch very far to think that the Trump administration would do that,” says Cohen.\nThis weekend, Take Em Down NOLA will host its own removal celebration, a “Second Line to Bury White Supremacy” that will march from Congo Square to Lee Circle, where a statue of Robert E. Lee, slated for removal, still stands. Maybe it will be gone by Sunday — Landrieu’s not talking.\nThe Monumental Task Committee, which opposes the removal, and the Foundation for Louisiana, did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2016/jun/08/henley-young-must-release-kids-after-21-days-some-","title":"Henley-Young Must Release Kids After 21 Days; Some Disappearing?","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Out of three children released under the Henley-Young Juvenile Justice Center's recent policy of not detaining young people after 21 days, one is missing, one is back in custody, and the third was released without treatment, Youth Court Judge William Skinner says.","date":"","full_text":"A consent-decree agreement in federal court between the Hinds County Board of Supervisors and several plaintiffs, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, mandates that the Henley-Young Juvenile Justice Center release juveniles after 21 days, a requirement Youth Court Judge William Skinner is fighting in court. Trip Burns/File Photo\nJACKSON — Out of three children released under the Henley-Young Juvenile Justice Center's recent policy of not detaining young people after 21 days, one is missing, one is back in custody, and the third was released without treatment, Youth Court Judge William Skinner says.\nSkinner cited these instances, along with the \"irreparable harm\" that could come to the children released, as evidence that the court should grant his motion to intervene against new requirements placed on how long his court could place a child into custody at Henley-Young. A settlement agreement, referred to as the consent decree, between Hinds County and plaintiffs in a 2011 lawsuit over the conditions at the center, requires that the children are released after 21 days.\n\"One such child, namely C.M., was serving a 90-day commitment,\" a court memorandum by Skinner states. \"Said child was released to his sister. However, within five days of said child's release from Henley-Young Juvenile Justice Center, he was re-arrested and charged with auto burglary.\" The minor was also harmed, the document states, \"as a direct and proximate result of his encounter with law enforcement.\"\nThe second child listed in Skinner's motion was J.M.M., who was released May 16 to the care and custody of the Mississippi Department of Human Services with a plan to transfer the child to treatment at Diamond Grove, a mental-health facility in Louisville, Miss. All did not go according to plan.\n\"However, within hours of said child's release from Henley-Young Juvenile Justice Center, said child fled the custody of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, and (as of this filing) ... said minor is still missing.\" Another child, listed only as D.B., was also released, except without the benefit of the court-ordered treatment from Diamond Grove.\nNinety days is the longest time a young person may be in detention under state statute, but since 2012, Henley-Young can only legally hold young people for 21 days. Skinner and those plaintiffs in that lawsuit, which include the Southern Poverty Law Center and Disability Rights Mississippi, have exchanged memoranda over the time limit, with a hearing scheduled later this month in federal court.\nWilliam Bardwell, an SPLC attorney, said in a June 6 phone interview that a large part of the issue is whether or not the court should have to release the children but the lock-up approach to juvenile justice.\n\"I think a huge part of this is over-sentencing kids,\" Bardwell said. \"Ninety days is not supposed to be a standard sentence. Ninety days is the lengthiest sentence that the youth court can give under Mississippi law.\"\nSkinner, though, is adamant that releasing the children after only 21 days could be premature.\n\"In the event that personnel with the Henley-Young Juvenile Detention Center is allowed to continue releasing children, without said children receiving the rehabilitative services necessary, these children will fall prey to not only their own devices, but find themselves in positions where the harm inflicted upon them and the community will be irreparable,\" he wrote.\nIrreparable Harm\nThe amended consent decree outlined a multi-part plan for addressing conditions within Henley-Young.\nThese included how the children, age 10 through 17, are brought into the facility, how they are treated for mental and physical ailments, and even whether or not they are provided with their own hygiene products.\nAgreed to on March 3 of this year and extended until 2018, the amended consent decree states that \"the parties also agree that Henley-Young is a short-term facility not designed to hold residents for longer than 21 days.\" The consent decree requires that the detention facility only hold a maximum daily population of 32 residents at any time, a sharp contrast to the 84 children held there before the 2012 consent decree.\nSkinner, who has been the youth judge since 2006, was not included in the suit, or the amended consent decree. He and the other parties have continued to trade barbs through alternating motions, and now all will have to appear at a hearing on June 27.\nThe other point of contention is over who exactly is in charge of Henley-Young. Skinner, on the one hand, states his belief in several court documents as well as in a memorandum to Federal District Judge Daniel P. Jordan III that the Hinds County Board of Supervisors \"has usurped this Court's authority as provided by applicable statute as it relates to the detention and release of youth in Hinds County.\"\nThis is crucial because during a Nov. 3, 2014, meeting of the Hinds County Board of Supervisors, the group put forth a resolution requiring the release of young people in compliance with the consent decree. Yet, in his objections, Skinner referred to an opinion from Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood from July 2007 that stated that \"the Youth Court Judge has the legal responsibility for administering the youth detention facility.\"\n\"It is clear that the Board has total control and authority over the detention center,\" Hinds County Board of Supervisors President Darrel McQuirter said in an interview June 7.\n\"Once a facility reaches its maximum capacity, you can't add more people.\"\nBardwell maintains that it is simply not about how long the children should be in detention, but how the court approaches sentencing.\n\"The Youth Court shouldn't be in the business of sentencing children to the maximum possible sentence every time it gets the chance,\" Bardwell said.\nJudge William Skinner did not return phone calls by press time.\nEmail city reporter Tim Summers Jr. at tim@jacksonfreepress.com.

Former President Barack Obama’s Education and Justice departments told schools they must allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identities, and threatened withdrawal of education funds for those that did not comply with the non-binding guidance. The directive prompted nearly half of the states to sue.\nA Texas judge last year placed a nationwide ban on the Obama directive, halting enforcement and prompting Obama’s Justice Department to ask for the ban to be limited to just the 13 states involved in the lawsuit. But President Donald Trump’s Justice Department recently dropped the Obama request to limit the ban, suggesting that a settlement was in the works.\nAnd last week the Trump administration moved to rescind Obama’s directive entirely — and without it, the states and DOJ have nothing to fight about. In the filing Thursday, the Justice Department said it's withdrawing the appeal of the nationwide ban, and the states indicated they'll soon withdraw their suit.\nBut the settlement does not affect other litigation related to transgender student rights, such as a case that is due for oral arguments before the Supreme Court later this month involving Gavin Grimm, a transgender Virginia student who is suing his school district to be able to use a bathroom consistent with his gender identity.

There is no greater example of that connection than climate change-related displacement caused by slow-onset disasters.\nThe world will see more frequent and more devastating natural disasters as the effects of climate change intensify. This includes both rapid-onset disasters, such as hurricanes, and slow-onset disasters such as long-term droughts and famines. Slow-onset climate change impacts are often not apparent until it is too late, and they will increasingly disrupt the lives of rural people in the global south, especially the poor, women and children.\nRight now, there are 1.4 million children at risk of death from malnutrition, due in part to severe drought caused primarily by climate change. According to United Nations estimates, nearly 20 million people at risk due to famine or near-famine conditions in four countries — South Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen.\nSee more related topics:\nBut slow-onset disasters have a significant and lasting impact on a host of development issues, from food security to urbanization to public health. They wreak havoc on agricultural productivity, which in turn spurs displacement and migration. But new research on land tenure and climate change-related displacement provides a number of suggestions for governments, multilateral organizations, donors, researchers and implementers that cut across disciplines and areas of focus.\nHere are four key recommendations:\n1. National governments must act to strengthen land rights for rural people dependent on the land for survival, including both female and male smallholder farmers.\nBy taking forward-looking and innovative steps to strengthen land rights of rural people, national governments can improve individual, household and community resilience to changing climate conditions. Empowering those who live and work on the land with secure rights will help to foster flexible adaptation strategies and incentivize investments to sustain production.\nGovernments might also prioritize the adoption of resettlement policies based on international best practices in order to reduce conflict related to displacement caused by climate change.\n2. International organizations should target the structural inequities underlying climate change vulnerability.\nWomen living in forest communities play a crucial role in climate change mitigation and economic development in low- and middle-income countries, a new report by the Rights and Resources Initiative says. But legal frameworks granting them safe and secure tenure rights are lacking, putting countless communities at risk of increased poverty and vulnerability to land degradation. Devex gets the inside track.\nStructural issues and systemic challenges exacerbated by climate change must inform program design and implementation to alleviate its effects. The security of land tenure rights for rural people is foremost among these critical factors. For example, climate change programs could include a greater focus on improving land tenure security for women smallholder farmers as a way to strengthen community-based resilience.\n3. Donors should create long-term funding mechanisms for crucial research and pilot projects.\nIn addition to a renewed investment in projects on land tenure and community resilience to slow-onset disasters, donors should increase support to nongovernmental organizations and national governments for the design and implementation of updated national climate change strategies focused on land tenure and the most vulnerable members of society.\nFunding for partnerships that optimize the different yet complementary strengths of organizations is also vital. Integrated approaches, which aim to tackle those entrenched, intertwined inequities, should be prioritized — as opposed to traditional approaches that silo interventions in just one or two programmatic areas.\nFinally, recognizing the value of long-term investments, donors must offer extended funding mechanisms for holistic programming that may be initially difficult to measure.\n4. More research is needed.\nA recent report on human migration and climate change from the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University highlights the need for additional research. We know enough to be aware that land tenure and slow-onset climate change disasters are closely linked, but more high quality, empirical research is critical for informed policy decisions. Without it, there can be no coordinated global approach that supports people affected by climate change.\nAriong Moses, an agriculture and environment expert with One Acre Fund in Uganda, recently wrote: “We must also address the reality that rain-fed agriculture alone is no longer viable across the Horn of Africa due to climate change.” It is a shockingly vast declaration.\nGiven their urgency, it is unsurprising that governments, donors and others allocate a large percentage of resources to rapid-onset disasters. Unfortunately, it is the impacts of slow-onset disasters caused by climate change that threaten the most drastic and dire consequences. While the mitigation, adaptation, and prevention of slow-onset climate change migration and displacement requires a holistic approach, land rights provide a uniquely sustainable and innovative strategy that can engage all stakeholders.\nWhen the global development community better understands and addresses the interplay between land rights and slow-onset disasters, we all will be better able to mitigate and address climate change impacts for the betterment of people and nature.\nRead more international development news online, and subscribe to The Development Newswire to receive the latest from the world’s leading donors and decision-makers — emailed to you free every business day."},{"url":"http://hechingerreport.org/teacher-voice-trump-wants-axe-program-allowed-serve-country-highest-need-children","title":"TEACHER VOICE: Trump wants to axe the program that allowed me to serve my country and its highest-need children - The Hechinger Report","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Hechinger Report","description":"","date":"2017-06-05","full_text":"“I wish my teacher knew I don’t have a friend to play with me,” a student in my classroom wrote one year.\nThe little girl who penned those words struggled with profound shyness and anxiety that made it difficult for her to connect with her peers.\nReading those words reinforced my belief that educators are not only tasked with teaching reading and math, but also creating a classroom environment where kids feel safe and supported.\nBy the end of the school year, that shy little girl was given an award from Denver’s mayor for modeling leadership skills, showing strong character, and supporting her peers.\nThis is my fifth year as a third grade teacher in a Denver public school where nearly 90 percent of my students live below or very close to the poverty line. My journey began when I was 20. I wanted to serve my country, so I joined AmeriCorps, working at City Year, a program that places diverse teams of AmeriCorps members in urban public schools full-time.\nAs a City Year AmeriCorps member, I collaborated with teachers to provide support to students who needed it most, planned volunteer events, and ran extra-curricular activities. After giving a year of service, I left with a passion for education and a mission to become a teacher in the highest-need schools in my city.\nComprising just 0.03 percent of the federal budget, national service programs are not driving the federal deficit and should be protected — not be considered for elimination.\nMy pathway into teaching is not unique. Many AmeriCorps alumni choose to go into the education field after their service year, creating a robust and diverse supply of teachers prepared to help students achieve at high levels, grow as learners and graduate from high school, prepared for college and career success. Like me, many AmeriCorps alumni are helping to build a brighter future for all of our students.\nAmeriCorps has emerged as a critical pathway to teaching. It provides an additional assistance for those interested in becoming teachers: the Eli Segal Education Award of nearly $6,000, which can help defray the cost of earning a teaching degree. I used the education award to pay for my undergraduate degree. Later, I joined another AmeriCorps program—the Denver Teaching Residency—and used a second education award to help fund a master’s degree in education.\nAmeriCorps is the reason why I became a teacher, why I’m the type of teacher I am, why I seek to understand the realities my students face and why I prioritize building relationships with each student..\nThe White House recently released its FY18 budget request that calls for the elimination of AmeriCorps and other national service programs. Simply put, eliminating AmeriCorps would end a critical pathway into teaching and hurt students in our highest-need schools\nWe can’t afford to lose this pathway when teacher shortages are so common across the country. In Colorado, the Denver Post reported that 3,000 new teachers are needed to fill existing vacancies, but those graduating from teacher preparation programs have declined by almost 25 percent in the last five years.\nDefunding AmeriCorps would also hurt classrooms across the country. AmeriCorps and other national service members serve one out of every 10 schools across the county, and one out of every four high-need schools.\nThis year, nearly 12,000 traditional district, public charter and parochial schools receive support from national service programs.\nI know tight budgets require difficult decisions. But as an educator, I believe that the decision to defund AmeriCorps is a trade-off that we should not make if we’re committed to a successful future for our children. Comprising just 0.03 percent of the federal budget, national service programs are not driving the federal deficit and should be protected — not be considered for elimination.\nI urge members of Congress who in the past have displayed strong bipartisan support for national service to see the investment in AmeriCorps for what it is: a commitment to teachers, schools and our children. That’s an investment worth protecting – even expanding – as we consider what’s best for our students and for the future of our country.\nKyle Schwartz is a third grade teacher in Denver and a proud City Year and AmeriCorps alumna.

They refer to it in different ways -- participating in the Lord’s Supper, taking Holy Communion, celebrating the Eucharist -- and they take part in it with varying frequency. Some have a weekly observance, some a monthly, and a few “take Communion” quarterly or annually. But the vast majority of Christians, except the Quakers, the Salvation Army and a few others, include the Eucharist in their worship.\nAround the world on any given Sunday, tens of millions of Christians sip wine (or grape juice) and eat a piece of bread. They do this in response to instruction that Jesus gave. It is done differently in different traditions, to be sure. Nevertheless, it is a practice that Christians around the world share. It transcends race and ethnicity, gender and language differences. More than almost any other practice, it ties us together.\nAnd yet, the tie that binds also tears us apart. Catholics can’t worship with Lutherans around the Communion table because the doctrines of transubstantiation and consubstantiation divide them. And this is true, even though most Catholics and most Lutherans couldn’t differentiate between the two. Place the Anglicans at the table with them, and things get even more complicated. The Anglicans don’t even agree with each other, much less with the Catholics and Lutherans.\nAnd then there are the dissenting churches and their descendants, who reject such explanations as transubstantiation, consubstantiation, real presence, spiritual presence, and pneumatic presence. They hold that the ritual meal provides Christians with an opportunity to remember what Jesus did for them -- period. The other traditions would agree that the Eucharist provides that opportunity, but argue it is also an occasion for receiving grace in the present.\nI first came to faith in a tradition that saw the Lord’s Supper (that was what it was usually called) as only a memorial. I didn’t know there were other views until my sophomore year in college and, of course, I took for granted that everyone else was mistaken.\nDuring my junior year, I started attending a nearby Catholic church at the invitation of a friend. I found the liturgy helpful and beautiful. Of course, when it came time to celebrate the Eucharist, I didn’t dare go forward. I did not want to offend, and I had learned the divide between Catholics and Protestants over this practice was deep and the contention bitter.\nYears later, I was invited to speak at the funeral of a Catholic friend, which I was honored to accept. But imagine my surprise when the officiant asked me to help with Holy Communion. I told him that I would be glad to help, but I doubted whether his diocese would sanction a Protestant pastor taking -- and serving -- Holy Communion. I told him I didn’t have a problem, but I thought his church would. He just smiled.\nIf there is a theologically authentic way for those who hold transubstantiation, consubstantiation, real presence, spiritual presence or memorialist positions to come to agreement, no one has discovered it -- and maybe they don’t have to. Maybe it’s okay to disagree about what Communion means so long as we agree about what Christians do when they share it.\nWhatever else one may say about it, the Lord’s Supper was intended for people who have sworn allegiance to Jesus. However many layers of meaning the ritual holds, those who participate in it are affirming their covenant membership (“This cup is the new covenant in my blood”) with God as the people of Jesus. By doing this together, they acknowledge and encourage one another’s commitment to Jesus as Lord “until he comes” and establishes God’s kingdom.\nThose who “take Communion” -- whether in a grand Cathedral in Rome or in an underground church in China -- identify themselves to heaven and to each other as members of God’s covenant people. Some of them believe in transubstantiation, others in consubstantiation (or something else), but they all believe in Jesus. By taking part in the ritual, they renew their commitment to be his people and reaffirm their loyalty to his rule.\nI can gladly share the covenant meal with people who hold views that differ from my own, so long as they follow the same leader: Jesus.\n-- Shayne Looper is the pastor of Lockwood Community Church in Branch County (Mich.).

The Our Schools Now initiative to raise both income and sales taxes to bring in some $700 million for education was filed Tuesday with the lieutenant governor's office, the first step to getting on the 2018 ballot.\nSALT LAKE CITY — The Our Schools Now initiative to raise both income and sales taxes to bring in some $700 million for education was filed Tuesday with the lieutenant governor's office, the first step to getting on the 2018 ballot.\n\"This is such an important issue the people in the state of Utah deserve a voice in the decision whether we should fund eduction more,\" Zions Bank President and CEO Scott Anderson said at a news conference at the state Capitol.\nAnderson said he is convinced that voters \"will overwhelmingly say yes\" to the initiative, which would boost the state income tax rate from 5 percent to 5.5 percent and the state sales tax rate from 4.7 percent to 5.2 percent by 2021.\n\"Failing to significantly invest in education will jeopardize our state's economy, its vitality and the quality of life we enjoy here for generations,\" he said, because a strong workforce is necessary to stay competitive.\nFinding more money for schools is \"Utah's current economic challenge,\" said Anderson, a chairman of the initiative campaign along with Utah Jazz owner Gail Miller and retired Questar Chairman and CEO Ron Jibson.\nInformation provided by initiative supporters said the increase would mean a median household in Utah would see a $416 tax increase annually — $102 in additional sales taxes and $314 more in income taxes.\nThe money raised is estimated to be about $450 million from income taxes and $250 million from sales taxes. The bulk of the new revenue, 85 percent, would go to K-12 public schools, and 15 percent to higher education.\nNolan Karras, a former Utah House speaker and a member of the initiative's steering committee, said studies have shown tax changes over the past two decades reduced revenues for schools by $1.2 billion annually.\nHe said more than half of Utah students lack proficiency in basic subjects and the state's graduation rate trails the national average, but the state can't afford the solutions, including early intervention and additional resources for teachers.\nKarras said funding increases have only kept up with inflation and enrollment growth, leaving Utah \"still dead last in per-pupil spending, which we seem to wear as a badge of honor in this state. We seem to think that's a proud moment for us.\"\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done\nUtah Education Association President Heidi Matthews called the initiative \"an essential first step toward ensuring a permanent, long-term funding solution for education in Utah.\"\nMatthews, who was joined at the news conference by a number of teachers, said Our Schools Now is also an opportunity for Utahns \"to give voice to their values. We Utahns hold education in high regard.\"\nShe said the recent salary increases for teachers approved by a number of school districts in the state \"vividly demonstrates\" that regard, as communities recognize the need to invest in classrooms and are willing to pay for it.\nBut not all school districts can afford to solve the current teacher shortage by raising starting pay to $40,000 or more, Matthews said, leaving disparities that the initiative can help address.\nOriginally, the initiative was proposed as a 7/8th of 1 percent increase in the income tax rate and would have generated $700 million a year. As reported last week, backers decided to scale that back and added a boost in sales taxes.\nAnderson said after the news conference that initiative backers were encouraged by Gov. Gary Herbert and GOP legislative leaders to look at raising the sales tax instead because an income tax increase could hurt economic development.\nThe bank executive, however, said that's not been his experience.\n\"As I've visited with companies and individuals who are looking to move to Utah, none of them, especially the businesses, have said, 'We're not going to come because your income tax is too high,'\" he said.\nWhat they are worried about is that Utah schools aren't \"turning out sufficiently trained people\" for them to hire, Anderson said. \"If the income tax is 5 ½ percent, that won't hurt economic development, so I'm willing to support it.\"\nThe governor said in a statement he appreciates the effort by Our Schools Now.\n\"​We all agree that Utah’s students deserve a world-class education. I will continue to support an expanded tax base for education by aggressively promoting economic growth and engaging in meaningful tax reform that closes outdated loopholes,\" he said.\nBut if attempts to expand the tax base fall short, Herbert said the initiative \"preserves the option for Utah voters to choose to increase education funding via petition initiative.\"​\nLawmakers tried unsuccessfully last session to put together a tax increase package that included restoring the sales tax on food in the hopes of halting the initiative. Anderson said he believes lawmakers are still serious about tax reform.\n\"We've tried to work with them so what we're doing compliments what they're doing and in the end, we end up with more money for education,\" Anderson said. He said Our Schools Now polling showed voters prefer raising both sales and income taxes.\nFormer Democratic state senator Pat Jones, also a member of the Our Schools Now steering committee, said voters have long made it clear they're willing to pay higher taxes if the additional revenue ends up in the classroom.\nThe Legislature should be paying attention, she said. \"I think if they ignore it, it will be at their own peril. I really do. Because this is the No. 1 issue. … People realize we have to invest in our kids.\"\nSeveral groups are lining up to oppose the initiative because it calls for a tax increase, including the Utah chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a group affiliated with the nationally influential billionaire Koch brothers.\nState Director Evelyn Everton said the group will be mounting a campaign that could include TV commercials and telephone calls to urge Utahns not to support the initiative.\n\"I think that people are going to have a harder time giving that money to the government,\" Everton said, warning that a tax increase could drive away business and hurt the state's economy.\nThe Utah Taxpayers Association is also raising concerns about increasing taxes when the state is already putting billions of dollars a year into the public education system.\nThe Libertarian-leaning Libertas Institute's Michael Melendez said the state's \"corporate elite\" are relying on \"the same worn-out, disproven tax hike Band-Aid\" instead of coming up with a real change in education philosophy.\nTuesday's filing kicks off a lengthy process that starts with a review of the initiative's constitutionality and fiscal impact. Then, Our Schools Now backers will have to hold at least seven public hearings around the state.\nThey are expected to begin gathering voters' signatures on the initiative petitions in August. It will take more than 113,000 voter signatures from at least 26 of Utah's 29 state Senate districts to qualify for the November 2018 ballot.\nContributing: Ladd Egan"},{"url":"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/minority-drivers-unfairly-charged-insurance","title":"Are minority drivers being unfairly charged more for insurance?","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"PBS NewsHour","description":"A new analysis of auto insurance rates in some states found sometimes dramatic price discrepancies for predominantly minority neighborhoods that ProPublica’s Julia Angwin says can’t be explained by driving risks.

He’s in New York.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Consumer groups have long contended that drivers in predominantly minority neighborhoods are charged more for insurance premiums than drivers in predominantly white neighborhoods.\nInsurers had said that was due to a higher risk of accidents in those communities. But a new analysis by ProPublica and Consumers Union found the disparities in premiums are higher, sometimes much higher, even when the risk of an accident is essentially the same.\nThe team looked at data and more than 100,000 premiums in four states, California, Texas, Illinois and Missouri.\nJulia Angwin of the ProPublica team joins me now.\nSo, what did you do? What did you find?\nJULIA ANGWIN, ProPublica: So, what we did was, we basically tried to take a predominantly minority neighborhood and a non-minority neighborhood with the exact same insurance risk. And that is measured by how much insurance have had to pay out in claims.\nAnd we looked at the prices of the premiums in those neighborhoods and said, are they the same? And, oftentimes, what we found was, despite the fact that the payouts were the same and we had the same safe driver, that the minority neighborhood was being charged quite a bit more.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, when we say the payouts, that means the amount of money that insurance has paid in those communities for whatever accidents might have been happened.\nJULIA ANGWIN: Right. Over a five-year period, all insurers have paid, on average, this amount per car.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And what is the underlying reason for this?\nJULIA ANGWIN: Well, I don’t know actually why this disparity is taking place, but what the — what we — it raises the question about whether this pricing is fair, because insurance is supposed to be based on risk, and that’s what the industry has always said.\nBut when you look at the risk that they truly bear, which is the cost that they have to pay out for claims, you see these price disparities that can’t be explained by that risk.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Is there enough information out there to be able to make this assessment?\nJULIA ANGWIN: We were hard-pressed to get this data. We only got data from four states. We requested it from all 50 states. Only four said they collected it and would release it to us.\nAnd so we could only do this analysis there.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And these four states, are they representative of a cross-section? Because different states have different types of insurance rules, obviously different types of driving conditions.\nJULIA ANGWIN: Yes, they do.\nSo, basically, we have a nice range, because California is considered one of the most regulated states for insurance. The industries have to submit their rates to the regulators before they can issue them. Illinois, the least regulated, they don’t have to submit their rates to anybody for approval before they issue them, and it’s considered a very competitive target.\nAnd then we have two states in the middle, Missouri and Texas, with kind of basic level of regulation that is considered normal in the industry.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK.\nWe spoke to James Lynch of the insurance industry, and this is what he had to say.\nJAMES LYNCH, Chief Actuary, Insurance Information Institute: They kind of started off on the wrong foot, actually. In fact, I kind of feel sorry for them, because they spent a good year-plus, as I understand it, putting this study together.\nBut what they failed to do was, they failed to take into account that people in different neighborhoods drive differently. And because that’s the case, you have to compare those drives with a set of drivers on the premium side that drive differently. So, they really aren’t comparing like to like. They’re not making an apples-to-apples comparison.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: But a 30-year-old driver woman that is a safe driver across zip codes, across state lines, why is that not a fair comparison?\nJAMES LYNCH: Well, when they do that, what they are saying is that the only reason rates vary from one territory to another is because of the territory itself.\nBut the truth is that, in any neighborhood, some drivers are driving more miles than others. Some drivers are getting in more accidents than people in other neighborhoods. And you need to take that into account when you’re setting rates.\nAnd, as far as we can tell, they haven’t done that. And we have actually hired a firm to peer-review their work, and it looks like they’re coming to a very similar conclusion to ours.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Is there any reasoning that you can come up with for why these disparities exist from zip code to zip code?\nJAMES LYNCH: Well, as I said, if you took these on a like-to-like basis, if you looked at all of the characteristics of drivers in an area, race not being one of them, because insurance companies do not ask questions about race. In many places, it’s illegal for them to ask them about race.\nAnd they go one further. They just don’t ask, because there’s actually nothing to be gained from the exercise. And so what they do ask about is, they ask about things like the kind of car you drive, the number of miles that you drive, what your driving record is. And then, based upon those concrete variables, your rate is set.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, he takes aim at your methodology and says the conclusion is flawed.\nJULIA ANGWIN: You know, as of yet, we have not heard from anyone about any errors that are correctable that we need to correct in this, and we’re always open to hearing that.\nWe approached the industry and actually lots of academics and experts to review our methodology for months in advance. And so, as of right now, I don’t have any corrections to make to it. And I await the response that the industry said they’re going to publish soon.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, the insurance industry says, you know, it’s not apples to apples to compare the same person at the same age with the same driving record because different people in different communities drive differently.\nThere’s just a much larger pool to compare.\nJULIA ANGWIN: So, the insurance industry has a way of dealing with the problem you’re describing, which is that they assign territories different risk ratings. And those are what these insurance quotes are based on.\nSo, when we’re analyzing the quotes that they give to each person, that’s based on their own assessment of the riskiness of that neighborhood. And what we’re doing is comparing that to the payouts that they made in that neighborhood.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Why does this all matter at the end of the day?\nJULIA ANGWIN: Why this matters is that this is just one of many areas of life where you see minority neighborhoods being treated disparately.\nAnd there’s an explanation out there that says, oh, it’s because it’s so risky, and, basically, it’s deserved, right? They’re paying higher prices, but it’s because it’s a dangerous neighborhood.\nAnd this just raises the question, which is, once again, that the facts don’t support that analysis. The facts don’t show that these neighborhoods are riskier than the ones that are getting cheaper prices, in most cases.\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Julia Angwin of ProPublica, thanks for joining us.\nJULIA ANGWIN: Thank you so much."},{"url":"http://khn.org/news/cuts-in-federal-housing-help-would-hurt-peoples-health-research-suggests","title":"Cuts In Federal Housing Help Would Hurt People’s Health, Research Suggests","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Kaiser Health News","description":"A study in Health Affairs shows that people who receive federal housing vouchers and other forms of public housing assistance are more likely to have health insurance and get regular medical care.","date":"2017-06-05","full_text":"Does investing in public housing keep people healthier?\nNew research explores this question, which appears timely, especially as the Trump administration proposes to cut $7.4 billion — about 15 percent — from the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s budget, and HUD Secretary Ben Carson argues that too much government assistance fosters dependency and perpetuates cycles of poverty.\nThe study, published Monday in the journal Health Affairs, found that receiving housing assistance from the federal government — through vouchers, public housing and subsidies for so-called multifamily homes — also increased people’s likelihood of having health insurance and access to regular care. These findings add to a growing body of evidence that suggests stable housing — in particular, the kind of federal housing assistance now on the chopping block — could help its recipients better manage their health.\n“This income boost people are getting through housing assistance can free up scarce resources to be spent on other things,” said Andrew Fenelon, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health and one of the paper’s authors. “We haven’t had [before] this clear evidence that these housing assistance programs … actually lead to improved health.”\nTo figure this out, the researchers used a nationally representative sample of non-elderly, non-disabled adults surveyed from 2004 to 2012. Using data collected by HUD, they checked whether people with housing assistance got insurance and medical care. Those responses were then compared with responses to the same survey given by people who did not have housing at the time of the survey but qualified within two years — respondents with presumably similar life circumstances.\nThe findings: Of people who received federal aid, about 31.8 percent lacked health insurance, compared with about 37.2 percent of those who would later qualify. People with aid were also more likely to get medical care when needed.\nAs policymakers consider both health care and housing, that link suggests investing in these assistance programs could yield benefits on both fronts. Lawmakers are already looking for ways to improve access to health insurance and care. But the Trump administration’s proposed HUD budget, experts say, would result in $1.8 billion in cuts for public housing — an area some worry is already under-resourced — and could eliminate about 250,000 housing vouchers. The budget has already elicited criticism from both sides of the aisle — with multiple Republican senators calling it “dead on arrival” — but, some say, it could generally indicate policy areas that are most vulnerable in the administration.\n“The cuts that are proposed in the budget will mean more people are struggling to find affordable and stable housing,” said Elizabeth Kneebone, a fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program. “This study suggests that can also have effects on other things, like access to health care and health insurance.”\nMartha Weatherspoon, an Avon sales representative in Clarksville, Tenn., understands this reality. Weatherspoon, 54, has lived in public housing since 1997. If the proposed funding cuts happen, she would have to move to Florida, she said. There, she has family and thinks she would have better luck finding something affordable.\nWeatherspoon said relocating is an option because she no longer has to provide housing or health insurance for anyone else. Her only child is now an adult, with her own home and income. But many of her neighbors, who work minimum-wage jobs and have families, don’t have this flexibility. They rely on these subsidies.\nWithout that aid, “you’re talking anywhere from $600 to $1,500, depending on things like the size of the bedroom,” she said. “The number of hours you would have to work … just to pay the rent — it’s costly.”\nThe funding cuts would not just crowd out people’s budgets for health insurance and care, Kneebone said, they would stoke the need for those very services. If people don’t have a regular, stable home to go to — or if that home isn’t properly maintained — they can become sicker, physically and mentally.\nAnd federal allocations to public housing and housing assistance have shrunk in recent years, so public housing already faces issues when it comes to regular upkeep. Meanwhile, research increasingly suggests where one lives influences health and health needs.\nFor instance, Weatherspoon’s daughter is asthmatic, a condition that may have been exacerbated by the quality of their housing — a unit more than 60 years old that, to her recollection, has not been renovated while she has lived there.\n“A lot of folks in public housing — the kids do have a medical condition,” she said. Many homes, she added, have black mold in the walls, which is toxic. If the government puts even less into maintaining public housing than what’s already put in, she asked, “will it be safe?”\nThe result is a double bind of sorts, Fenelon said. Just when people have fewer free dollars to pay for health care, their health worsens — meaning their need for care is even greater.\n“Providing housing for people isn’t just a housing issue. It’s an issue of health and well-being,” Fenelon said. “To the extent that the new budget passes and leads to people losing their housing assistance, we’re also talking about people losing their health care.”"},{"url":"http://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/30/bill-would-decriminalize-possessing-small-amounts-marijuana-wisconsin/355635001","title":"Bill would decriminalize possessing small amounts of marijuana in Wisconsin","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Post-Crescent Media","description":"Lawmakers unveiled a bill Tuesday to decriminalize marijuana possession but acknowledged their effort won't go far.","date":"","full_text":"Buzz60\nMADISON – A Republican and three Democrats unveiled a bill Tuesday that would decriminalize possessing small amounts of marijuana, but quickly acknowledged the bill's grim fate in a GOP-controlled Legislature.\n“I’m not naive to think that we are going to probably pass this and get it signed into law,\" said Rep. Adam Jarchow (R-Balsam Lake), one of the bill's sponsors.\nBy introducing legislation that is likely to die, the lawmakers hope they can also build public support for the bill they say would save taxpayers money and keep people who commit minor offenses out of jail.\nThe bill would set a fine of $100 for possessing up to 10 grams of marijuana.

A second possession offense can be treated as a felony.\nJarchow noted first-offense drunken driving is not a crime, but holding “a couple of joints could land you in a jail or in prison.”\nThe bill would also save money.

Beginning May 8, the Environmental Protection Agency dismissed nine members of its 18-person board of scientific counselors, which is supposed to scrutinize the integrity of the agency’s research. Around the same time, the Interior Department suspended 200 advisory boards, many of which allow citizens to make recommendations on natural resource management.\nGovernment spokespeople have said these decisions aim to bring the agencies in line with goals of the new administration. Yet the moves have instigated intense outcry from members of the wider scientific community who say the administration is blocking input on federal decision-making. “This is part of a larger effort to undermine the role that science plays in our federal government,” said Genna Reed, policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, noting that the administration has also removed climate data from federal websites, frozen grant processes for scientists, and failed to make key scientific appointments, such as in the Office of Science and Technology. Interior’s freeze of advisory councils has concerned Westerners in particular, who depend on them to give public input on contentious natural resource management decisions.\nThe dismissal of half the members of the EPA’s Board of Scientific Counselors earlier this month reflects the Trump administration’s allegiance to business and industry over scientific rigor, critics say. Two members of a subcommittee of the board have resigned in protest. EPA spokesman J.P. Freire said members of regulated industries will be considered as replacements; those industries include oil, gas and mineral development.\n“In my experience of 15 years on and off of EPA boards, I have not seen (this) before,” board chair Deborah Swackhamer, who chairs the board, told High Country News. “When an individual is not renewed, there is usually a compelling reason, such as a conflict of interest with upcoming work, or their expertise is not needed. But that was not the case here.\nThe Board of Scientific Counselors plays a critical role when it comes to the integrity of the science that environmental regulations are based on. The board was created in 1996 to ensure that EPA researchers adhered to scientific standards; the group reviews research results before the agency uses them to develop regulations. “The West has some really important issues that interface with EPA science, like oil and gas development, water quality concerns, mining legacy, Superfund sites and tribal environmental health issues,” Utah State University natural resource sociologist Courtney Flint said. She was one of those dismissed from the board, which is traditionally composed of academics from a wide variety of backgrounds, as well as representatives from non-governmental organizations who have scientific expertise. Scientists from regulated industries are not prohibited from the board or its subcommittees, though all members go through a rigorous vetting process that includes financial and conflict of interest disclosures.\nThe board also reviews EPA science that the agency uses to build practical tools and provide advice for local communities responding to environmental disasters. In the case of an oil spill, for example, Flint said, “Local first responders might be looking for the right products to be using for different contaminants in different kinds of water or soils.”\nAnother role of the board is to help ensure that EPA scientific models take into consideration the lives and values of people, rather than just environmental factors. This is important for Western communities that identify culturally with extractive industries, Flint said. “If you just eliminate any environmental process (like mining) that could be at all problematic, you may take away the livelihood of people and their identities and you may change the landscape in a way that would not be sustainable in the broad way of thinking about it.” As a natural resource sociologist, Flint has encouraged the EPA to expand definitions of sustainability to include factors such as how community members connect socially or how they relate to their environment.\nGiven the circumstances, the dismissals don’t seem that out of the ordinary, John Deutch, a chemist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former chair of dozens of agency committees, told E\u0026ENews. “I would think it’s not unusual for all the members to resign in a changing of administration,” he said. Yet Swackhamer, Flint and other board members say it’s unusual because most members serve out two three-year terms despite changes in administration, while these nine scientists were let go after just one term. Among them were a national security expert who is CEO of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; a senior engineer at the California Energy Commission; a professor of mineral engineering; and a professor of agricultural air quality. Michigan State University ecological economist Robert Richardson, another of the dismissed, said: “I’ve never heard of any circumstance where someone didn’t serve two consecutive terms.”\nIn addition to the en masse changeover on the scientific board of counselors, another EPA board that advises the agency on research and scientific integrity may see a major overhaul. House Bill 1431, introduced by Rep. Lucas Frank, R-Okla., in March, would exclude current or recent recipients of EPA grant funding from holding positions on that board. Such a move could tip the balance of the 47-member panel, created in 1978, away from scientists and toward business and industry representatives.\nThe Department of Interior has also moved to bar outside input on federal policy. This month, Interior suspended 200 advisory boards and commissions until at least September. The freeze includes 38 resource advisory councils, known as RACs, which allow members of the public to provide recommendations on grazing, mining and recreation to the Bureau of Land Management. Juan Palma, who served in the BLM during the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations, told High Country News he had never seen such a freeze. “I hope there is some explanation as to why,” he said.\nRACs, which are usually composed of 10 to 15 members, make formal recommendations to the BLM on topics ranging from wildlife conservation to grazing rights and off-road vehicle access. Established in 1995, they are required to include representatives from a wide array of interests. RACs are one of the most direct avenues for public input on resource management. “Normally the BLM cannot sit in council with the mining industry or grazing or environmental (interests),” Palma said. “But they can sit in council with a RAC.” The councils can have real clout with the agency, he said. Utah BLM’s policies on remote road closures were largely influenced by recommendations from a RAC several years ago, he said. In Nevada, a BLM wild horse contraception program was based on a proposal by RAC members.\nOn May 11, eight senators sent a letter to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, criticizing the RAC suspension. “It is critical that local voices, including RACs, have the opportunity to provide input and take part in the process at all times, not just when those local voices align with the Administration or a large special interest,” the letter reads. The senators also say the suspension could cause Oregon RAC’s to miss deadlines for federal funding for projects to promote forest health and create local jobs.\nOne of the biggest concerns with the RAC suspension, according to public-lands supporters, is the fact that it coincides with Trump’s executive order to review dozens of national monuments and determine whether to adjust or abolish them. “It would have been a great chance for us to come together as a balanced group and to talk about (Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument) and perhaps provide BLM with perspective,” said Phil Hanceford, Wilderness Society assistant director of agency policy and planning, who sits on the RAC for the monument.\nThe only explanation Interior has provided for the freeze is a statement that reads, in part: “The Secretary is committed to restoring trust in the Department’s decision-making and that begins with institutionalizing state and local input and ongoing collaboration, particularly in communities surrounding public lands.” HCN requested more details as to the reasons for the suspension, but an Interior spokesman declined to provide any.\nWhen considered together, the EPA dismissals and the RAC suspensions appear to be two pieces of the same puzzle. Without science and diverse public input, industries could become the government’s primary advisors on protecting the environment, natural resource economies and human health. “If we don’t have (outside) review,” said Utah State’s Courtney Flint, “then we miss out on the democratic process of keeping tabs on what’s happening in the federal agencies.”\nTay Wiles is an associate editor at High Country News and can be reached at taywiles@hcn.org.

After all, it’s the land of fondue, delicious chocolate, and getting tipsy on mountaintops. What’s not to like?\nEven the research community supports Switzerland’s idyllic image. The country has consistently been either the first or the second happiest country in the World Happiness Report, which incorporates factors like GDP per capita, life expectancy, and perception of corruption.\nIn other words, the Swiss’ reputation as a joyous country isn’t a fluke; they’re genuinely doing something right. Why are Swiss people so happy? What are they doing right? And does the happiness come at a cost?\nCommunity at the Core\nThere’s a stereotype that the Swiss are all about punctuality– and I can confirm that it’s true. Once I left the airport in Zurich, I had braced myself for dealing with bad public transportation. (I’m used to the nightmare that is the New York subway system.) But to my surprise, every train arrived exactly on time. Between three transfers, I never had to wait more than five minutes for a train.\nAt first, this might just seem like the Swiss have great public transit. And while that’s true, their transportation reveals their deeper respect of community.\nAfter my trip, I talked to Jeff Wilson, the host of Real Rail Adventures on Public TV, about the significance of the Swiss public transit system. “The Swiss regularly vote for public works that don’t pay for themselves…like their extremely extensive public transportation system,” Wilson said. “The Swiss see public transportation as a right, so they’ve merged their postal system with a bus system that ensures no one in the country has to walk more than 10 minutes to get to public transportation.”\nThis attitude expands into their generous welfare and healthcare programs, both of which are amongst some of the best in the world. According to Forbes’ Avik Roy, the Swiss government spent 2.7 percent of its GDP on healthcare. For comparison, the U.S. spent 7.4 percent of its GDP in 2008. Despite this disparity, the Swiss have universal coverage for all citizens, comparably low wait times for appointments, and access to the latest technology. Their welfare system, meanwhile, provides for basic living costs, housing, and health insurance.\nThe Swiss emphasis on community doesn’t just come from their welfare system; it also stems from their mandatory military service. Every male citizen between the ages of 18 to 34 must participate in military training for 18 to 21 weeks. There is also an option to perform civil service work, which includes nature conservation, humanitarian aid, and assistance in natural disasters.\nAn employee at a hotel in Gstaad told me about his time in the medical unit of the Swiss military. While there, he learned how to use costume makeup to create fake wounds that others would pretend to heal. He acknowledged how silly the anecdote sounds, and that his time in the service can sound like adult summer camp. But he insisted that the experience made him feel closer to his country and community– and he wouldn’t trade that for anything.\n“Part of that (love of country) comes from the mandatory public service all Swiss must engage in while they’re young,” Wilson said. “When you serve others while you’re young, becoming a part of something larger than yourself, you learn a kind of humility that stays with you your whole life.”\nSweaty and Smiling\nWhile the world is dealing with an obesity epidemic, the Swiss are a generally trim people. In fact, Swiss women have the lowest BMIs in Europe. From what I’ve observed, that’s generally because a healthy diet and physical fitness are emphasized to the Swiss children from day one. As one of my tour guides told me, “Swiss children are on skis right after they learn to walk. It’s what we do here.”\nPhysical activity is emphasized from a young age. For example, the schools in Gstaad have mandatory sports, which means that the streets are constantly filled with adorable kids in skiing gear. This mentality transfers into adulthood. Chantal Panozzo observes this in a piece she wrote about her experience living in Switzerland: “If it’s summer, jumping into the lake to swim with the swans is an acceptable way to spend your lunch hour. If you eat a sandwich at your desk, people will scold you.”\nA Fear of Diversity\nDespite all of this happiness, Switzerland undoubtedly has its social issues, such as the lack of diversity. Because of a law called Durchsetzungsinitiativ, any foreigner who is convicted of two minor offenses within ten years can be automatically deported. These can be as small as traffic violations. (Edited to add: While this proposal was refused by 58.9% of voters, it highlights the fear that some Swiss have of outsiders.)\nThis policy highlights the intolerance that some Swiss have for anyone who is not “traditionally Swiss.” A lot of the time, this means that they’re a person of color. The below poster, which is in favor of keeping Durchsetzungsinitiativ, perfectly illustrates the fear that some Swiss have of those who are different.\nOf the two million foreigners in Switzerland, 1.6 million are of European origin. “Probably the biggest challenge facing migrants is integrating into Swiss living,” Zurich resident and expat, Cynthia Luna, told me. “The Swiss are a culturally reserved and risk-averse people. Newcomers are unaware of the numerous unspoken codes of conduct and will not know if they made a social faux pas.”\nCynthia’s point resonated with me. Throughout my entire time in Switzerland, I didn’t notice anyone who I would classify as distinctly “different.” The one person who remotely stood out from the crowd was a really drunk woman singing karaoke at a hotel bar. (And even then, she was a white lady who looked immaculate in an expensive outfit, complete with diamonds.) Because of the lack of foreigners in the country, there’s a very noticeable lack of diversity. Throughout my five days in the country, I only noticed one person of color. This makes sense — in 2002, only 0.6% of the country’s population was black. The CIA’s World Fact Book states that the country’s ethnicities are divided into German, French, Italian, Romansch, and “other.”\nIt’s tempting to correlate Switzerland’s lack of diversity with its levels of happiness. And it’s likely true, to an extent, that people feel more comfortable around people who look like them — though the global consequences of that are frightening.\nYet there’s another way to think about the issue. Behavioral researcher Jared Boyles believes the Swiss must strive “to change [their] fundamental ideas of what it means to be homogeneous in the first place.” In other words, are there ways people can find areas of common ground, even if they don’t look alike?\nWhile Switzerland has a poor track record with diversity, it still offers important lessons in being civically minded and physically active. Meanwhile, the “happiest country in the world” might learn how to extend their joy to people who might not, at the outset, fit the traditional notion of what it means to be Swiss.\nThe Development Set is made possible by funding from the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation.

When purchasing clothes, consumers may not be aware that they are often contributing to the exploitation of garment workers and supporting nonsustainable practices.\nIdentifying specific manufacturers for clothing companies is the goal of a new campaign from Labour Behind the Label, a U.K.-based network that advocates for garment workers’ rights. The campaign,“Fix Fashion: Information Is Power,” hopes to pressure brands to publish audit reports and the names and addresses of their supplier factories. The group hopes that disclosing supplier information will not only hold companies accountable to ensure workers rights, but will also allow the public to understand the conditions the workers making their clothes are subjected to.\nFactory owners at the Rana Plaza were aware of the dangerous conditions of their facilities and allowed employees to continue working, resulting in the disaster. Families seeking compensation from the clothing brands who used these manufacturers were put on hold due to an inability to identify which retailers were using which factories. Only when labels were picked out of the rubble were families able to identify which companies were liable.\n“Consumers have more power than they think. If a store manager has their shoppers asking questions about where their clothes are being sourced, we think they are more likely to listen,” Caroline Lewis, director of fundraising for Labour Behind the Label, wrote in an email to TakePart. “In an industry where garment companies pocket huge profits whilst workers are being exploited at the bottom of supply chains, we want brands to listen to those who produce and buy their clothes.”\nAsking a question as simple as “Who is making my clothes?” takes into consideration how workers are being treated, where materials are coming from, and whether or not your clothing has been made sustainably. On average, garment workers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and India receive 70 cents an hour for their 12-hour work days and live in poverty. Publishing supplier lists is one way to help consumers start shopping responsibly and improve conditions for garment workers.\n“Some brands are publishing a list of the places where their clothes are made, which shows some promising progress for monitoring human rights,” Sarah Ditty of Fashion Revolution, a global movement that exposes child labor and sweatshop abuses, wrote in an email to TakePart. “Despite all this, most brands do not publish factory lists due to competitive concerns, so there is a long way to go, and campaigns like this will help put pressure on companies to do more.”\nLabour Behind the Label is raising funds to support its efforts through a crowdfunding campaign. The approximately $4,500 it hopes to raise by Dec. 19 will enable the organization to train activists and lobby for greater transparency in the fashion industry.\n“If brands publish the list of their supplier factories, with audit reports of those factories, it will allow workers to claim their rights,” Lewis wrote. “If workers have access to audit reports, showing whether a brand’s Code of Conduct is being met, it will support them in their negotiations with factories to improve safety conditions, wages or union rights.”"},{"url":"http://www.newsminer.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/consider-pre-existing-conditions-in-health-bill/article_a0b78530-473f-11e7-89c2-630276c62fa8.html","title":"Consider pre-existing conditions in health bill","author_text":"Marcy Nadel/Fairbanks","keywords":["Letters To Editor"],"publication_text":"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner","description":"News-Miner letter to the editor:","date":"","full_text":"News-Miner letter to the editor:\nMay 25, 2017\nTo the editor: The Congressional Budget Office assessment of the American Health Care Act finally came out, nearly three weeks after Rep.

Rarely do I come across one with the consistent new paradigm frame, historical depth, practical sensibility, systemic analysis, and readability of Doughnut Economics by Kate Raworth. Especially unique and valuable is her carefully reasoned, illustrated, and documented debunking of the fatally flawed theory behind economic policies that drive financial instability, environmental collapse, poverty, and extreme inequality.\nDoughnut Economics opens with the story of an Oxford University student. Recognizing the inseparable connection between the economy and the environmental and social issues of our time, she did what many students with such concerns do. She signed up for an economics major hoping to learn how she might contribute to creating a better world.\nWhat she learned instead is that the theory taught in textbook economics is hopelessly simplistic and largely irrelevant to her concerns—and to those of many of her fellow students. Rather than just shift to a more relevant major, however, she started what has become a spreading global student movement demanding reform of university economics curricula.\nOn a fast track to becoming one of the world’s most influential economists, Raworth has produced a book that more than validates the reasons for the student revolt. She fills in yawning gaps in current textbook economic theory to make the connections for which these students—and many of the rest of us—are looking.\nRaworth takes us step by step through the basic concepts taught in standard economics texts and courses. It is a journey down a rabbit hole into an Alice in Wonderland fantasy world of irrationally simplistic assumptions in which the human players are all independent actors with perfectly selfish motives and perfect knowledge. The market mediates their spending and investment choices to meet the needs of all the players and optimize outcomes for everyone.\nRaworth points out that models of fantasy-world economics include no society and no nature.\nTherefore, social and environmental issues enter into consideration only as externalities—which to an economist means irrelevant to the analysis—an indication of how unimportant academic economists consider them to be. Focused on self-contained circular flows of goods and money, they take no interest in flows of energy, nutrients, water, materials, and information. They ignore institutions, power, inequality, and Earth’s physical limits. They even ignore financial institutions, which explains why economists failed to predict the 2008 financial crash that threatened to bring down the entire global economy.\nFor more than a century, these simplistic assumptions have shielded professionally trained economists from dealing with the breathtakingly dynamic complexity of economic reality.\nRaworth illuminates this complexity with a simple doughnut-shaped diagram that radically recasts the economy’s nature and function to align with reality.\nThe outer circle of the doughnut represents the productive limits of Earth’s generative systems—the ecological ceiling that the human economy must not exceed.\nThe inner circle represents the social foundation of what a high-performing economy must provide for every one of Earth’s 7 billion-plus people.\nIn between the two circles—the substance of the doughnut—is the regenerative and distributive economy, with all its complex and dynamic living-system relationships among interdependent actors and institutions with often conflicting interests, motives, and mandates—all dependent on the generative systems of a living Earth.\nThis is the real-world economy for a living Earth that we must learn to structure and manage to provide a just and safe space for humanity. For a more complete overview of the doughnut, I recommend viewing Raworth’s 17-minute TEDx talk .\nRaworth’s analysis makes clear that the foundational structure of standard economics is flawed beyond repair. At each step, she frames essential alternatives with concrete examples.\nDoughnut Economics provides both the nail in the coffin of standard economics and the real-world-based intellectual structure from which an authentic real-world economics for the 21st century can grow. For anyone contemplating signing up for a standard economics course or degree to help them solve real-world problems, I highly recommend buying and reading Doughnut Economics instead.

Here’s the sign-up.)\nA company’s vision to pump water from the Mojave Desert and sell it to thirsty Southern California cities had looked to some to be a long shot.\nCadiz Inc., which owns about 50 square miles atop a major aquifer in the Cadiz Valley, has pushed proposals to tap the water since the 1990s. The latest iteration has been mired for years in a thicket of regulatory and legal hurdles.\nBut a series of developments has invigorated backers of the project, which involves both federal and state jurisdictions.\n• In January, the Trump transition team included Cadiz on a “priority list” of projects.\n• In March, the White House rescinded two policy memos that had been used to subject plans for a pipeline to costly environmental reviews.\n• And in April, David Bernhardt, a lobbyist who has worked on behalf of Cadiz, was nominated for the No. 2 spot at the Interior Department.\nInvestors appear to have taken note. Last month, Cadiz announced up to $255 million in new funding.\nEnvironmental groups and some lawmakers, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, have warned that the Cadiz plan could wipe out springs that sustain desert plants and wildlife.\n“We’re very concerned right now,” said Frazier Haney, conservation director of the Mojave Desert Land Trust, a nonprofit.\nMr. Haney said pumping in the Mojave could permanently damage the groundwater basin through subsidence, or sinking of the ground. “Once we break it, we can’t get it back,” he added.\nA major point of contention between the two sides is whether the aquifer would be naturally recharged in equilibrium with the water being removed. The science is fiercely disputed.\nCadiz wants to pump 50,000 acre-feet of water a year over the next half-century, enough to sustain about 100,000 homes and earn the company more than than $1 billion in revenue.\nSupporters, including a number of state lawmakers, say environmental reviews and court tests have shown the project to be sound.\n“It’s an environmentally benign project,” said Dan Ferons, general manager of Santa Margarita Water District, the lead public agency on the Cadiz project.\nFaced with recurring drought, he added, California can’t afford to refuse new water sources.\nSome water experts say projects like Cadiz offer only incremental relief and distract from what should be the focus: conservation.\n“It just seems like somebody trying to make money,” said Jay R. Lund, head of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis.\nTo solve our water dilemma, he added, we should look to cities in places like Spain and Israel, where per capita water use has been cut to as little as a quarter of those in California.\n(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\n• California senators provided some of the most memorable exchanges during the James B.

Lunchtime vegetable offerings were given different labels on different days. For example, on one day diners could choose “dynamite chili and tangy lime-seasoned beets.” On other days the same item was labeled “lighter-choice beets with no added sugar,” ”high antioxidant beets,” or simply “beets.”\nAlmost one-third of the nearly 28,000 diners chose a vegetable offering during the study. The tasty-sounding offering was the most popular, selected by about 220 diners on average on days it was offered, compared with about 175 diners who chose the simple-label vegetable. The healthy-sounding labels were the least popular.\nDiners also served themselves bigger portions of the tasty-sounding vegetables than of the other choices.\nTurnwald emphasized that “there was no deception” — all labels accurately described the vegetables, although diners weren’t told that the different-sounding choices were the exact same item.\nThe results illustrate “the interesting advantage to indulgent labeling,” he said.\nDr. Stephen Cook, a University of Rochester childhood obesity researcher, called the study encouraging and said some high school cafeterias have also tried different labels to influence healthy eating.\n“It shouldn’t be a surprise to us because marketing people have been doing this for years,” Cook said.\n___\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at http://www.twitter.com/LindseyTanner and her work can be found at http://tinyurl.com/kv4uhoh"},{"url":"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/06/12/523774660/a-drugmaker-tries-to-cash-in-on-the-opioid-epidemic-one-state-law-at-a-time","title":"A Drugmaker Tries To Cash In On The Opioid Epidemic, One State Law At A Time","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"NPR.org","description":"The maker of one medical treatment for opioid abuse has successfully lobbied statehouses around the country to pass policies that tilt addiction treatment practices in favor of the company's drug.","date":"","full_text":"Two years ago, a mental health advocate named Steve McCaffrey stood at a lectern in the Indiana statehouse, testifying in favor of an addiction treatment bill. After years of rising overdose rates, lawmakers in the health committee were taking action to combat the opioid epidemic. And they often turned to McCaffrey, who leads Mental Health America of Indiana, to advise them.\nHis brief testimony appeared straightforward. \"We rise in support, urge your adoption,\" said McCaffrey. He said the legislation would move the state \"toward evidence-based treatment.\"\nBut the bill wouldn't do that. Instead, it would cement rules making it harder to access certain addiction medications — medications that many patients rely on. The goal was to steer doctors toward a specific brand-name drug: Vivitrol.\nThe drug is a monthly shot used to treat alcohol and opioid addiction and one of a handful of FDA-approved treatments for addiction to opioids such as pain relievers, heroin and fentanyl.\nState Rep. Steve Davisson, the bill's sponsor, says McCaffrey helped write the bill, one of many related to addiction treatment that McCaffrey has worked on since 2015. But there was something important that Davisson and other lawmakers didn't know about him.\nState lobbying records show that McCaffrey lobbies for Alkermes, the company that makes Vivitrol.\nAsked earlier this year whether Indiana lawmakers knew about his lobbying for Alkermes, McCaffrey said, \"I imagine some do and some don't.\" But several lawmakers who have worked closely with McCaffrey, including Davisson, say they were not aware.\nHis efforts have helped turn Indiana into what Alkermes describes in investor documents as an \"up-and-coming\" state, where the drug's sales are poised to jump dramatically.\nMcCaffrey's work promoting Vivitrol via legislation in Indiana is part of a larger pattern. An investigation by NPR and Side Effects Public Media has found that in statehouses across the country, and in Congress, Alkermes is pushing Vivitrol while contributing to misconceptions and stigma about other medications used to treat opioid addiction.\nWhile policymakers are grasping for solutions to the nation's opioid epidemic, Alkermes, which has its U.S. headquarters in Waltham, Mass., is using policy to promote its drug and, in some cases, hamper access to medications that can help. And in so doing, it's looking to turn its drug into a blockbuster.\nScience vs. stigma\nThere's growing urgency among state policymakers to fight the addiction epidemic. The number of opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 1999 to 2015. In that year, an average of 91 people died per day. There are now more deaths from overdoses in the U.S. than from car accidents. Opioids cause most of them.\nBut those looking for large-scale solutions to the crisis must navigate diverging views on treatment, making them receptive to lobbyists who attempt to guide them through medically complex and emotionally charged territory. Among those devoted to helping people addicted to opioids, there are conflicting opinions about the role of medications in recovery.\nMedical researchers emphasize that the proven standard in addiction treatment includes medication, preferably combined with counseling and other behavioral and social support. The research shows that medication-assisted treatment helps prevent relapse and save lives. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration and professional medical organizations all recommend medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction.\nBut others disagree with the very concept of using medicine to treat addiction. Though this contradicts medical consensus, some, especially those with a background in the 12-step movement, view it as simply trading reliance on one drug for another. Addiction is a moral or spiritual problem to be overcome by willpower or faith, some believe. Medication is a crutch.\nTwo of the medications used to treat opioid addiction receive the most scrutiny, because they're opioids themselves: methadone and buprenorphine, which is known as Suboxone, a brand-name formulation. Both medicines, called opioid-maintenance therapy, reduce cravings and prevent withdrawal, helping people to avoid the harmful behaviors associated with addiction.\n\"If the addiction is the monster, then methadone and Suboxone cage the monster,\" says Dr. Andy Chambers, an addiction psychiatrist in Indianapolis. In a proper treatment setting, people with an existing tolerance to opioids don't get a feeling of euphoria from opioid maintenance drugs because of how they're formulated and administered.\nStill, many people, including lawmakers, law enforcement and corrections officials, see lurking risks in any substance with street value — any substance that activates the opioid receptors in the brain. As a result, methadone and buprenorphine are two of the most heavily regulated drugs in America, even more than the highly addictive painkillers that have touched off the addiction crisis.\nThe third medication, Vivitrol, sidesteps much of the debate. Approved to treat opioid addiction in 2010, Vivitrol is a monthly injection of extended-release naltrexone. It is not an opioid. Instead, it blocks opioid receptors in the brain.\nVivitrol is effective for some patients, but like the other two medications, it's not the right choice for everyone. For example, it's not ideal for patients who are dealing with chronic pain on top of their addiction, or for pregnant women. It's also more expensive than opioid maintenance — around $1,000 a shot. And it requires patients to stop using opioids and go through a painful detox before they can begin taking it.\nThat thought can deter people from beginning treatment. \"The opioids hijack that part of your brain that has to do with survival,\" says Dr. Camila Arnaudo, an addiction psychiatrist in Bloomington, Ind. \"The idea of being off of them ... is tantamount to telling them you're going to take away their food or the air they breathe.\"\nSome clinicians are also hesitant to prescribe Vivitrol to patients because of relapse risk. Using opioids again after an extended period of opioid abstinence can increase the risk of overdose and death.\nThat Vivitrol has no street value and no potential for abuse has helped the drug shake some of the skepticism directed toward medication-assisted treatment. For the last several years, the company has marketed the drug heavily to people in the criminal justice system, convincing judges and corrections officials to offer Vivitrol to inmates and parolees.\nBut there hasn't been as much research on Vivitrol's long-term effectiveness compared to methadone and buprenorphine, partly because it's a newer drug.\nA billion-dollar drug?\nAlkermes is open about its basic strategy — influencing legislators and officials to increase sales of Vivitrol.\n\"We have an entire team of people fanned out across the country working from coast to coast with state and local government officials,\" said Jeff Harris, the company's government affairs director, at an investor event in September 2016.\nIn a presentation, Harris described Alkermes' lobbying strategy as \"ecosystem development\" — raising awareness and promoting policies favorable to Vivitrol. Alkermes has poured money into the political process. In 2010 they spent less than $200,000 on federal lobbying; in 2016 they spent $4.4 million, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. Alkermes has also been spending aggressively at the state level and has been a generous campaign contributor.\nHarris showed the crowd a map of the U.S. that showed Vivitrol programs in most states; he said sales are increasing because of the company's work.\nAt that event, Alkermes displayed a chart that showed sales of Vivitrol and ranked states on how friendly they are to its product — and how high each state's overdose rate is. The chart shows circles of varying sizes representing the quantity of overdose deaths in state per 100,000 people.\nAlkermes is a niche player in the pharmaceutical industry, and Vivitrol is central to the company's growth plans. Although the drug was first approved to treat alcohol addiction in 2006, it wasn't until the company began marketing Vivitrol to law enforcement and policymakers that sales took off. Last year, Vivitrol's sales reached $209 million — up from just $30 million in 2011. Some of that money comes directly from the federal and state governments, through Medicaid and other programs that help people pay for addiction treatment.\nIn the presentation, Alkermes said sales could reach $1 billion by 2021.\nAt the 2016 investor event, CEO Richard Pops suggested that among pharmaceutical companies, Alkermes is unique. \"We find ourselves really deeply dedicated to bringing in new medicines to patients and profoundly affecting their lives, the lives of their families and even the communities that they live in,\" he said.\nBut a number of people working in the field of addiction policy are concerned about their tactics.\n\"In a number of states, there has been a significant push by Alkermes and their lobbyists to really squelch other treatment, so that they can get access to bigger markets for their drug,\" says Dr. Corey Waller, an addiction specialist who heads legislative advocacy for the American Society of Addiction Medicine.\nWaller says people should be wary of the notion that Vivitrol is better than other drugs to treat opioid addiction. No studies comparing Vivitrol with buprenorphine or methadone have been published.\nChambers expressed similar concerns. He says Alkermes operates as though methadone and buprenorphine are competitors, when the drugs are actually meant for different types of patients. \"That's really an unfortunate dynamic,\" he says. \"They're not designed to do the same thing. It's like comparing apples and oranges.\"\nLegislating brand awareness\nIn a cramped hearing room at the Indiana statehouse in 2015, a week after McCaffrey's testimony in the health committee, the House Committee on Courts and Criminal Code convened to discuss another bill related to addiction — members were preparing to vote on an amendment that would write Vivitrol into state law.\n\"Vivitrol or a similar substance may be required to treat opioid or alcohol addiction as a condition of parole, probation, community corrections, pretrial diversion, or participation in a problem solving court,\" the bill digest read.\nMcCaffrey didn't testify that day, but he was there, although it wasn't clear whether he was representing Alkermes or his nonprofit, MHAI. When the meeting adjourned after a 12-0 vote in favor of the amendment, the camera and microphones were left on. In the video, McCaffrey pops into view to huddle with lawmakers, including Rep. Ryan Dvorak.\nDvorak had raised concerns earlier about the drug's cost and about identifying a brand-name medication in state law. In an interview, Dvorak said that after the vote that day, McCaffrey \"was trying to explain why it wouldn't really be that expensive.\"\nWhen McCaffrey testified later in front of a Senate committee, he characterized Vivitrol as the \"non-opioid opportunity.\"\nThe final version of the bill, which passed in April 2015, heeded concerns about using a brand name. The word \"Vivitrol\" was replaced with a distinctive phrase: \"a federal Food and Drug Administration-approved long acting, nonaddictive medication for the treatment of opioid or alcohol dependence.\"\nThe effect was the same. The only FDA-approved drug that currently fits that description is Vivitrol. In fact, it echoes language from Vivitrol marketing materials, and the phrase appeared in the bill a dozen times.\nThat language showed up in other bills in 2015 and 2016, essentially writing Vivitrol into sections of state code that deal with criminal justice and the regulation of methadone and buprenorphine treatment. As of 2016, the phrase \"nonaddictive medication\" appeared in Indiana state code 11 times.\nAnd it's not just in Indiana. The word \"Vivitrol\" or variations of the phrase that refers to Vivitrol appear in more than 70 bills and laws in 15 states, according to a 50-state search of legislation using Bloomberg Government.\nAddiction treatment experts say the intent is obvious: to encourage the use of Vivitrol over other options. \"I think anyone who's willing to put somebody's advertisement in legislation should be ashamed of themselves,\" says Waller. He worries the phrase could influence decisions made by lawmakers, judges and anyone else who reads or interprets the law.\nUsing \"nonaddictive\" to describe Vivitrol raises another issue for treatment experts, because it contributes to the widespread confusion between the meanings of addiction and dependence.\nAddiction, also known as substance use disorder, is \"characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences,\" according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. But in a treatment setting, buprenorphine and methadone help people avoid those risky behaviors. Patients are dependent on the medications — they would go into withdrawal without them — but that's not the same thing as being addicted to them.\nSome doctors compare being dependent on buprenorphine to the dependency someone with diabetes has on insulin: It's simply a medication needed to help manage a chronic condition.\nThe use of the term \"nonaddictive,\" both in Alkermes marketing materials and in its lobbying efforts, indirectly disparages other treatments, says Basia Andraka-Christou, a researcher at the Fairbanks School of Public Health in Indianapolis, who studies medication-assisted treatment. \"Even using 'nonaddictive' suggests that the other ones are super addictive, even though for most people, they're helpful and not abused,\" she says.\nBarriers to treatment\nSome of the policies that Alkermes and its lobbyists have supported can have real-world implications for people struggling with addiction.\nAbout a year ago, Angela and Nate Turner of Greenwood, Ind., were trying to quit heroin. They each had been injured years before, and doctors prescribed them opioid painkillers. Soon they were making regular trips to various doctors to feed their habit. Later, when doctors stopped filling their prescriptions, the Turners switched to heroin.\nThe overuse of painkillers like OxyContin is often blamed for the scale of the opioid epidemic. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control issued voluntary guidelines for prescribing opioids in response to the crisis, and some states have placed their own limitations on how the drugs are used.\nThe opioids used to treat addiction, however, have always been heavily regulated, and as a result can be hard to come by. Methadone, when prescribed to treat opioid addiction, can be delivered only at specialized clinics. Doctors need a special waiver to prescribe buprenorphine and are limited to treating 100 patients at a time (or 275 for select prescribers who meet special requirements). It's the only prescription opioid with such limitations.\nAnd patients who need buprenorphine can face further hurdles.\nWhen the Turners decided to stop using heroin, it took them a while to find a doctor. Eventually, they found one who prescribed Suboxone, a brand-name formulation of buprenorphine. But their insurance company made Angela wait three days to get her prescription filled. She spent that time in withdrawal: cold sweats, hot sweats, diarrhea, nausea and body aches. When interviewed by NPR and Side Effects Public Media in 2016, Angela said she was tempted to go back and use, just so she could take care of her daughter.\n\"That sounds bad, [that] you have to use to be a parent,\" she says. \"But it's either that or lay there and not being able to get up and feed your kid and do what you're supposed to be doing, you know?\"\nFor Nate, the wait was five days. He relapsed and used heroin. \"I couldn't do it no more,\" he said. \"I had to get something.\" He nearly lost his resolve to quit.\nThe delays the Turners faced were caused by their insurance company, which operates under Indiana's Medicaid program. Before paying for a given drug, insurers can force doctors and nurses to deal with back-and-forth paperwork, phone calls and even faxes. The process is known as prior authorization, and it's the single most significant barrier to prescribing buprenorphine, according to a peer-reviewed study. It can mean a dangerous wait for patients who need the medication.\nSome insurers and state Medicaid programs have started to eliminate the practice for buprenorphine, to make it easier for patients to get the medication.\nBut following McCaffrey's endorsement two years ago, Indiana lawmakers voted to explicitly allow Medicaid insurers to use prior authorizations for buprenorphine, and specifically exempted Vivitrol from those rules. (The final version of the bill removed the Vivitrol exemption, but most insurers under Indiana Medicaid will pay for Vivitrol without a prior authorization.)\n\"That really upset me,\" said Andraka-Christou when we showed her the bill. \"That is pretty explicitly saying that we're going to hamper one medication moreso than the other.\"\nDeterring would-be providers\nBuprenorphine treatment providers can already be hard to find, especially for patients in rural areas. Many doctors with the waiver to prescribe buprenorphine don't make use of it, and those who do often prescribe far below the 100-patient cap. Even if every doctor with a waiver reached the limit of 100 patients, they would treat fewer than half of all Americans suffering from addiction.\nDespite these circumstances, Alkermes has pushed for increased regulations on buprenorphine. For example, under a law recently passed in Ohio, doctors treating more than 30 patients with buprenorphine must now apply for a special license from the pharmacy board which adds new rules and a significant administrative burden to how they run their practice.\nLobbyists for Alkermes \"applauded the bill,\" says the bill's author, state. Sen. John Eklund. \"Their interest was in, is there anything they can do because Suboxone had such a toehold here in the state of Ohio, and they're looking to expand their business.\"\nDoctors are worried that these regulations could cause some smaller medical practices to simply give up on prescribing buprenorphine, or to never start — they might instead turn to Vivitrol as the option instead of dealing with these regulations. \"It might increase that pressure,\" says Dr. Shawn Ryan, an addiction specialist and president of the Ohio Society of Addiction Medicine.\nAlkermes tried a similar approach at the federal level, too. Leading up to the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in 2016, the company sought increased federal regulation of buprenorphine. \"This is one of the most intense behind-the-scenes lobbying efforts,\" said a Democratic congressional staffer, who was not authorized to speak on the record. \"It frustrated me to no end for 2 1/2, three years.\"\nThe company circulated a document, obtained by NPR and Side Effects, that presented slanted material about buprenorphine, focused on the drug's potential for diversion and abuse while largely ignoring its benefits for individuals and for public health. \"This is basically a very long attempt to bash buprenorphine,\" said Andraka-Christou when we showed her the documents.\nA spokesperson for Alkermes, Matthew Henson, acknowledged in a phone interview that the company circulated the white paper, which he described as a \"working document\" meant to educate federal lawmakers about medication-assisted treatment options. The document doesn't mention Vivitrol. Asked why Alkermes was circulating a document focused on a medication it doesn't manufacture, Henson said he would get back to us. He never did.\nAs lawmakers sought to expand access to treatment, the white paper called for stricter regulation of buprenorphine through a bill dubbed the Opioid Addiction Treatment Modernization Act, introduced in the House in June 2015. \"The legislation they wanted introduced was actually going the other direction, in terms of making it more onerous to be a doctor wanting to prescribe these medications, and would have hurt treatment capacity in this country,\" says the staffer.\nThat bill died, but the staffer says the company still influenced the way some federal lawmakers speak about opioid maintenance.\n\"This is government-supported addiction. It is not moving people to sobriety,\" said Republican Rep. Tim Murphy, in a subcommittee meeting in March 2015, referring to buprenorphine and methadone. The staffer says they often heard Alkermes lobbyists disparage opioid maintenance therapy using the same language. Murphy has received campaign donations from Alkermes, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nRecently, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said methadone and buprenorphine treatment was simply \"substituting one opioid for another,\" a comment that angered treatment professionals and contradicts information provided by his own department's website:\n\"A common misconception associated with [medication-assisted treatment] is that it substitutes one drug for another. Instead, these medications relieve the withdrawal symptoms and psychological cravings that cause chemical imbalances in the body.\"\nHe made the remarks not long after touring an Alkermes plant with CEO Pops.\nAdvocating abstinence\nIn its quest to increase market share for Vivitrol, our investigation found, Alkermes leverages another common misconception about addiction and recovery to influence policy in its favor: the idea that medication-assisted therapy should be used on a short-term basis.\nAt the end of 2016, Indiana released new guidelines for addiction treatment providers in the state. The guidelines were created as a result of two bills, and according to testimony, lobbyist Steve McCaffrey was instrumental in drafting both.\nIf a patient tests positive for a controlled substance, the new guidelines say that the doctor needs to consider adjusting the treatment plan with the \"goal of opioid abstinence.\"\nBut pushing for opioid abstinence can be dangerous, according to federal health agencies and the American Society of Addiction Medicine. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services puts it this way: \"[A]ll forms of withdrawal are less effective compared with ongoing opioid maintenance.\"\nThe Indiana guidelines even contradict themselves. The document borrows verbatim from ASAM's treatment guidelines, saying that if a patient is using another opioid, the doctor should consider increasing — not decreasing — the buprenorphine dose, so the patient feels less desire to use additional opioids.\n\"If you prematurely stop the medication-assisted treatment, then you have a super high risk of relapse and death,\" says Waller. He says addiction is a chronic disease, needing ongoing treatment, and the medications help regulate it. \"I don't know why we seem to have such a fascination with a need for [patients] to be fully off of treatment,\" he says.\nPushing for opioid abstinence, however, could help Alkermes sell more Vivitrol, since the drug is the only non-opioid treatment for opioid addiction.\nThe language used in Indiana recommending treatment with a \"goal of opioid abstinence\" is mirrored in a new Pennsylvania bill. The bill would require office-based treatment providers (which means doctors who prescribe buprenorphine) and methadone clinics to conduct a \"periodic review\" of their patients' treatment plans and to consider \"the possibility of opioid abstinence.\"\nThe measure's author, state Sen. Camera Bartolotta, acknowledges she spoke to Alkermes. \"I've talked to them,\" she says. However, she denied that it would benefit a specific medication. \"This is not a pharmaceutical bill. This is a treatment bill.\"\nAnother bill introduced in Pennsylvania would require buprenorphine prescribers to pay $10,000 for a license to operate.\nSales goals vs. the common good\nWaller says it is troubling to see Alkermes promote legislation that makes it harder for patients to get access to other FDA-approved treatments. \"It's just unethical,\" he said.\nBut the company's tactics don't exist in a vacuum. Pharmaceutical companies routinely try to undercut their competitors and promote their own products, says Adriane Fugh-Berman, who studies pharmaceutical marketing at Georgetown University. She added that some drug makers have also used legislation to gain an edge over competitors. What Alkermes appears to have done, Fugh-Berman says, is combine those strategies. \"That is not pro-public health. That is anti-public health,\" she said.\nDespite repeated requests, Alkermes did not make any of its leadership available for an interview for this story. In an email to NPR and Side Effects, company spokesman Henson wrote: \"To suggest that we have any more authority or influence than any other company, advocacy group or treatment provider that cares about this disease just isn't fair.\"\nAlkermes' success in influencing state policy comes from the way it plays into people's pre-existing beliefs about addiction. \"When you talk about Vivitrol or naltrexone, you're talking about working more towards abstinence,\" said Davisson, the author of one of the pro-Vivitrol bills in Indiana. \"A lot of people are more comfortable with that type of language.\"\nWhen told about Steve McCaffrey's lobbying for Alkermes, Davisson said the arrangement didn't bother him, even though he was unaware of it when he worked with McCaffrey on the bill. Other lawmakers who worked closely with McCaffrey were also unconcerned about his ties to the company.\nIn its emailed statement, Alkermes says it favors access to all treatment options, a sentiment McCaffrey echoed: \"I would always agree that we want open access to whatever treatment is available according to the physician.\"\nMcCaffrey argued that as policymakers become more accustomed to using Vivitrol to treat addiction, they will eventually become more open to supporting treatment with buprenorphine and methadone as well.\nAfter an initial interview, McCaffrey did not agree to talk further. Earlier this year, McCaffrey released a list of addiction-related bills that Mental Health America of Indiana worked on in 2017. The bills insert \"nonaddictive medication\" into state law seven times. All of them were signed by the governor.\nBut policies favoring Vivitrol can have drastic consequences for people like Nate and Angela Turner, who want to overcome their opioid addiction but struggle with long wait times for access to medication-assisted treatment. \"Doctors got us on the the pain medication,\" said Angela, \"and got us on the drugs. A doctor should be able to help us.\"\n\"We actually need these things to help us back into society and to be productive,\" said Nate.\nWith millions of people addicted to opioids, the people treating addiction want to reduce the pain, suffering and death associated with the disease. To do that, they need whatever medications are available, not just one.\nThis story is part of a reporting collaboration with NPR, Side Effects Public Media and WFYI.

The accused or their family can be required to put down money in order to return home as they await a trial (which can take months, years, or never even happen)—which in practice has disproportionately hurt communities that are low-income (because they struggle to come up with the necessary funds) and black (who see higher rates of jail time, like other communities of color). The deaths of Sandra Bland, Jeffrey Pendleton, and Kalief Browder—all of whom were black and remained unable to post bail after being arrested—have publicized how so many Americans are unable to get out of jail because of bail requirements. And yet, despite the well-documented inequalities and flaws in the system, and the increasing pressure to change it, “money bail,” as the practice is called, remains the norm in the American legal system, propping up a thriving for-profit bail-bonds industry.\nIt’s no wonder that so many low-income people awaiting trial have to turn to a bail-bonds operation. According to the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit, black men and women ages 23 to 39 who were being held in local jails had median earnings of between $568 and $900 the month prior to their arrest. The median bail for a felony arrest, meanwhile, is $10,000, a sum most arrested individuals and their families would simply be unable to pay. On top of that, black defendants between the ages of 18 and 29 years old were asked to pay, on average, higher sums for bail and were less likely to be released on their own recognizance, meaning no bail payment was required.\nA new report from the nonprofit Color of Change and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sheds further light on the country’s bail system. The report finds that around 70 percent of those currently in jail have yet to be convicted of a crime. Not unrelated: Between 1990 and 2009, the share of people arrested who were required to post money bail grew from 37 percent to 61 percent, according to the report.\nThis means that families who can’t afford bail face a difficult choice: either leave a loved one behind bars—something that’s been shown to threaten their physical and mental health, and increase the likelihood of conviction—or enter into financial agreements with bail-bonds corporations. Given that these are the usual choices, it’s no surprise that the share of releases that depended on for-profit bail bonds outfits has climbed along with the share of arrests requiring money bail for release, growing to 49 percent in 2009 from only 24 percent in 1990.\nIn a fairer world, people wouldn’t be penalized by the legal system for not having, say, $10,000 in liquid cash\nIn a standard bail agreement, families that have enough money to post bail give it directly to the court and get their money returned once a case is over. But it’s different for families that rely on private bail bonds: Instead of paying a refundable amount to the court, they pay a non-refundable portion of the total bail (usually 10 percent) to a bail-bonds company, which then writes a bond for the full bail amount promising that it will be paid if the person doesn’t appear for court. That 10-percent payment is money that customers will never get back, even if there’s no conviction. In addition to losing the money they’ve put down, bail bonds also often leave families paying loan installments and fees even after a case is resolved, the study finds. And bail-bond agreements often include additional terms, which can bring on additional fees, surveillance, and/or property loss, if a house or other asset was put up as collateral.\nThe sums that families lose in the for-profit bail system is striking. Over a five year period just in the state of Maryland, families of people who were accused of crimes and went on to be cleared of any wrongdoing parted with around $75 million in non-refundable bail-bond payments, according to the report. Looking at discrepancies by race makes the findings even bleaker. In 2015, fewer than 5,000 families in New Orleans together paid $4.7 million in non-refundable premiums, and black families paid 84 percent of bail premiums and fees city-wide that year.\nThe study also illuminates the structure of the bail-bond industry, and where it gets its capital. For-profit bail businesses are, it should be noted, not part of the country’s legal apparatus. (In fact, the only two countries that allow companies to operate for-profit bail operations are the United States and the Philippines.) And it’s not just bondsmen who are making money off of bail bonds. While bail-bond services are often associated with the myriad small storefronts that can be found in poor communities across the country, many of them, the report finds, are actually run by large global insurance companies.\nThe bail system, in theory, is supposed to minimize the risk that an arrested party will inhibit the legal process, usually by failing to show up for court or fleeing the area. The threat of losing the money posted for bail is supposed to deter such evasive tactics.\nWhen people rely on bail bonds, they become involved in a complex transfer of money and risk, such that families generally wind up on the hook, the study finds. That’s because bail involves what are known as “surety” bonds, which are increasingly backed by large global insurers. When a family pays a bail-bonds agent, the bail-bonds company then pays an insurance company a portion of that money to back the bond they’ve issued. The company also pays into what is called a “build-up fund,” which ensures that money is available if needed. But unlike insurance one might take out on a car or home, surety bonds place the risk and requirement for full payment on the person who takes out the bond. If the bonded individual doesn’t show up for their court appearance, which would trigger a need for the full bail amount to be paid, the insurer only has to pay up as a last resort.\nAccording to Color of Change and the ACLU, it rarely comes to that. In essence, families wind up taking on debt and risk while bond companies and insurers mostly just get the profit of the bail premiums, fees, and fines that families pay. In a fairer world, people wouldn’t be penalized by the legal system for not having, say, $10,000 in liquid cash: Either there wouldn’t be money bail, or money bail would at least be more affordable, or the bond companies and insurers would actually shoulder significant risk after taking a non-refundable payment of $1,000, which is a fee that people with enough funds ultimately don’t have to pay.\nOverall, the industry is a profitable and fairly concentrated one. Though there are more than 25,000 bail-bonds companies across the U.S., only about 10 insurers are responsible for underwriting the bulk of the $14 billion in bonds that are issued each year. The industry as a whole brings in around $2 billion in profit a year. Surprisingly, it’s not even clear which companies are actually involved. The report finds that private-equity firms play a role, but their holdings are often murky because global insurers build in several layers of opaque corporate structures between their corporate brand, bond-insurance operations, and bail-bonds storefronts.\nBecause insurance is largely regulated on a state-by-state basis, oversight of insurers participating in for-profit bail operations can vary widely and get lost in the scope of an insurer’s larger business operations. And these insurers make serious lobbying efforts to keep things this way, making reform even harder. The result is a system in which the poor often wind up even further in debt after getting arrested, whether they’re guilty or not."},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-05-15/trumps-immigration-rhetoric-causing-drop-international-student-admissions","title":"Is Trump's immigration rhetoric causing a drop in international student applications?","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Public Radio International","description":"One survey suggests that some foreign-born applicants may soon be saying \"no thanks\" to studying in the US.","date":"","full_text":"RTSOH0Z.jpg\nStudents from the Middle East, Asia and Latin America are growing more fearful of attending college in the US.\nThat’s according to a recent survey by the American Association of College Registrar and Admissions Officers. Higher education institutions have reported a decline in international student applications and, experts say, the current political climate is a factor.\n“There was a larger trend of students and their families reacting to the political rhetoric that was occurring around the election and post election and what is being shown in the media,” says Melanie Gottlieb, deputy director of the association and the survey’s lead researcher. “Those were manifesting as concerns about whether pursuing academic study in the US should still be an option.”\nThe survey, polled more than 250 colleges and universities nationwide on their current application numbers, indicates that 38 percent of the undergraduate institutions surveyed saw a drop in their number of international applications (PDF). Thirty-one percent of graduate schools reported a decrease in applications from abroad.\nAt the same time, 35 percent of the schools surveyed reported an increase in applications and 27 percent reported no change at all.\nGottlieb says the survey was in direct response to “increasing concern from international educators that the political climate could be damaging to international student recruitment efforts” and is meant to be “snapshot of student and family perceptions” in the year leading up to the presidential election through February.\nPrior studies have shown that international students have been coming to the US in steadily increasing numbers for 10 years.\nGottlieb says that part of the change in the number of international applications this year is related to the 2016 presidential election cycle, President Donald Trump’s campaign rhetoric and the administration’s immigration initiatives in its early months. His executive order that restricts travel from certain countries has been halted by court injunctions, as a case about its legality proceeds. The Trump presented its arguments on the policy to an appeals court on Monday.\nAlso: Historians annotate and analyze immigration ban's place in history\nStill, universities have seen the effect of these kinds of policies on potential students abroad. “Institutions have had to adjust to the perception of negative attitudes toward the political rhetoric,” Gottlieb says. “The areas of concern aligned pretty clearly with current political issues like travel bans, immigration and work visas.”\nSchools surveyed reported that students often cited safety, feeling welcome and post-graduation job prospects as influencing their application and enrollment decisions. Anxieties varied by region, with the most concern reported by students in the Middle East, India and Latin America.\nAccording to the survey, applicants from India and China, who account for nearly half of all international students, say the “perception of a rise in student visa denials at US embassies and consulates” is source of worry among applicants and their families.\nStudents from the Middle East reported the highest increase in anxiety about enrolling in US universities. Surveyors attribute this to both political changes and an increase in threats against Muslims.\nAccording to the Institute of International Education, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that focuses on international exchange, the nearly 1 million international students attending US colleges and universities contribute $36 billion annually to the US economy. They also provide an important source of tuition revenue for many universities.\nGottlieb adds that, often, universities rely on international student enrollment for cultural exchange initiatives.\nAmerican University in Washington, DC, is one school that saw no measurable change in applications from abroad. Evelyn Levinson, the university's international admissions director, credits adjustments to the university’s recruitment tactics such as more trips, listening sessions and webinars addressing student concerns.\nBut she also cautions that this year’s numbers may not reflect the true impact on international student population trends. The survey measures international student applications, not how many of those students actually enrolled.\nData on the number of international students who eventually enrolled won’t be available until next year.\n“By the time of presidential elections in November, most students have already applied for colleges, or made up their minds about whether to apply,” she says. “The true impact will likely be in what we see for applications for fall 2018 and beyond.”\nInternational student enrollment numbers tend to shift based on foreign policy and current events, such as the terror attacks of September 2001 and the Iranian hostage crisis of 1981. “The climate can definitely be a deterrent,” Levinson says.\nThe survey is not quite a wakeup call, but she says it should push institutions to think differently about how to recruit foreign students.\n“We just have to be ready. Know who you are and make sure the message sent is one of welcome and inclusion at all times.”\nShe adds that more foreign-born students may look to Canada and England as alternatives. Canada has already seen a surge in admitted international students.\nAn earlier version of this story misstated the results of the survey. The survey reported that 40 percent of undergraduate schools reported a drop, rather than 40 percent fewer applicants."},{"url":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teacher-expectations-black-students_us_591b4e13e4b05dd15f0c082a?section=us_education","title":"However Well Black Students Perform, Teachers Still Think They're Struggling","author_text":null,"keywords":["U.S. News","Racism","Asian Voices","7 12 Education","K 6 Education","Educational Testing","Languages","English As A Foreign Or Second Language"],"publication_text":"HuffPost","description":"Teachers are twice as likely to say their classes are \"too difficult\" for black students as they are for whites.","date":"2017-05-17","full_text":"Hua-Yu Sebastian Cherng, assistant professor of international education at New York University, has written thousands of pages’ worth of research and commentary over the course of his career. But growing up, his teachers gave him no reason to believe he would end up in this position. As an Asian-American student living in Maryland, he consistently ran up against stereotypes suggesting that he should be uninterested or incompetent in English language arts.\nIn elementary school, Cherng was placed in remedial English, even though there was no evidence he needed it. When he won a high school poetry contest, he said, an English teacher reacted with indifference.\nHe attributes the behavior to stereotypes that Asian students are foreign-born, and thus at a disadvantage in English language arts. Instead, teachers expected Cherng to excel in math, even though that’s a subject in which he would have appreciated extra help.\n“I was born in the U.S. and having many English teachers assume I wasn’t interested in the topic or that I wasn’t good at English, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Cherng said. “At the end of high school, I thought I wasn’t good at writing.”\nBecause of Cherng’s experiences, he was less than surprised at the outcome of his latest research looking at the relationship between teacher expectations and student achievement. Stereotypes about students’ race and class affect how math and English teachers expect students to perform, even after taking students’ test scores and rates of homework completion into account, according to the research.\nMath and English teachers are significantly more likely to think their classes are too difficult for black and Latino students. English teachers also have lower expectations for Asian students. This, in turn, negatively affects these students’ expectations of themselves.\nBlack students, in particular, bear the brunt of low expectations. Compared to white students, math and English teachers are more than twice as likely to say that black students cannot handle the difficulty of their classes.\nThe Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.\nHowever, black students do not shirk these academic challenges, even in the face of bias. Overall, students’ grades are negatively impacted by teachers’ underestimations, per Cherng’s research. However, black students’ grades do not suffer as much as those of other groups, even though they face heightened prejudices. These results suggest a “narrative of resistance,” in which black students work extra hard to prove their teachers wrong, according to Cherng.\nIn an optimistic way, it’s a problem we can solve. If we change things like how we train teachers... I think [it] could make a world of difference.\n“If a student is in a classroom and can sense a teacher thinks poorly of them, black students in particular may resist that narrative, resist fulfilling that narrative, and within the classroom may be able to fight it,” Cherng said. “This could translate as not being as harmed as other students in the short term or medium term.”\nIn the long run, though, these biases can be devastating. Black students hold harsh views about whether or not they can succeed in higher education.\n“The longer-term consequences on things, like whether or not they think they can go to college, it takes years to form these ideas,” Cherng said. “In that sense, it’s a more subtle influence that can actually hurt black students more than other students.”\nTo glean his results, Cherng used data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, which surveyed 10,000 high school students and their teachers. This survey asked teachers about their expectations of students, which Cherng then compared to students’ expectations of themselves and their GPAs.\nWhile the results are depressing, Cherng says they also give him reason to hope.\n“In an optimistic way, it’s a problem we can solve,” he said. “If we change things like how we train teachers, if we change things like making teachers able to acknowledge that they have biases, I think [it] could make a world of difference.”"},{"url":"http://www.startribune.com/at-bethel-university-eight-special-students-celebrate-a-milestone/424701763","title":"At Bethel University, eight special students celebrate a milestone","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Star Tribune","description":"First graduating class of Bethel University Inclusive Learning and Development program is filled with pride and excitement.","date":"","full_text":"Two years ago, Lauren Thysell had no interest in going to college. She was content to live at home in Wayzata and hang out with her mom, her constant companion.\nBut on Saturday, Thysell, who has Down syndrome, will graduate from a special program at Bethel University in Arden Hills with two jobs, scads of friends and an apartment of her own.\nThysell, 26, is one of eight students in the first graduating class of the Bethel University Inclusive Learning and Development (BUILD) program.\nIt’s one of only a few such programs in Minnesota (and hundreds nationwide) to give students with intellectual disabilities a chance at college life.\nUntil recently, says Cathy Sallas, Thysell’s mother, “no one ever thought quite about college as a possibility” for such students. But when she learned that Bethel was launching its program in 2015, Sallas jumped at the chance to enroll her daughter.\n“I just said, ‘This is fantastic,’ ” she recalled.\nThe two-year program at Bethel is based on what Sallas calls “a really wonderful concept” — the students live in dorms, and attend classes, with the help of other Bethel student “mentors” and professionals to provide them with extra support.\nNationally, the number of college programs for students with intellectual disabilities has soared over the past decade, from 25 in 2004 to 248 last year, according to a study by Think College, a national advocacy center.\nAt Bethel, most of the classes are tailored to their special needs, including lessons on cooking, cleaning and social skills, as well writing résumés and interviewing for jobs.\nAlong the way, the students get a taste of independence and a chance to blend into the lakeside campus with hundreds of other college kids — playing sports, singing in the choir, working in the dining hall and learning to navigate the world on their own.\n“She basically fell in love with it from day one,” Sallas says of her daughter.\nOn Thursday, as Thysell and her classmates gathered for their final presentations in the “social skills and self-determination” class, their emotions seemed raw as they sensed their shared experience drawing to a close.\n“I just loved being here at Bethel,” Thysell said, before breaking down in tears.\nDawn Allen, the program director, leaned in to comfort her. “So, Lauren, what are you going to celebrate?” she asked gently.\n“Everybody,” the young woman said between sobs. “You.”\nSam Kohs, a 24-year-old classmate from Forest Lake, was asked if he was excited about graduation. “Yes and no,” he admitted. “I am happy and then not happy, because I don’t want to leave the dorm and all the friends. But also, I want to move on and get, like, a job.”\nDiane Iverson, a special education teacher who led their social skills class, said the transformation in the students has been dramatic. “They’ve just become so independent,” she said. When they first started, “some students would sit and cry rather than ask me questions,” she recalled. But they’ve learned to speak up for themselves. “They’ve just grown so much emotionally,” she said.\nThey’ve also gained a new level of confidence, says Allen, the program director. As part of the program, all the students are placed in internships, to give them practical experience working on and off campus. She believes that will serve them well as they enter the working world.\n“I think that will mean a lot to future employers, to be able to see that they completed a college program,” she said. “It helps to take the guesswork out of ‘can they handle this job,’ because they’ve already done it.”\nThis fall, school officials hope to enroll 16 more students in the program.\nThe price tag is the same as Bethel’s traditional academic program — $45,000 for tuition, room, and board. But this year, for the first time, students in the BUILD program were eligible for federal and state student aid to help cover the costs, according to Allen.\nSallas, who will watch her daughter graduate with a special certificate Saturday, has no doubt that it’s worth it. “Society has finally acknowledged that we can’t put these people on the sidelines,” she said. And she believes a college experience can be just as valuable for people with intellectual disabilities as for any other young adult.\nJust look at her own daughter, she says. “She realizes she has a life bigger than her own family and her own immediate community, and that is huge,” she said.\n“She has this confidence about herself now that will really take her to the next step of living and being part of society.”"},{"url":"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2017/0317/Campuses-take-a-stand-when-protests-go-too-far","title":"Campuses take a stand when protests go too far","author_text":"The Christian Science Monitor","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Christian Science Monitor","description":"In a move to expose students to more diverse viewpoints, colleges and universities have invited controversial figures to speak, resulting in disruptive protests. Here's a look at how three schools are drawing the line between the free exchange of ideas and the right to protest those ideas.","date":"2017-03-17","full_text":"The March 2 confrontation at Middlebury College got worse. As Mr. Murray was leaving the building, a small group of demonstrators confronted him. According to accounts (here and here), campus guards shoved aside a protester blocking the way and violence ensued. Protesters rocked his car. The Middlebury professor who was the evening’s moderator suffered a concussion. (Reports vary as to whether it was intentional or an accident.)\nThe incident – and violent protests a month earlier that prompted University of California, Berkeley, officials to cancel a speech by now former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos – are causing some liberal arts schools to take a long look in the mirror: Are they really places where controversial views can be aired and debated civilly? Or, as protesters assert, are they giving a platform to speakers who espouse hate?\nAlthough violence is rare, campus activism aimed at discouraging or disrupting controversial speakers has become increasingly common – and the pushback to it is growing. For example:\nFour days after the fracas at Middlebury, faculty posted a statement of principles around “free inquiry.” And Middlebury President Laurie Patton penned several open letters, highlighting among other things a much less publicized meeting after the protest where students, faculty, and staff from a range of political perspectives talked about building bridges. “We are also committed to upholding the right to speech, even unpopular speech, especially in times of division or uncertainty,” she wrote in a March 6 letter. “If colleges and universities cannot serve this role, who can?”\nAfter several speeches were disrupted at the University of Chicago, a specially convened committee issued a report March 7, noting: “Disruptive conduct may itself be a form of speech, but that does not mean that it is a protected form of speech. Like other forms of civil disobedience, disruptive conduct may lead to disciplinary consequences for those engaged in such conduct.”\nAlthough Northwestern University hasn’t experienced such headline-grabbing events, its undergraduate student government passed a resolution March 1 urging the university to enforce policies related to academic freedom, the right to protest peacefully, the need to protect against censorship, and the right of invited guests to speak “without the threat of disruption.” Sponsors ranged from libertarian to Republican to left-leaning independent, says senior Lauren Thomas, who crafted the resolution.\nNorthwestern’s resolution was hailed as a first by Heterodox Academy, a network of professors who say declines in political diversity and willingness to debate difficult subjects are undermining the quality of higher education on many campuses.\n“When students get out of college and have to interact with clients, bosses, colleagues … you can’t pick and choose in the real world what people get to say,” says Jeremy Willinger, communications director of Heterodox Academy. When conservative speakers come to campus, he says, “that’s an opportunity for both students on the left and students on the right to have their ideas challenged, … to ask questions, to engage.”\nThose who say free speech is being stifled on campuses say that's particularly egregious at public universities, such as Berkeley, which receive government funding.\nAn event or an endorsement?\nBut it’s not that simple, protesters argue. By giving a speaker a platform, a school at some level is endorsing the speaker’s ideas as worthy of attention. The more controversial those ideas, the worse that proposition looks to protesters.\n“When people talk about free speech as just a matter of not disrupting people who already have a platform, it bypasses the question of who’s able to get a platform in the first place,” says Ben Powell, a Northwestern student who serves on the executive board of the student government and opposed Ms. Thomas’s resolution.\nIn the run-up to Murray’s speech at Middlebury, students and professors asked the administration to rescind his invitation by a conservative student group. An open letter signed by 58 faculty and post-doctoral students asked President Patton not to introduce Murray. “His work has employed a combination of eugenics and other pseudo-science that has time and time again shown to be based on false premises, inadequate research and erroneous conclusions,” the letter read “He is not an academic nor a ‘critically acclaimed’ public scholar, but a well-funded phony.”\nMurray, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), is the latest in a long line of authors who have generated controversy by writing that intelligence is at least partly inherited; that some groups are therefore inherently smarter than others; and that IQ, more than any other indicator, determines success in life. Often, these writers have compared races (usually black vs. white) and generated a backlash when they speak on college campuses. The Southern Poverty Law Center has branded him a “white nationalist.”\nBut supporters on the right argue that the left unfairly caricatures Murray as a genetic racist when, in fact, his focus has been on class. The father of two biracial children (his first wife was Thai), he wrote in his most famous book, “The Bell Curve,” that environment as well as genetics are likely to have an impact on intelligence. He focused his 2012 book, “Coming Apart,” on upper- and lower-class whites to show that class divisions are more important than racial ones.\nStill, his ideas that certain groups don’t have the intelligence to rise naturally beyond a certain station challenge liberal ideas about the power of education, desegregation, and affirmative action to transform an individual’s environment and establish a more equal society. Murray’s thesis also provide fodder for racists and neo-Nazis.\nA new normal?\nSuch ideas have sparked protests at colleges before. But the violence is new, Murray writes on AEI’s website: “I have had considerable experience with campus protests. Until last Thursday, all of the ones involving me have been as carefully scripted as kabuki: The college administration meets with the organizers of the protest and ground rules are agreed upon. The protesters have so many minutes to do such and such. It is agreed that after the allotted time, they will leave or desist…. At least a couple of dozen times, I have been able to give my lecture to an attentive (or at least quiet) audience despite an organized protest.”\nAt Middlebury, the protesters did not agree to ground rules, he writes. “If this becomes the new normal, the number of colleges willing to let themselves in for an experience like Middlebury’s will plunge to near zero.”\nAt Northwestern, the debate over tactics is ongoing. Mr. Powell argues there is a moral argument to be made for disruptive protest that targets views and policies that “cause real harm to people.”\nBut for Thomas, disruption has a chilling effect on free expression, and it affects all types of students and faculty, not just conservatives. Among the examples she cited in her resolution:\nNorthwestern’s administration censored an academic medical journal because of public relations’ concerns over the impact it would have on the medical school’s brand;\nPalestinian activist Bassem Eid canceled a scheduled speech at Northwestern’s Hillel last year after trouble on another campus and information that hecklers were intending to prevent him from speaking freely;\nAdministrations at other campuses have rejected certain student groups, such as Fordham University not allowing Students for Justice in Palestine.\n“I personally have learned from having views that do not agree with me around me, and I would like to see other students have the same opportunity,” says Thomas, a moderate conservative who is studying economics and political science. “You can’t learn if everyone around you is just agreeing with what you say.”"},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/may/17/looking-tired-can-harm-your-social-life-say-researchers","title":"Looking tired can harm your social life, say researchers","author_text":"Ian Sample","keywords":["Psychology","Science","Sleep","Health \u0026 Wellbeing","Life And Style"],"publication_text":"the Guardian","description":"People who have had too little sleep are considered less attractive, in poorer health and less appealing to socialise with, a psychology study has found","date":"2017-05-17","full_text":"Never mind the pallid face, wrinkles and bloodshot eyes. Missing out on sleep can harm your social life as well as your looks, researchers say.\nPsychologists found that people who had too little sleep were not only regarded as less attractive and in poorer health than when they had rested, they were also considered less appealing to socialise with.\nThe haggard, pasty looks of the sleep-deprived may encourage others to steer clear, just as humans learned over millennia to keep away from their sickly associates on the savannah to avoid picking up diseases.\nBut looking rough is not enough to put people off, the scientists found. “If someone looks less healthy, you are more likely to withdraw from them,” said Tina Sundelin at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. “However, that does not explain the entire effect of not wanting to socialise with them. It’s one of the factors, but it’s not the whole story.”\nMountains of research have thrown up a host of good reasons to avoid the sleep deprived. A serious lack of sleep can make people less optimistic and less sociable, and dent their empathy towards others. People become worse at understanding and expressing emotions and more prone to having accidents. Sleep loss has also been shown to make people more irritable. As Sundelin puts it: “If you can see someone hasn’t slept, you’ll have a good idea that they might not be the best person to be around.”\nAt first glance, keeping people at arm’s length when they’ve had too little sleep might seem like adding insult to injury. But as the researchers point out, being left alone might be precisely what the sleep-deprived person craves in order to recover.\nWriting in the Royal Society journal Open Science, Sundelin and her colleagues describe how they photographed 25 people after two nights of normal sleep and after two nights of only four hours sleep. They then asked 122 others to rate the photos for attractiveness, health, sleepiness and trustworthiness.\nA couple of nights of insufficient sleep had no effect on how trustworthy people looked, but raters said they were less inclined to socialise with the sleep deprived, and considered them to be less attractive, less healthy and, of course, more sleepy.\nThe effects of sleep loss on social appeal were minor though. Having four hours sleep for two nights on the trot led to a mere 4% drop in social appeal, according to the study. More important was how tired people looked, rather than the amount of sleep they actually got. The raters were 20-30% less keen on socialising with people who looked very tired compared with those who looked very alert. “If you want to go out and have a good time, it might not be much fun if the person looks really sleepy,” said John Axelsson, who led the research team.\nThe study builds on previous work from Axelsson and his colleagues at the Karolinska Institute. In one study, the team reported telltale signs of sleep loss in a group of people who stayed awake for 31 hours after only five hours of sleep the night before. They found a long list of facial clues, from hanging eyelids, redder eyes and dark rings under the eyes, to paler skin, more wrinkles and droopier corners of the mouth.\n“Sleep loss has an impact on how other people judge you, so prioritising sleep is not a bad idea,” said Axelsson. “But one shouldn’t be too concerned. The effects are not large. It’s not that no-one wants to be with you when you’ve had too little sleep.”"},{"url":"http://www.cleveland.com/akron/index.ssf/2017/05/salvation_army_of_summit_count_1.html","title":"Salvation Army of Summit County accepting applications for youth summer enrichment program","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"cleveland.com","description":"The Salvation Army, Summit County Area Services, is accepting applications for its new Billy Booth's Arts \u0026 Science Factory summer enrichment program.","date":"","full_text":"AKRON, Ohio - The Salvation Army, Summit County Area Services, is accepting applications for its new Billy Booth's Arts \u0026 Science Factory summer enrichment program.\nThe redesigned program, named after Salvation Army founder William Booth, offers STEM, music, art and agriculture programming for students who have completed kindergarten through age 12.

But right beside some of them, a “band of sisters” kept them safe. In her 2015 book “Ashley’s War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield,” journalist Gayle Tzemach Lemmon details a little-known Army program that assigned all-female units to support male soldiers. Known as Cultural Support Teams (CST), these women helped gather intelligence from mothers and daughters in Afghan households, while male counterparts conducted raids to find insurgents.\n“In a conservative and traditional society like Afghanistan, particularly places where the insurgency was strongest, male soldiers — no matter how good they were at fighting — could not speak to Afghan women,” Lemmon recounts at a Got Your 6 Storytellers event in Los Angeles. Lemmon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who spent an extensive amount of time in Afghanistan for her previous book “The Dressmaker of Khair Khana,” reported the story of Lt. Ashley White and her unit through hundreds of hours of interviews over the course of two years. In an interview with NationSwell, Lemmon discussed what she learned about women’s role in the military during her research.\nWhat inspired you to share the story of CST in Afghanistan?\nIt was the impossibility of the story on the surface — this group of teammates who became friends and then family at a time when women officially were banned from ground combat. Here was a group of Americans who answered their country’s call to serve, who went onto the battlefield alongside Rangers and SEALs, and who were forever changed by it. They broke ground in service to their country, and we didn’t know them. I wanted to share this slice of history we didn’t know.\nWhile embedded, what did you learn about what it means to serve as an American soldier?\nI saw young Americans going in and out of Afghanistan, risking their lives for their nation and for the friends they had come to love. I wanted to share that connection, that friendship, that desire to serve.\nWhat does camaraderie look like in an all-female unit?\nMuch the same as in an all-male unit. It was about friendship and sisterhood and caring for one another — only it was even more extreme because they were all they had out there, the only people who knew and understood all that they saw and did at the tip of the spear while women officially weren’t there.\nHow did meeting these female warriors change your idea of womanhood?\nThis story took me into a world I had never known of women who were funny and fierce, driven and kind, intense and warm. So many times the women we see on our pages or on our screens are one or the other. I wanted to show these women in all their dimensions and to tell a story that was true to who they are and were.\nWhat three words describe your experience abroad?\nAfghanistan is a generous, inspiring and heartbreaking place.\nWhat is the quality you most admired in the troops you met?\nTenacity and grit alongside great heart.\nHow can someone support veterans?\nGet involved. Listen to veterans’ stories. Help veterans with their transition into the next phase of life and be aware of the wars we have asked them to fight. Too many are too distant from the battle and don’t want to hear what it was like for the 1 percent of the country that has fought 100 percent of its 15 years of war. That must change.\nWhat unique challenges do female veterans face?\nWe must recognize that veterans are women and women are veterans. We must expand our version of the veteran to make sure it includes women and the valor they have shown these past decades of war. Otherwise, our antiquated views of what women have and are doing keeps us as a country from offering the respect and the support they deserve from us.\nMORE: This Resourceful Soldier Goes From Fighting on the Front Lines to Running a Fashion Line"},{"url":"http://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/30/npr-states-fear-price-of-new-zika-vaccine-will-be-more-than-they-can-pay","title":"States fear price of new Zika vaccine will be more than they can pay","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"The vaccine against Zika vaccine was developed by the Army, with the government paying for clinical trials, too. Health officials want to be sure drugmaker Sanofi Pasteur doesn't make it unaffordable.","date":"","full_text":"Editor's note: This story has been updated to include information on how Sanofi Pasteur was chosen as the company to license the Zika vaccine.\nThe U.S. Army is planning to grant an exclusive license to the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. to manufacture and sell a Zika vaccine the Army developed last year.\nAnd that has Rebekah Gee, Louisiana's secretary of health, worried about paying for it.\n\"God forbid we have a Zika outbreak. We're in the middle of a fiscal crisis, we're already cutting services to people and we're already potentially cutting our funding to fight the Zika virus,\" Gee says.\nIf the Army goes through with its plan, she says, Sanofi could set a price for the vaccine at a level that Louisianans just won't be able to afford.\nGee is among a growing number of public officials and activists who are demanding that Sanofi agree to show restraint when it sets the price for the vaccine, which was developed by the Army.\nShe wants the company to promise in writing that it won't charge U.S. buyers any more than it charges in other wealthy countries – like its home, France.\n\"If the American public funds the life-saving intervention, we need price protections for states that have to foot the bill,\" Gee says.\nLast week, several groups including Doctors without Borders and Knowledge Ecology International appealed to the Army to delay granting Sanofi the exclusive license until the company agrees to reasonable price terms.\nZika is a virus that is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. It can cause severe defects to babies born to infected mothers.\nBecause of its hot, wet climate, Louisiana is a prime target for the Zika virus in this country, Gee says. If there were a local outbreak, the state would want to ensure that every person of childbearing age got vaccinated. And today, there are about 540,000 people of reproductive age on Louisiana's Medicaid rolls, which means the state and federal governments would cover the costs to vaccinate them.\nThere's no vaccine against Zika available yet. So there is no way to determine where Sanofi, or any other company may set the price. But if it were too high?\n\"We'd then be in a situation where we'd have to decide between funding for K-12 education and the Zika vaccine,\" Gee says. \"And that just shouldn't happen when the U.S. government and the taxpayers of this nation paid to develop this drug.\"\nIt's actually not unusual for the government to give private companies an exclusive license to government research and inventions to develop medications. In most cases, however, the government has paid for only part of the development.\nIn the case of the Zika vaccine, the government's contribution is much larger.\n\"The inventors of the vaccine are all federal employees — they're all employees of the army,\" says Jamie Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a non-profit public interest group.\nKnowledge Ecology and other groups filed a formal appeal earlier this month. They want the Army to require Sanofi to give U.S. buyers a fair price — charging the same price here as it charges in other wealthy countries — like its home country France. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards also asked the Army for such a guarantee.\nThe groups have been pressing the Army for months over the proposed license. The Army wrote in an April 21 letter that it has to give the company exclusivity because of the \"high risk and high costs involved in advanced vaccine development.\"\nThose costs aren't clear however, at least when it comes to Sanofi.\n\"It's not obvious what they've done,\" Love says of Sanofi. \"They didn't invent the vaccine, they didn't do the Phase 1 [clinical trial]. They're not paying for the Phase II or III trials.\"\nThe Army right now is conducting the Phase I trial, intended to determine whether the vaccine is safe.\nIf that goes well, the Department of Health and Human Services will give Sanofi $43 million for a Phase II trial, which determines whether the vaccine actually works and whether it has side effects.\nAnd HHS is offering up another $130 million for the Phase III trial if the second stage is successful.\nSanofi says it has devoted 60 scientists to the project full time and is using \"proprietary technical manufacturing expertise,\" as well as the clinical trial network it has developed over the years in testing other vaccines to help with the studies.\n\"So while it's true that those costs are being paid for by the U.S. government, we do have substantial investments in this vaccine,\" says Dr. Jon Heinrichs, an associated vice president at Sanofi Pasteur in Pennsylvania, where he leads vaccine development.\n\"And really what it costs us are the opportunity costs where those individuals could be working on projects that have a more certain commercial return,\" he says. \"And while they're working on Zika, they can't be working on those projects.\"\nIt's still not certain the vaccine developed by the Army will work, or that there will be a market for it in the end, he says. There are many other efforts to develop Zika vaccines, some of which have government funding, and it's not clear which will be most effective. Plus viruses can mutate, so a vaccine that is effective this year may not be in the future.\nAnd Elias Zerhouni, a former director of the National Institutes of Health and president of global research and development at Sanofi said in a letter to the New York Times that the company will pay royalties to the Army for the license, so the government can recoup its investment.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, isn't impressed with Sanofi's arguments. He has been urging the Army to withhold the license from Sanofi until the company agrees to charge U.S. customers a fair price.\n\"It seems to me that if we are providing substantial amounts of money to a company to distribute and develop this drug that the American people should be guaranteed that they're going to be able to afford the price of the vaccine,\" Sanders tells Shots. \"And currently that is not the case.\"\nSanders says the Army has asked Sanofi for a guarantee that it will charge U.S. customers, including state and federal public health and Medicaid programs, no more than it charges other wealthy countries for the vaccine. And the company, Sanders says, refused.\n\"Well, you know, we have not refused,\" Heinrichs says. \"And we intend to make this vaccine available at a reasonable price. And I think our record stands, and that we have made many of our vaccines available to those who need them at affordable prices.\"\nThe Army did not respond to multiple calls to its Medical Research and Material Command at Ft. Detrick, Md., where the Zika work is happening.\nBut in a letter to Knowledge Ecology, Barry Datlof, chief of the Army's Office of Research and Technology Applications, said the Army had talked with several companies and Sanofi \"was the only one to move forward\" with executing the collaborative research agreement and submitting a license application.\nHe said Sanofi, as a private company, has to make such decisions on the potential profit it can earn.\n\"Considering the high risk and the high cost involved in advanced vaccine development, granting an exclusive license for federally developed technology is often the only incentive significant enough to attract a competent and willing commercial partner,\" Datlof wrote.\nLove argues that the government could hold off on granting the license to the vaccine until after the next round of clinical trials. At that point, its value would be more clear and the Army will be in a better bargaining position.\nSanders and Knowledge Ecology point out that Sanofi has charged more in the U.S. for many medications, including the multiple sclerosis drug Aubagio, which costs Medicare more than $5,000, but in France it's priced at about $745.\n\"Sanofi wants to do business the old-fashioned way, and that is take taxpayers money and then charge any price that they want,\" Sanders says. \"Our job now is to make it clear that what Sanofi wants it not acceptable.\""},{"url":"http://thephiladelphiacitizen.org/jewelers-row-philadelphia","title":"Jewelers Row and a Larger Debate About How Philly Wants to Grow","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Philadelphia Citizen","description":"What’s lost in the debate over the fate of Jewelers Row is a larger debate about how Philly really wants to grow.","date":"2016-10-21","full_text":"At this moment in time—when our presidential election is unfathomably dispiriting, when the world is experiencing an unprecedented refugee crisis, and tens of thousands of people are being bombed in Syria—the battle over whether to demolish five buildings on Sansom Street feels quaint, even indulgent.\nBut those buildings, on Sansom between 7th and 8th streets, known as Jewelers Row, are symbols and touchstones, meaning much more than they appear. They’ve garnered such attention from local and national media because these buildings get at the central question of who decides how Philadelphia looks and how it is governed.\nThe kerfuffle began when Toll Brothers, a real estate development company that recently pivoted to producing agreeable urban condos after decades of building McMansions, announced plans to construct a 16-story residential tower by demolishing five buildings in a historic area. Toll Brothers can build the tower because the street is, like most of Center City’s core commercial streets, zoned for skyscrapers and other high-density buildings. It’s a zoning designation that never should have been applied to Jewelers Row in the first place; but short of the city admitting this mistake and retroactively applying a preservation overlay, there is nothing that can be done to protect the buildings other than hope enough public pressure will force city government to step in.\nMayor Kenney has responded to advocacy groups by saying in a statement that he “share[s] the frustration” about the situation, and urging Toll Brothers to preserve the facades of the extant buildings. Other than that, Kenney essentially said, “Carry on.”\nWhile well-meaning, this idealized urban life becomes a kind of fetish. It’s one thing to admire the foresight and common-sense intelligence of Jane Jacobs’ praise of the small, old, and independent. It’s another to fetishize it, turning these perfect places into “comfort urbanism” to avoid thinking about the realities of the market forces at play.\nSo, the story should end there. But people are very angry about Jewelers Row, and perhaps precisely because we are living in such dire times, people fear that losing this little bit of the city’s physical history, and the human pace of life that goes along with it, will be one concession too many to the neoliberal, market-driven economy. Small-scale streets, historic architecture, and small businesses are what make Philly unique and gorgeous—and they are what reminds us of what it is to be human.\nIndeed, it is the Jewelers Row way of life that some feel is most threatened by the project. For Inga Saffron, the Inquirer’s architecture critic, Jewelers Row is about more than the buildings, but about the businesses. These are longtime tenants, small business owners who work in collaboration with each other in a tight ecosystem. One need look only half a block away at the sterile Penn Medicine tower at 8th and Walnut streets, or Jefferson University’s encroachment on the neighborhood, to feel how architecture and livelihoods are intertwined, and how the “knowledge economy” often fails to produce engaging architecture. Removing this last bit of the manufacturing and artisan past of the city would be a shame.\nBut underneath the conversation about the built environment and economy is a subtler conversation about how to construct a “Goldilocks” city—one that’s not too hot and not too cold. Not so much development that it changes the character of the city; not so little development there’s no growth. Commercial corridors that are vibrant, but not overtly bourgeois. Urban-scaled Target stores, but not outlets in the Gallery. New townhouse developments, but not the ones that are too big and have parking.\nThis kind of commentary, found on Facebook chat rooms like UrbanPHL and in the discussion surrounding Jewelers Row, comes from people who ardently champion the “back to the city” movement, but then wring their hands when suburbanites actually do move to the city and bring their aesthetics and their values with them.\nWhile well-meaning, this idealized urban life becomes a kind of fetish. It’s one thing to admire the foresight and common-sense intelligence of Jane Jacobs’ praise of the small, old, and independent. It’s another to fetishize it, turning these perfect places into “comfort urbanism” to avoid thinking about the realities of the market forces at play. I can see in the near future how this cohort will try to keep Starbucks and other multinational brands from poisoning Passyunk Avenue and Frankford Avenue, meanwhile only displacing the demand elsewhere. (Think of Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, which fought for its bookstores and co-ops, only to see downtown Brooklyn become yet another generic mall.)\nWe’d do much better as a city if we would adjust our focus from microdevelopment to the macrogovernance forces at play. Instead of whining about Jewelers Row, let’s take that energy and apply it to advocating for more equitable development writ large in the city. Let’s take on the 10-year tax abatement, which Paul Steinke, head of the Preservation Alliance, has duly noted is a major culprit behind the real estate climate in which historic, tax-paying structures—like old rowhomes and storefronts—are at a financial disadvantage to new, tax-abated properties. Adjusting, or even eliminating, the tax abatement would do much to level the playing field between old and new properties, so developers like Toll Brothers are less encouraged to demolish.\nDon’t want Philly to lose its small scale? Instead of touting the major hotel projects like the SLS Lux Hotel \u0026 Residences and W and Element Hotels, let’s dive into the tax grants, credits and deals that make those projects possible. Or, as is the case of the SLS, whose site sat fallow waiting for a $20 million state grant that didn’t materialize this fall, not possible.Broad Street is a much more visible and trafficked avenue than Jewelers Row, but the level of concern from the design community over the questionable architecture on Broad Street seems entirely inadequate.\nFinally, we can and should do more to ensure our streets don’t lose independent businesses, but we must also find ways to get those businesses to move beyond the small commercial corridors. Often, out-of-town developers, unfamiliar with local businesses won’t consider anything but national chains as “credit tenants” to sign multi-year leases for large retail spaces. We need our local community development financial institutions, such as Reinvestment Fund and PIDC, as well as potentially philanthropic groups to step up to the plate and guarantee loans for these businesses. Unless we find ways to help small businesses scale up and expand into larger retail spaces, developers will fill their storefronts with Santander or CVS, making those unique places like Passyunk, Frankford, and, yes, Jewelers Row, a little too precious.\nHeader photo by Terry Robinson via Flickr"},{"url":"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/analysis/2017/04/24/more-safeguards-needed-to-build-on-health-record-provisions-in-21st-century-cures-act","title":"More Safeguards Needed to Build on Health Record Provisions in 21st Century Cures Act","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Electronic health records (EHRs) are intended to improve patient care, but usability issues—including both product design and how the technology fits into a clinician’s workflow—can place patients at risk.

Some EHR systems, for example, have default dosage settings that have led to accidental overdoses. Others display only test results that have returned from the lab, not those that are pending, leading doctors to potentially miss information that may be critical to a patient’s treatment.\nTo address this problem, Pew supports the creation of a national health IT safety collaborative, a concept initially proposed by experts from the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine). The collaborative would work with patient safety organizations, software vendors, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), and health care providers to identify the most common and significant safety issues associated with EHR systems across the health care industry and develop solutions to address them.\nThe 21st Century Cures Act (Cures), passed by Congress in December of 2016, contained a provision that gives EHR vendors the same legal protections available for health care providers if they report a problem to a patient safety organization. These safeguards can help encourage EHR vendors to share concerns to improve safety and can serve as a building block for establishing a health IT safety collaborative. This collaborative would benefit from congressional legislation to authorize and provide initial seed funding. Ultimately, it would become a self-sustaining entity.\nMore rigorous testing of electronic health record systems could also improve how they are used and help protect patient safety. Another provision of Cures requires the federal government to create criteria for EHR developers to use in evaluating a system’s performance, including its usability. These criteria should incorporate product safety considerations. Many EHR vendors test their products’ ability to perform necessary functions, such as prescribing medication or reporting lab test results, but not the safety of those functions—such as ensuring that a patient gets the correct dose of a drug.\nThe reporting and usability provisions in Cures set the groundwork for additional work by the private sector and government to improve EHR safety. As this legislation is implemented, ONC, vendors, and health care providers should take the next step by incorporating more safeguards into how systems are designed and used and by working together to establish a health IT safety collaborative.\nBen Moscovitch is a manager with The Pew Charitable Trusts’ health information technology program."},{"url":"https://ensia.com/features/10-things-need-know-new-u-s-chemicals-law","title":"10 things you need to know about the new U.S. chemicals law","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Ensia","description":"The updated Toxic Substances Control Act brings new hope for protecting Americans’ health and environment. Here's what it does — and doesn’t — do.","date":"","full_text":"Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act to honor the late senator for whom this was a special cause, the law revises the Toxic Substances Control Act that gives the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency authority to regulate chemicals used commercially in the United States.\nAs Obama noted at the June 22 signing ceremony, TSCA was supposed to ensure that chemicals used in the U.S. were safe for human health and the environment. But, said the president, “Even with the best of intentions, the law didn’t quite work the way it should have in practice.”\nIn fact, TSCA allowed the approximately 62,000 chemicals already on the market when it was passed in 1976 to continue being used without safety testing. It also placed enormously high hurdles for the EPA to clear before demonstrating a chemical was hazardous enough to ban. Even asbestos has failed to meet those requirements. It was widely agreed, by industry and environmental advocates alike that TSCA was badly in need of revision.\nAs the Lautenberg Act’s lead sponsor Senator Tom Udall told Ensia by email, “Most Americans believe that if they can buy a product at the grocery store or the hardware store, the government has tested it and determined that it’s safe. But that hasn’t been true. There has been no cop on the beat testing chemicals to make sure they’re safe — even the ones in your home.”\nBut exactly what the revisions should look like was a matter of considerable debate, and the new legislation was years in the making. Overall, the revised TSCA gives the EPA far more authority to act on hazardous chemicals. And while questions and reservations about the bill remain on all sides, it’s largely been greeted with hope that the new law will enable the EPA to do a better job of evaluating and acting effectively on chemical safety.\nEPA is already putting the new legislation into practice. But as Environmental Defense Fund lead senior scientist Richard Denison said, “It’s not going to be an overnight process. The original law dug a very deep hole that we have to climb out of.”\nAs that process gets underway, here’s what anyone concerned about the safety of chemicals we all encounter daily, should know about what the new TSCA will — and won’t — do:\n1. What does TSCA regulate?\nTSCA regulates chemicals used commercially in the United States. That said, TSCA does not regulate pesticides, chemicals used in cosmetics and personal care products, food, food packaging, or pharmaceuticals. Some chemicals, however, have multiple uses and so may be regulated concurrently by TSCA and other federal laws. For example, TSCA regulates the plastics ingredient bisphenol A when it’s used as a receipt paper coating, but the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act regulates BPA when it’s used in food packaging.\n2. Will the new law make it easier for the EPA to restrict or ban use of highly toxic chemicals?\nUnlike the old law, the new TSCA requires EPA to review the safety of all chemicals used commercially in the U.S. “The EPA is actually required to look at existing chemicals,” says Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, director of the EPA’s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. “Under the old TSCA there was no mandate that the EPA look at existing chemicals. That’s huge.”\nThe new TSCA “gives EPA sweeping new authority to prioritize and evaluate existing chemicals so it will be easier for EPA to regulate these substances, if found to pose unreasonable risks,” says chemical regulation expert Lynn Bergeson, managing partner at the law firm Bergeson \u0026 Campbell.\nThe EPA must also review all new chemicals and decide if they present “an unreasonable risk” to human health and the environment. If such risks are found, the EPA may restrict or ban a chemical. Under the old TSCA, chemical manufacturers had to submit certain information to the EPA before new chemicals could go on the market — but unless the EPA raised objections within 90 days, the chemicals could be sold without further scrutiny. According to the EPA, the agency has taken action on only about 10 percent of the nearly 40,000 new chemicals submitted to the agency between 1979 and September 30, 2015. EDF’s Denison says this 10 percent may be an overestimate.\nNow new chemicals must be found safe before they can be sold, says Environmental Working Group legislative attorney Melanie Benesh.\nWhat the EPA does under the Lautenberg Act will, however, also depend on available funding. The law requires the chemical industry to help pay for the program, but the EPA also depends on federal budgets as determined by Congress. Udall says he “will be fighting to make sure the EPA has the resources it needs to do its job.”\n3. Will the new law let EPA restrict or ban use of highly toxic chemicals more quickly?\nYes — in theory. The new law requires the EPA to prioritize chemicals for evaluation. It also sets enforceable deadlines for the EPA’s chemical reviews.\nBy mid-December 2016 (within the bill’s first 180 days) the EPA must have begun to review at least 10 chemicals. These will come from a list of existing chemicals the agency had already decided to evaluate. Within the first three-and-a-half years, the EPA must have 20 ongoing chemical evaluations. Reviews are supposed to be completed within three years, but that deadline can be extended six months. The EPA is supposed to issue any regulations within two years after that. The EPA can extend either of these deadlines but extensions for one chemical can’t add up to more than two years.\nGiven the enormous backlog, progress through the untested chemicals will still be slow — to say the least. In fact doing the math on 62,000 chemicals shows it could take the EPA centuries to work through every substance. But given that the old TSCA had no chemical review deadlines, the Lautenberg Act aims to improve substantially on the decades-long reviews of single chemicals that occurred under its predecessor.\n4. What chemical hazards is the new TSCA designed to protect us from?\nThe first chemicals the EPA will evaluate must come from a list the agency has already decided merit review — chemicals that pose concerns for children’s health, are carcinogenic, environmentally persistent, toxic and build up in fat or other living tissue, or are widely found in biomonitoring programs.\nWhen choosing chemicals to review, the EPA must give priority to those with large exposure potential, those that are environmentally persistent and bioaccumulate, and those that are stored near important drinking water sources.After that, when choosing chemicals to review, the EPA must give priority to those with large exposure potential, those that are environmentally persistent and bioaccumulate, and those that are stored near important drinking water sources. The new law also tells the EPA to address chemicals that are likely to pose health and safety threats to those considered most vulnerable — including infants, children, pregnant women, workers and the elderly.\nAdditional criteria for chemical prioritization are due from the EPA by June 2017.\n5. What chemical hazards will the new TSCA leave untouched, if any?\nThe new law authorizes the EPA to review all existing and new chemicals, to identify those that pose unreasonable risks, and to regulate or eliminate those risks. The goal is to leave no unreasonable risk untouched. The details of EPA’s risk evaluations, however, have still to be worked out in a rule that must be completed by June 2017. These — along with the additional chemical prioritization criteria — will play a big role in determining exactly how effective the Lautenberg Act will be at reducing exposure to hazardous chemicals.\n6. Will the new law do a better job of preventing disastrous chemical spills?\nWhile TSCA is not intended to address or prevent chemical spills, the new law’s requirements should eventually help reduce the impact of spills or other accidents. Among these is the requirement that chemical companies disclose their products’ contents in emergencies rather than claim such information as trade secrets.\n7. Will the new law keep hazardous materials out of furniture, clothing and personal care products?\nBecause some chemicals used in these products (which aren’t covered by TSCA) have additional uses that fall under TSCA’s purview, the upgraded review process could potentially avert hazardous chemicals’ use in a wide range of consumer products.\n8. Is the new TSCA likely to proactively change chemical companies’ practices?\nBecause the new TSCA requires all chemicals to be evaluated, it’s expected to influence which chemicals are chosen as product ingredients, how chemicals are used in manufacturing and how chemicals are manufactured as companies try to avoid using chemicals likely to be restricted or banned. This may also create an incentive for new, safer chemicals and finished products.\n9. What are its implications with respect to environmental justice?\nThe new TSCA requires the EPA to consider impacts of chemical exposures on those most “susceptible” to these effects, “such as infants, children, pregnant women, workers, or the elderly.’’ How the EPA defines “susceptible” and “vulnerable” and how it considers impacts to these groups is yet to be determined. But already, public interest groups have asked the EPA to consider social and economic factors.\n10. What aspects have yet to be settled, and what can citizens do to influence them?\nInstead of hammering out chemical prioritization criteria and the details of how the EPA will evaluate chemical risks before the Lautenberg Act was passed, lawmakers decided to leave those to rules that will become part of the overall law. The rule-making process involves official public comment periods, so the EPA will be considering those as it writes these rules, along with a rule about potential chemical industry fees that will go toward covering some of the law’s costs. Initial public comment periods for these rules are already closed. The law also includes public comment periods before the EPA finalizes these rules, as well as for ongoing chemical selections and evaluations.\nAnd, points out Kathy Curtis, Clean and Healthy New York executive director, the new law leaves ample room for continued action on the part of state legislatures and citizens. This includes action on chemical uses TSCA doesn’t regulate and new bills on chemical use reporting — both of which have been instrumental in influencing which chemicals get used in consumer products.\nAs many have cautioned, substantive changes will take time. But according to the EPA’s Cleland-Hamnett, the new law opens the potential for “a huge increase in human health and environmental protection.” But this won’t happen without public engagement on the part of those with a stake in the outcome — essentially, all of us."},{"url":"http://www.sfchronicle.com/restaurants/article/Monsieur-Benjamin-How-much-will-you-pay-for-11185931.php","title":"Monsieur Benjamin: How much will you pay for classic cuisine?","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"San Francisco Chronicle","description":"Whether an expensive dinner is worth the cost is a feeling affected by the surroundings, service, attention to detail and, most important, what arrives on the plate.

He was released on personal recognizance and is due back in court July 7. Marchant has been placed on unpaid administrative leave, a spokeswoman for the Trial Court said Thursday. She declined to comment further.\nMarchant could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Tracy Dudevoir, did not return a telephone message.\nMarchant and eight other men were arrested as part of an undercover operation by the Boston Police Department’s human trafficking unit.\nProsecutors said each of the men responded to a decoy online advertisement posted on backpage.com, a popular classified ad site that has also been used for sexual solicitation. The site, which closed its adult advertising section in January, has been criticized by political leaders and human rights advocates for allowing ads that promote the solicitation of minors.\nThe men arrested Tuesday responded to ads offering sex with a woman for fees ranging between $130 and $200.\nMarchant answered the ad and texted the undercover detective who told him to come to 20 Pine St., according to prosecutors. When he arrived, he was approached by police.\n“Human trafficking exists because sex buyers make it profitable,” Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said in a statement. “Part of our strategy is making clear that there are personal, social, and legal consequences for that behavior. If you come into Suffolk County to buy sex, you aren’t just participating in an industry that thrives on exploitation, you’re risking arrest and prosecution.”\nUnder state law, the maximum penalty for soliciting sex is 2½ years in county jail and a maximum fine of $5,000.\nMarchant’s department prepares and receives budget requests throughout the Trial Court and process the financial transactions for the agency’s court divisions. Marchant earned $156,638 in fiscal 2016, according to state records.\nMarchant, who lives in Norwood, is also the owner of Green Flooring Services, a carpet and upholstery cleaning company in Norwood. Marchant listed that occupation on his booking sheet, but not his job at the Trial Court.\nIn 2014, Marchant testified for the prosecution in the federal trial of former probation commissioner John J. O’Brien, who was accused of offering jobs to the friends and family members of state legislators in exchange for legislative favors.\nOn the stand, Marchant said that funding for the Probation Department rose significantly in 2009 even though the state was entering a fiscal crisis and other departments in the court system faced budget cuts.\nAlso arrested Tuesday was Bishop A. Livingston Foxworth, a well-known Dorchester pastor whose Pentecostal church, Grace Church of All Nations, is regularly visited by high-profile politicians and ministers.\nWhen Governor Charlie Baker was sworn into office in the House chamber in January 2015, Foxworth delivered the benediction. The Rev. Jesse Jackson visited the church in April.\nA man who answered the phone at the church Thursday declined to comment on the case. He would not identify himself.\nBaker’s spokeswoman, Lizzy Guyton, said the governor is “saddened by this news and is confident the courts will examine the facts and reach an appropriate decision.”\nBaker “has made combating human trafficking a priority by working across state government to enact anti-trafficking policies and proposing legislation to give law enforcement more tools to crack down on trafficking-related crimes,” she said.\nMaria Cramer can be reached at mcramer@globe.com.

The Huskies made an historical run through the playoffs and reached Region 1-5A championship series where it fell to Canyon in a best two-of-three series last week in Seminole.\nThe Huskies were led by a strong senior group in Alyssa Lozoya, Nazareth Fierro and Ariana Valles and have a strong underclassmen nucleus returning next year led by Kristin Fifield and Jazmyn Armendariz.\nCoronado went from last to first in District 1-6A and also made a tremendous run in the state playoffs where it reached the Region 1-6A semifinals. The Thunderbirds had several key standouts this year including power hitter Abigale Carney, pitcher Alexis Hamilton and talented slugger Jacqueline Fournier.\nEastlake also had a fine season by reaching the regional quarterfinals and the future looks bright for the Falcons, who won the District 2-5A title\nIn baseball, Montwood and Socorro paved the way for the city. Both teams reached the Class 6A regional quarterfinals. The Rams were one of the city's best all season long and were the most consistent, led by a strong core of seniors including Miguel Soto, Eric Estrada and Miguel Soto.\nSocorro could very well be the favorite to win district next season with a talented core of underclassmen returning.\nFaith Christian also had a strong season by winning the Texas Christian Athletic League championship for the third straight year. The Lions were very good this season and showed they could compete at a high level against some of the city's top teams.\nIn high school tennis, Franklin junior Sebastian Herrera proved he will be a force to be reckoned with as a senior as he earned a bid to the Class 6A state tournament.\nIn track and field, Hanks' Michael Abeyta won Gold in the 1,600 meters in Class 5A to cap a strong year El Paso athletes in track and field. Burges' Arielle Mack earned two medals in the long and triple jump, San Elizario's Erick Arambula got bronze in the 3,200 meters in 4A, Eastwood's Daniel Bernal got bronze in Class 6A in the 3,200 meters and Chapin's Shailah Thornton earned bronze in the 5A 100 meter hurdles.\nBasketball saw another successful season. The Burges boys lost in the Region 1-5A title game to Justin Northwest and Andress just missed out on a trip to the regional final by losing to Justin Northwest in the semifinals in overtime.\nThe Andress and Burges girls basketball teams both reached the regional quarterfinals in Class 5A after sharing the District 1-5A titles.\nCathedral boys basketball coach Tony Harper won his 1,000th career game this past season and Andress boys hoops coach Jim Forbes earned his 600th career win.\nIn boys and girls soccer, several teams had great seasons. The San Elizario boys in Class 4A and Del Valle boys in Class 5A both reached regional title matches.

Jason Chaffetz, whose attempts to overturn D.C. legislation inspired a “Hands Off D.C.” campaign led by local officials, is leaving town next month.\nThe Utah Republican, who heads the House committee which oversees District affairs, announced Thursday that he will resign June 30, advancing his planned departure from Congress by six months. The 50-year-old congressman had already announced he wouldn’t be seeking re-election this year. His early exit means District officials will have a new unofficial overseer to reckon with this summer.\nSince D.C. is a federal district — and not a state — Congress gets the final say over the city’s laws\nFor the past three years, the congressman with the most say has been Chaffetz. Mainly he’s tried to say no.\nHe has tried to overturn the District’s laws on decriminalizing marijuana and legalizing assisted suicide for the terminally ill and (before the Supreme Court made it the law of the land) gay marriage. His attempts to overturn those laws fell short in large part because of the threat of a filibuster by Senate Democrats.\nEarlier this year, D.C. Council expressed their exasperation with a tongue-in-cheek move, creating a nameplate for Chaffetz so he could have his own seat on the Council dais.\nBut if you expect Council members to pop champagne over Chaffetz’s surprise resignation, think again.\n“We can celebrate for maybe one night,” says Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), who helped organize the “Hands Off D.C.” campaign in response to Chaffetz’s unsuccessful effort to overturn the Death with Dignity law. “But it doesn’t change the fact we don’t control our own destiny, and that Congress can intervene with our local laws or our local dollars anytime they want.\nAmong the front-runners to take over Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairmanship that Chaffetz is vacating: Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Like Chaffetz, Jordan has demonstrated an eagerness for getting involved in DC’s laws. In Jordan’s case, it’s the District’s gun control laws, which he has twice sponsored legislation to overturn.\nOne potential competitor to Jordan is Rep. Trey Gowdy. The South Carolina Republican is best known for his role as chairman of the Benghazi Committee that spearheaded a controversial investigation of then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. But as a congressional freshman, Gowdy chaired the House Oversight subcommittee on D.C. affairs and won praise from D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton for his hands-off approach to district affairs."},{"url":"https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/05/28/when-youre-undocumented-and-asian-youre-invisible","title":"‘When You’re Undocumented and Asian, You’re Invisible’","author_text":null,"keywords":["Daca","U.S. Immigration And Customs Enforcement","Undocumented Immigrants","Immigration","News"],"publication_text":"KQED News","description":"DACA changed Alvin's life five years ago. But with Trump in office, it makes him fear deportation again.","date":"2017-05-28","full_text":"This story is part of “At Risk in the Trump Era,” a four-month investigation by USC Annenberg advanced radio students, exploring how vulnerable communities across Southern California react to the first months of Donald Trump’s presidency. The series profiles individuals burdened by new worries — looking for work, signing up for school, or even deciding whether to publicly express their sexual orientation or religious affiliation.\nStefanie De Leon Tzic brings us a story about Alvin, a young Indonesian Dreamer. He says being Asian and undocumented has been one of the most isolating experiences of his life. He asked us to use only his first name to avoid putting his parents at risk.\nColorful Hot Wheels collector cars, some in their original packaging, are scattered around Alvin’s room. On his desk, a matchbox display case with his favorites — hot rods, coups and convertibles. But none compare to his most valuable possession, the Nissan 240SX — his real car.\nAlvin has always loved cars.\n“When I was a kid, I didn’t even play with, like, action figures or anything. The only toys I touched were toys that had wheels with them,” he says.\nFive years ago, he couldn’t drive his car without the constant fear of getting pulled over, getting his car taken away, or even getting deported. That’s because Alvin is an undocumented Dreamer. He has temporary protection from deportation under President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.\nBut President Trump has sent mixed signals about Dreamers, and Alvin worries his protection could be taken away.\n“Not having Deferred Action is like a roadblock for me to even want to drive a car because I don’t want to get in trouble with the cops,” says Alvin.\nHis parents brought him to the U.S. from Indonesia when he was 2. The family overstayed their tourist visas.\nThey wanted to escape the poverty that surrounded them back home. Alvin’s dad also wanted to leave the toxic environment he grew up in. He was physically abused by his parents for most of his life. Alvin says his dad sometimes has flashbacks.\nWhen his parents first arrived, they didn’t know anyone. Just a faraway “friend of a friend” who owned a restaurant in Los Angeles and was also Indonesian.\n“We actually lived at the restaurant for about three months. My parents worked at the restaurant during business hours and at night we would go up to the attic and sleep,” recalls Alvin.\nFor decades, the family lived in the shadows. His parents kept their heads down and worked to put Alvin through school.\nWhen Alvin was in high school, he began looking for legal help so the family could try to adjust their immigration status. He says it was hard to find resources for undocumented immigrants who weren’t Latino.\n“You go to lawyers and they’re all like, ‘Oh yeah, we have this support system for you and especially we can cater to you if you speak Spanish.’ What about us?”\nThe attorneys told him there was nothing his family could do. They didn’t have any family members that could petition for their residency. Even if they did, waiting for a visa could take decades. Just like for immigrants from Mexico. But Alvin didn’t feel like he could connect with the Latino community.\n“It sucked especially because, like, you go through all these struggles, and you can’t really feel like you identify with other folks who also go through that struggle, so you just kind of, like, stay in your own pocket of [the] world,” he says. “It’s like you’re a double minority.”\nBut DACA changed his life.\n“To be real, it probably has been the biggest life-changer for me,” says Alvin. “It’s not just a work permit. It’s literally the freedom of being able to go out there and do [things] without being scared to get caught.”\nNow in his late 20s, Alvin works as an accountant for a car company and is the sole provider for his family. He says his aging parents have a hard time doing manual labor in restaurants anymore. But he also doesn’t want them to risk a workplace immigration raid now that Trump is in office. DACA protects only him from deportation. Not his parents.\nAfter Trump’s inauguration, he took his parents to a “Know Your Rights” forum to prepare for what to do in case ICE agents show up at their house.\nIt’s hard for Alvin to imagine what would happen if he and his parents were to get deported. He doesn’t feel like Indonesia is home, and he doesn’t want his dad to go back to the environment where he experienced such trauma.\nIn the meantime, he finds comfort in car culture.\nHe hangs out at an auto body shop, tinkering with his car. Most of his buddies there are African-American. When he’s around them, he can forget about his immigration woes. Even if it’s just for a moment. Because being undocumented is just one part of who he is."},{"url":"http://www.wnyc.org/story/kids-prison-we-profile-former-minor-adult-prison-now-hes-out","title":"Kids in Prison: We Profile a Former Inmate, Now That He's Out","author_text":null,"keywords":["Npr","New York","Wnyc","Arts","Culture","News","Public","Radio"],"publication_text":"WNYC","description":"Part 5: Despite turning his life around in prison, Trevor's adult criminal record (for a crime he committed as a minor) ...","date":"","full_text":"Trevor shot a gang member six times when he was a minor, 17.

But then his defense attorney posed the question that upended the case.","date":"","full_text":"By the time prosecutors were done charging Bradford Harrington last year, he almost seemed to need a tabloid nickname to convey the sordid, predatory nature of the accusations.\nDetectives say Harrington, 50, of Milwaukee's Bay View neighborhood, would search online for women jailed on chargesof prostitution or drugs and cultivate favor by sending money to their jail accounts. Once they got out, he would help them get drugs like heroin and ultimately hire them for sex at hotels or his home on S. Quincy Ave., detectives say. Typically, Harrington would photograph or record them injecting heroin and having sex with him.\nFrom January to June, in six separate cases, the Milwaukee County District Attorney's office filed more than 50 counts, mostly felonies, ranging from soliciting prostitution and secretly recording sex acts, to sexual assault, drug delivery and possession of child porn.\nA judge granted the state's motion to combine all six cases into one big trial focused on Harrington's alleged exploitation of desperate, addicted women.\nBut then defense attorney Craig Mastantuono raised a big question: Did a detective mislead the judge who granted a search warrant for Harrington's house and garage that led to the only real physical evidence?\nA key claim in the detective's affidavit was that one of the women, a 26-year-old with several past convictions for theft and fraud, said she had never agreed to be filmed having sex, or to have the video posted on the internet. She described Harrington driving her to buy heroin, and asking to watch her make the purchase, and giving her Xanax and wearing a gun in an ankle holster during sex.\nBut the same woman later told a defense investigator she lied about Harrington assaulting her, and videotaping her without consent only because she felt angry toward him after the detective told her Harrington had posted the video on the internet.\nBut that, too, was a lie. There is no evidence Harrington made the video public. That led Mastantuono to argue that all the charges must be dismissed, since they all depended on evidence discovered only after the search warrant granted on the basis of an untruthful affidavit.\nBefore Circuit Judge Jeffrey Wagner ever ruled on the motion, it led to more plea bargaining and finally an agreement in which Harrington would plead to three lower-level felonies.\nRELATED: ‘Off the charts’ mayhem brings 50-year sentence in torture of Milwaukee woman\nAccording to the complaints, about 10 women made accusations against Harrington after investigators found their identities among items taken from his home pursuant to the challenged search warrant.\nOne told detectives Harrington would look for women arrested on prostitution charges and deposit money to their jail accounts so they would feel obligated to him after getting out. Jail officials noticed that inmates made hundreds of calls to his cell phone.\nSome of the women told detectives they were too high during sex to consent to being recorded, but Harrington insisted all of them, all adults, willingly had sex for money and knew he was recording because he was holding a camera during sex.\nHidden cameras, Narcan\nBut Harrington also had some hidden cameras in his garage, and at least one woman seen in photos inside the garage said she did not realize she was being photographed and would not have allowed it. Other women told investigators they charged Harrington extra to record their sexual encounters.\nOne complaint indicated that Harrington admitted keeping Narcan — a drug that reverses the effects of opioid overdose — at his house and in his car because he \"doesn't want a dead girlfriend on his hands.\"\nAnother case charged Harrington with manufacturing designer drugs, and keeping a drug house, based on the presence of eight salvia plants and some dried salvia in his home. He told detectives he grew the plants because they were \"on the edge of naughty,\" but neither used nor sold the dried salvia.\nA woman told police that Harrington told her he kept the salvia around for whoever might want some at his home. The plant, a member of the sage family, can produce hallucinogenic effects when smoked. It is not regulated by federal law but is illegal in some states.\nThe same complaint also listed in great detail the guns and ammunition found at Harrington's home, though he was never charged with any firearms offenses. Police did seize all the firearms.\nIn court Friday, Mastantuono told Wagner that Harrington had agreed to plead guilty to two counts from one complaint — soliciting a prostitute and capturing an image of nudity without consent — and keeping a drug house.\nAt a sentencing still to be scheduled, the defense and prosecution will jointly recommend three years of prison and three years of extended supervision, according to the plea agreement.\nThe state, in turn, would dismiss the dozens of other counts. At the last minute in Friday's hearing, confusion arose as to whether the child pornography counts would be \"read in\" as part of sentencing, or dismissed outright, and the hearing was reset for Tuesday.\nHaving the counts dismissed but \"read in\" as part of sentencing would actually be to Harrington's benefit, because it means the charges couldn't later be refiled if prosecutors found ways to prove the charges that didn't depend on the challenged search warrant.\nSoliciting carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison and three years of supervision. Capturing a nude image without consent, and maintaining a drug trafficking place, have maximum penalties of 18 months in prison, plus two years of supervision. The original charges carried a collective maximum prison time of about 700 years."},{"url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2017/05/30/low-inventory-and-rising-prices-are-forcing-many-home-buyers-to-become-less-picky","title":"Analysis | Low inventory and rising prices are forcing many home buyers to become less picky","author_text":null,"keywords":["David Charron Of Bright Mls; Buying A House In The Washington","D.C.

We are still short on inventory, and rising home prices have made it difficult for first-time buyers to purchase. Interest rates are on an upward trend, which will make mortgages more expensive over the long term, and student loan debt continues to be a significant burden for many buyers. Despite all this, local real estate agents report they are still optimistic for a successful year because a number of other positive forces are in play.\nOur annual survey of local real estate professionals asks for their honest opinion about both the positive and negative forces affecting our market, and this year a full 63 percent said they expect this year to be a busier — and more positive — market than last year.\nThe No. 1 reason for optimism cited by agents was the improved job market. A few years ago, many different industries had a tenuous hold on their profit margins and had to cut back on hiring, as well as raises or cost of living increases. All three of these factors have improved this year, compared with previous ones, which placed many potential buyers in a much safer financial position.\nAfter improved job market, agents cited the increase of first-time buyers and more qualified buyers as the second and third reasons on the list. Both of these groups have finally saved up enough to make a larger down payment, and more of them have had a few extra years in the workforce, so they have higher than entry-level salaries. This not only gives them more cash on hand but also lowers their debt-to-income ratio, making them much more attractive to lenders.\nThis season, more than any in recent years, agents are also sharing that potential buyers have become more flexible in their housing wish lists. Buyers are more willing to purchase a home that is in need of upgrades or one that isn’t in their first choice for a location. This greater flexibility is a large part of the reason closed sales are up 8 percent, compared with this time last year, even though active listings are down 14 percent year-to-date. Buyers have gotten the message that they need to broaden their criteria when it comes to owning a home.\nThe return of equity has helped considerably. Fourteen percent of our respondents listed this as the biggest reason they expect this year to be better than last. The rise in median sales prices has made current homeowners much more willing to sell their home, and that willingness is one of the main drivers behind the inventory that does make it on to the market. While it hasn’t been enough to meet demand, it has made the situation much better, compared with even three or four years ago.\nOf course, the price increases that are helpful to sellers can also create an obstacle for buyers, particularly the first-time or younger buyers in the region. But as I mentioned, these groups have several more years of saving under their belts that have made a larger percentage of them able to take on the greater costs. There are also many more mortgage products on the market that cater to these groups, either by requiring a lower percentage for the down payment or allowing greater flexibility when it comes to gifts from family members or student loan balances.\nThe final reason agents are optimistic about this year’s real estate market is the ongoing increase in rent prices around our region. That can often be the final push for buyers who don’t want to continue missing out on the possible equity they could gain from owning a home.\nWhen looking at the market as a whole, we are definitely in a seller’s market. However, this year has many more positive signs for buyers. The more stable job market and the improved financial position for so many people in our area are some of the biggest factors, but the increase in equity and broader array of mortgage options contribute, as well. Buyers have plenty of reasons to be optimistic this year, too.\nDavid Charron, chief strategy officer of Rockville-based multiple-listing service Bright MLS, writes an occasional column about the Washington-area real estate market."},{"url":"https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/05/the-people-left-behind-when-only-the-deserving-poor-get-help/528162","title":"The People Left Behind When Only the 'Deserving' Poor Get Help","author_text":"Annie Lowrey","keywords":[],"publication_text":"CityLab","description":"Maine attached work requirements and time limits to its safety net, intensifying poverty in the state.","date":"","full_text":"ORLAND, Maine—In the eyes of the state of Maine, Laurie Kane is an able-bodied adult without dependents, and thus ineligible for most forms of government support. In her own eyes, it is hard to see how she is going to find housing, work, and stability without help.\nKane is struggling to put her life back together amid a spell of homelessness that has lasted for three years. She has a severe anxiety condition, along with other health problems, and had suffered a panic attack on the day I met her. But she had not managed to sign up for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, because she cannot get a doctor to certify her as being disabled. That’s not because a doctor has evaluated her and found her to be fine, but because she’s been unable to get a doctor’s appointment. “I was denied MaineCare because I’m considered an able-bodied person,” she told me. “A lot of people say, ‘Well, you can just get free care.’ They say, ‘You can go to a clinic with a sliding-fee scale, which would be $20 a visit.’ But what if I can’t come up with $20?”\nShe was also struggling with the state’s newly instated requirement that recipients of food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, work for 20 hours a week or volunteer for 24 hours a month. She rarely leaves her room at the homeless shelter, she said, because it makes her so anxious. Even filling out the paperwork and sending it in to certify her shifts at a soup kitchen seemed like a lot. “I’m very worried about losing my food stamps,” she told me. With no cash income, no savings, no home, no health coverage, no car, and no treatment for her medical conditions, finding steady work seemed impossible. How would she get to a job in this depressed, rural part of the state? What about her panic attacks? If she lost her spot at the shelter, how would she get to her volunteer gig?\nKane is one of tens of thousands of Mainers affected by sweeping changes made to the state’s anti-poverty programs by the state’s Republican governor, Paul LePage. His administration has tightened eligibility for Medicaid, food stamps, and welfare, and hopes to do yet more: adding work requirements to Medicaid, removing young adults from public health coverage, and eliminating the state’s general-assistance funds for the indigent. The broad aim of these reforms is to create a safety net that provides help for the disabled, elderly, and children, but prompts able-bodied adults to help themselves. “It is this idea that all welfare should be workfare,” said Michael Hillard, an economist at the University of Southern Maine.\nIn implementing these changes, Maine has become a bellwether. A number of other states are copying the state’s reforms or devising similar ones of their own, with numerous states mulling attaching work, volunteering, and job-training requirements to safety-net programs. At the federal level, Speaker Paul Ryan has vowed to remake the safety net to emphasize employment, with the very first plank of his anti-poverty program to “expect work-capable adults to work or prepare for work in exchange for welfare benefits.”\nFor its part, the Trump administration, in its new budget proposal, suggests deep cuts to programs that help a range of vulnerable groups, including seniors, low-income children, single parents, the rural poor, and the disabled. It also has repeatedly emphasized the need to save taxpayer money and discourage what it thinks of as welfare dependency—including by extending work requirements to housing programs and increasing them for food stamps, among other initiatives. Ben Carson, the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, recently told The New York Times, “We have some people who are mentally ill. We have some elderly and disabled people ... [but] there is another group of people who are able-bodied individuals, and I think we do those people a great disservice when we simply maintain them.”\nIn an opinion piece released with the White House budget proposal, Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s budget director, went yet further. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we’re now looking at how we can respect both those who require assistance and the taxpayers who fund that support,” he wrote. “For the first time in a long time, we’re putting taxpayers first. Taking money from someone without an intention to pay it back is not debt. It is theft. This budget makes it clear that we will reverse this larceny.”\n“The value of work is about restoring self-confidence, self esteem, and human dignity. That matters not just for the parents, but for the future of their children.”\nThe point is to separate out the “deserving” from the “undeserving” poor, a concept that has its roots in Tudor England, when local parishes were instructed to punish and even execute the idle.\nWhere the federal government is now going, Maine has led the way. The state’s experience shows that policies that ask for more in exchange for aid—work requirements, time limits, asset tests, and so on—do slash social spending, and encourage some low-income adults to find a job or find a job more quickly. But they also leave many individuals and families in extreme poverty, without anywhere to turn.\n* * *\nPaul LePage, a crass and pugnacious Tea Party favorite, won Maine’s 2010 gubernatorial race by taking 38 percent of the vote in a five-way contest. His administration soon undertook dramatic safety-net reforms, with the twin aims of balancing the state budget and cutting back on aid for healthy adults. “Maine’s welfare program is cannibalizing the rest of state government,” the governor said at the 2012 Republican convention, to a standing ovation. “To all you able-bodied people out there: Get off the couch and get yourself a job.”\nThe issue has been not just principled, but personal, for the governor. One of eighteen children growing up in an impoverished and abusive family, LePage “left home at the age of eleven to escape domestic violence and lived on the streets of Lewiston for two years, making a meager living shining shoes,” an account of his early life written for the Conservative Political Action Conference reads. “At age 13, two families jointly ‘adopted’ Governor LePage. Eddy and Pauline Collins kept him busy washing dishes at the Theriault’s Cafe. Bruce and Joan Myrick kept him busy hauling boxes. Bruce was a Pepsi-Cola truck driver. Later the governor worked at the Antoine Rubber Company and at a meat packing company.”\nOthers should do has he did, LePage has argued: Deal with their hardships and find a way to rise. To that end, as every other state in New England accepted federal money to provide health coverage to low-income adults, Maine not only rejected the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, but tightened its eligibility standards, rescinding coverage for thousands and thousands of adults. It reinstated work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents receiving food stamps. It added an asset test to both its food stamp and welfare programs; the administration said the policy was meant to disqualify people who owned things like boats and jet skis, but having a second car or truck, a lot for wood harvesting, or a retirement-savings account counted too.\nThese reforms, along with a number of other changes, drastically reduced the amount of money the state spent on safety-net programs, as well as the number of people helped. Maine dropped health coverage for an estimated 14,500 parents and 10,000 childless adults, with Medicaid enrollment declining by more than 70,000 over time. The food-stamp program shrank by more than 20 percent. The number of able-bodied adults without dependents on food stamps plummeted by more than 80 percent. The welfare program halved in size.\nThe LePage administration—as well as a host of right-of-center think tanks, news outlets, and national-level politicians—declared the changes a success, arguing that they not only reduced costs for Maine’s taxpayers but resulted in higher rates of employment and even higher wages for the affected households.\n“We refused to define success by ever-increasing caseloads on welfare programs that have been trapping people in poverty,” Mary Mayhew, the director of Maine’s health and human-services department, told me. “We talk about the American Dream, but have designed welfare programs that have trapped people in a nightmare of poverty. Our focus was to not evaluate individuals through the lens of their poverty or their current circumstance, but through the lens of their potential, and to restructure these programs to be pathways out of poverty through employment.”\nThe LePage administration cites a bevy of statistics to make its case. An analysis of state wage data found that adults that did not or could not comply with the food-stamp work requirement saw their wages go up by 114 percent, with wages for those in compliance increasing by 20 percent. The Heritage Foundation hailed those results: “The federal government should establish a federal work requirement on [able-bodied adults without dependents] receiving food stamps that is similar to the one established in Maine. Such a nationwide policy could save the taxpayers $9.7 billion per year.”\nAs for Medicaid, Mayhew argued that the program was better targeted and more fiscally sustainable after LePage’s changes. “With the Medicaid program being awash in red ink, with massive shortfalls every single year, you’re not planning, you’re not managing,” she told me. “We have transformed that program to one that is stable, is able to prioritize its core mission, especially related to our elderly, our disabled, our most vulnerable population.”\nYet poverty experts question the sunny statistics put out by the LePage administration—and said that what happened after Maine’s reforms in the 2010s seems to be roughly akin to what happened after federal welfare reform in 1996. Back then, Bill Clinton and a bipartisan group of legislators attached strict work requirements and time limits to the cash-aid program, Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF). The poverty rate and the welfare rolls subsequently shrank. People found jobs.\nBut a strong economy and rising wages seem to have been the big factors in nudging people into the workforce, rather than the absence of benefits. Between the beginning of 1996 and the end of 1999, the national unemployment rate dropped from 5.6 to 4 percent, with wages and earnings growing across the income spectrum. In that climate, it became easier—and more attractive—to find work. It is true that the work requirements did encourage some people to get a job or get one faster, LaDonna Pavetti of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities told me. But they did not increase the overall level of employment in the medium or long term, spurring few individuals to get a job they were not already likely to get in time.\nThere were other consequences, and they fell hardest on those least able to deal with them. Many individuals unable or unwilling to work due to addiction issues, homelessness, health problems, domestic violence, or the simple trauma of living in extreme poverty, along with their children, ended up with no safety net at all. “Welfare reform got a group of more-able people into the labor market, but left behind families with more significant barriers,” Pavetti said.\nWith TANF’s federal funding stream frozen at its Clinton-era level of $16.5 billion, it has become less and less useful as a safety-net program over time. Reform is now in some important ways considered a failure, Pavetti added. “People assumed that what happened with TANF was all good, but that’s not really the true story,” she said, citing an increase in deep poverty, among other statistics. One 2010 examination of the data showed about 1.5 million households living on less than $2 per person per day.\nSimilarly, the LePage reforms came into effect after the worst of the Great Recession, as the state’s unemployment rate was declining to its current level of just 3 percent, one of the lowest in the nation. In other words, the administration might be taking credit for declines in the food-stamp and welfare rolls, as well as Medicaid enrollment, that would have happened anyway. On top of that, poverty experts said there is little evidence that the reforms have spurred people to work. That study of SNAP recipients that Mayhew cited, for instance, noted that less “than 60 percent of the non-complying group were found to have wage records in Maine,” implying that more than half of people dropped from food stamps for not maintaining a part-time job or volunteering had no wage income at all a year later.\nThat said, the changes do seem to have intensified poverty in the state. As Maine’s unemployment rate has dropped, its poverty rate has barely dropped. The share of Mainers experiencing food insecurity has remained elevated. The proportion of children living in deep poverty in the state has increased at eight times the national average—faster than in any other state—between 2011 and 2015.\nOther data paints a dire picture for the state’s most vulnerable families as well. A study by Sandy Butler of the University of Maine, for instance, looked at families hit by the LePage time limit on welfare benefits. It found that the median income of families that lost assistance was just $3,120 a year. Nearly one in three lost their homes after losing their welfare, and more than one in three said they had a work-limiting disability. Nearly 70 percent said they had visited a food bank, with one in three having a utility turned off. One in five got evicted or needed to go to a homeless shelter.\n“There’s this fallacy that these people are just lazy, or they don’t care, and that by taking help away, they will be empowered to move off of welfare into employment,” said Robyn Merrill, the executive director of Maine Equal Justice Partners, a nonprofit legal-aid provider. “But there are barriers. There are things that stand in the way, whether it’s affordable child care or transportation or needing more education or training. We aren’t doing anything about those things.”\n“They said, ‘You’re not going to get any services unless you’re actually homeless.’ And that Maine wouldn’t let a disabled little old lady stay in a shelter for long.”\nI spent a week traveling in Maine to meet people who had lost assistance, were at risk of losing assistance, or had been denied assistance due to the LePage reforms. One was Sandy J. Bishop, who was eating breakfast at the soup kitchen at Preble Street, a major state anti-poverty organization, in downtown Portland. At the time, Bishop was not receiving any kind of federal or state benefits, and had no cash income or savings. Deep poverty had become its own kind of trap, she explained. “Once you become homeless, then you lose everything,” she told me. “You can’t apply for a job. You can’t apply for an apartment. There are all these little glitches.”\nHer wallet had been stolen, so she lacked identification. She had a cell phone, but no money to put on it. She had needed to get her birth certificate replaced twice since becoming homeless. Every morning, she took all her belongings with her when she left the shelter, as there was no storage space for them there and clients cannot stay in the dorm rooms during the day. She piled her bags onto her walker and tossed her handbags over her shoulder, wrapping three scarves around her neck and carting her two canes. “I am not going to get hired like this,” she told me.\nThe LePage reforms had also disadvantaged low-income individuals and families in the vast reaches of rural Maine, social workers I spoke with explained, where there is scant public transportation and where there are fewer jobs and volunteering opportunities. Kane, for instance, had managed to get some work making wreaths during the holiday season and processing blueberries during the summer. But she worried she would not be able to do the same this year, since she had no way to get to the seasonal factories and the economy was slow. Kane’s case manager mentioned that another indigent client of hers lived on an island without a vehicle, and thus would never be able to meet a work or volunteering requirement.\nRelated Stories\nMore broadly, experts argue that work, volunteering, and job-training requirements overly burden individuals in areas with high rates of joblessness and failing economies, such as reservations and isolated rural areas.\nWork requirements also disadvantage people who have been incarcerated, given many businesses’ hesitation to hire ex-convicts and many nonprofits’ hesitation to take them on as volunteers—a particular problem in Maine given the state’s rampant opioid-abuse epidemic. (In Portland, the workers at Preble Street had trimmed the bottoms off of its bathroom doors, so that they could see if anyone had overdosed inside and administer naloxone.) Kane’s partner of nearly 20 years, Edmund Osbourne, had been arrested for selling opiate painkillers to a friend to try to raise some cash to pay a past-due bill and ended up serving a few months. “It ain’t been the same since that,” he said, describing his difficulty accessing both the safety net and the labor market.\nOther provisions in LePage’s effort to push people off the welfare rolls have proved confounding. Back in Portland, I went with a Preble Street worker to visit an elderly woman named Carolyn Silvius, who had become homeless after getting evicted by a landlord who accused her of smoking inside. (She said she had done no such thing.) She lived with her children for some time after that, but it became too burdensome for them. “We talked it over, the three of us,” Silvius told me. “They said, ‘You’re not going to get any services unless you’re actually homeless.’ And that Maine wouldn’t let a disabled little old lady stay in a shelter for long.”\nBut Maine did. In the ten months that she lived on a cot in a homeless shelter, Silvius searched for a new apartment and saved up her Supplemental Security Income money for a security deposit. But that inadvertently put her food stamps at risk, due to the state’s asset test. “The reviewer was like, ‘How much do you have in the bank?’ I told them the amount, because I had not moved in here yet,” she explained. “They said, ‘You have that kind of money? You’re not going to be able to get your full food stamps.’” They slashed the amount to just $60 a month, even though by the time the check arrived, Silvius didn’t have the money anymore—she was already in her new apartment.\nVeterans, too, have been hit hard by the new regime. James Gagne works to end homelessness among veterans for Preble Street. He said that he was often able to get veterans into supportive housing, but without food stamps or other forms income support, many quickly ended back up on the street. “Extreme poverty is a kind of trauma,” he told me. “In no other circumstance do we take traumatized people, slap them across the face, and say, ‘Help yourself! Get a job.’ We support people who are experiencing trauma.”\n* * *\nI asked Mayhew what she thought of the statistics showing that Maine’s poverty rate had failed to fall, and that the share of children growing up in extreme poverty in the state had increased. She questioned the reliability of the numbers, then said: “The notion that the answer to addressing poverty is to build out welfare programs absolutely misses the mark about what is going to be in the best long-term interest of those families and those children. We will never lose sight of our support for helping individuals achieve their potential.”\nI asked her what she thought of data showing that measures of hunger had remained level, if not increased, as the unemployment rate dropped in Maine: “These are surveys, and more often than not with these surveys, they tend to change or tweak their methodology, which often makes it difficult to compare year over year.”\nMore broadly, I asked her what the state owed children whose mothers and fathers could not comply with the state’s work requirements and other provisions, who would slip into extreme poverty without state support. Does there need to be a safety net for them? “That’s not what the program’s for, though,” Mayhew told me, speaking about TANF. “The value of work is about restoring self-confidence, self esteem, and human dignity. That matters not just for the parents, but for the future of their children.”\nIn many ways, her answers stressed a deeper truth about the safety net during a time of political polarization. Republicans tend to focus intently on individual responsibility and separating out “deserving” from the “undeserving” poor. Democrats tend to focus on universal programs and changing the social and economic structures that perpetuate poverty. Both ultimately stress that a job is the best way out of poverty. Yet neither has managed to make the labor market work for people at its very bottom.\nGiven that the labor market fails so many families, as Maine demonstrates, it is very hard to cure poverty by requiring people to work—and all sorts of harm ensues for fragile individuals and children when welfare dollars disappear. If implemented at a national level, poverty experts said, such provisions will inevitably end up impoverishing some of society’s most vulnerable, like veterans, single parents, addicts, infants, victims of domestic violence, those with chronic health problems, and the formerly incarcerated. On top of that, they would do little to increase net employment among the poor.\nI asked Jan Bindas-Tenney, Preble Street’s advocacy coordinator, what would happen to the organization if a major cut, like the block-granting of Medicaid or food stamps—which Paul Ryan has proposed—came through.\n“We couldn’t keep up with need,” she said. “We already can’t.”\nThis post originally appeared on The Atlantic."},{"url":"https://theconversation.com/iraq-and-afghanistan-the-us-6-trillion-bill-for-americas-longest-war-is-unpaid-78241","title":"Iraq and Afghanistan: The US$6 trillion bill for America's longest war is unpaid","author_text":"Linda J.

That's not the case for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the costs are adding up fast.","date":"","full_text":"On Memorial Day, we pay respects to the fallen from past wars – including the more than one million American soldiers killed in the Civil War, World Wars I and II, Korea and Vietnam.\nYet the nation’s longest and most expensive war is the one that is still going on. In addition to nearly 7,000 troops killed, the 16-year conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan will cost an estimated US$6 trillion due to its prolonged length, rapidly increasing veterans health care and disability costs and interest on war borrowing. On this Memorial Day, we should begin to confront the staggering cost and the challenge of paying for this war.\nThe enormous figure reflects not just the cost of fighting – like guns, trucks and fuel – but also the long-term cost of providing medical care and disability compensation for decades beyond the end of the conflict. Consider the fact that benefits for World War I veterans didn’t peak until 1969. For World War II veterans, the peak came in 1986. Payments for Vietnam-era vets are still climbing.\nThe high rates of injuries and increased survival rates in Iraq and Afghanistan mean that over half the 2.5 million who served there suffered some degree of disability. Their health care and disability benefits alone will easily cost $1 trillion in coming decades.\nBut instead of facing up to these huge costs, we have charged them to the national credit card. This means that our children will be forced to pay the bill for the wars started by our generation. Unless we set aside money today, it is likely that young people now fighting in Afghanistan will be shortchanged in the future just when they most need medical care and benefits.\nA forgotten war\nWhile most Americans are keen to “support our troops,” we aren’t currently shouldering the financial or the physical burden of our nation’s warfare. Except for a short period between the two world wars, the percentage of the general population now serving in the U.S. armed forces is at its lowest level ever.\nWhat’s more, the war in Afghanistan barely features on our front pages. During the past two years it has not even made it into the top 10 news stories.\nThere is not much pain in our pocketbooks either. In past wars, taxpayers were forced to cover some of the extra spending. During Vietnam, marginal tax rates for the top 1 percent of earners were hiked to 77 percent. President Harry Truman raised tax rates as high as 92 percent during the Korean War, telling the country that “this is a contribution to our national security that every one of us should stand ready to make.” In fact, taxes were raised during every American conflict since the Revolutionary War, especially for the wealthy.\nThis time around we have borrowed the money instead. Thanks to the Bush-era tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, nearly all Americans now pay lower taxes than before the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. And unlike previous wars, Congress has paid for the post 9/11 conflicts using so-called “emergency” and “overseas contingency operations” spending bills, which bypass Congress’ own budget caps. This has allowed the government to avoid any uncomfortable national discussion on how to balance war spending against other domestic priorities.\nA bipartisan effort\nWe cannot simply undo the trillions of dollars that have already been added to the national debt as a result of these wars, but there is an important step we can take to commemorate those who have given their lives or their health to this 16-year-long quagmire. We owe it to them to ensure that there is sufficient money set aside to pay for the benefits we have promised to them and their families.\nThe solution is to set up a Veterans Trust Fund. Trust funds are an established mechanism for the federal government to fund long-term commitments. We already have more than 200 of them, including the best-known, Social Security. While trust funds do not force the government to set aside money, the federal government would be required to prepare an accounting of how much money is owed to veterans’ and take steps to provide funding to pay claims as they come due.\nThis process has already been adopted for the Military Retirement Trust Fund, which pays pensions to career service members who retire after 20 years’ service. Since Congress established the fund in 1984, it has been amortizing the retirement benefits that are already due and transferring an annual amount into the fund to cover them. We need to adopt a similar approach for today’s all-volunteer veterans – who fight multiple, lengthy tours of duty but usually leave the military before 20 years are up.\nFour members of Congress, Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), Seth Moulton (D-MA), Don Young (R-AK) and Walter Jones (R-NC), recently introduced a bipartisan Veterans Health Care Trust Fund Act. This proposal would establish a fund for veterans’ benefits, paid for in part by a small income tax surcharge. Those serving in the military and their families would be exempt from paying.\nSuch a fund cannot solve all the problems of today’s veterans. But on this Memorial Day, let’s not forget to provide for the men and women who have borne the brunt of the nation’s longest and most expensive war."},{"url":"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/detroit-mural-artists-charles-mcgee","title":"Work Begins on Massive Detroit Mural by 92-Year-Old Artist","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Charles McGee's largest work to date.","date":"","full_text":"In Detroit, work began last week on a massive mural designed by 92-year-old legend Charles McGee.\nTitled “Unity,” it will cover a 118-by-50-foot space on the side of the 28 Grand at 28 Grand River Avenue, the Detroit Free Press reports. Though McGee was responsible for a number of iconic murals throughout the 1970s, this will be his largest to date.\nThe Free Press reports:\nOnce finished, it will be a sweeping vision in black and white — a mix of polka dots, curved lines and various geometric shapes that harken to the artist’s earlier work in downtown Detroit, but without the same simplicity or vivid colors. The various abstract shapes and elements might not appear cohesive at first glance. This speaks to a larger message within the finished piece that McGee hopes translates: demonstrating community and togetherness through seemingly distinct and different shapes.\nThe skyline-worthy piece is funded by a public arts partnership between Bedrock, a real estate company owned by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert, and Library Street Collective, an art gallery. 28 Grand will be a building of micro-apartments, about 260 square feet, and there are units set aside as affordable rentals.\nA Library Street Collective exhibition of McGee’s work, called “Still Searching,” will open June 1. It “traces McGee’s 70-year-long career through an array of works that encapsulate two of the artist’s most enduring themes: chronicles of the black experience and a love of nature,” according to a press release.\nThe Free Press emphasizes McGee’s decades of influence on the Detroit arts scene through advocacy, teaching, curation and his own creations, noting that murals he did “would be dubbed ‘street art’ today, but actually pre-dated the popularization of the phrase by a decade.” Several murals by McGee and his contemporaries are fading or have been removed or covered with advertisements, according to the paper. But one of the founding partners of Library Street Collective, Anthony Curis, envisions a project that would also restore those historic works.\n“These murals have been ghosted, neglected or destroyed over the years,” he told the paper. “We’re interested in working with the artists and the estates of those artists to actually re-create or repaint those murals.”\nThe paper also emphasizes that while McGee may be 92, he’s not exactly slowing down.\n“I’m getting older and the work is getting more expressive,” he told the Free Press. “Every time I pick up an instrument to make a mark, the hunger, the dedication, the observation for me is still the same.”\nRachel Dovey is an award-winning freelance writer and former USC Annenberg fellow living at the northern tip of California’s Bay Area.

But now, all parties involved, including the judge, have entered into a new agreement.\nThe new version states that discordant policies like the restraints are no longer standard practice, and Henley-Young can only detain a maximum of 32 children and none of those for more than 21 days without alternative plans.\n'Must Be Handcuffed'\nUntil this agreement, Judge Skinner was adamantly in favor of restraints of the children, regardless of their offense. \"All youths detained at the Henley Young Juvenile Justice Center held for court appearance(s) before this Court must be handcuffed while being held in the holding tank and prior to entry to the courtroom for their respective court appearance,\" Skinner's detention guidelines standing order from April 15, 2014, stated (emphasis judge's own).\nThe order, included in a June 22, 2016, motion to hold the judge in contempt of the federal consent decree, stated that the policy was in place to \"ensure that the court is not to be delayed.\"\nThe consent decree, updated and reaffirmed by all the parties involved earlier this year except for the youth-court judge, states that \"mechanical restraints shall not be used to punish youth or for the convenience of the staff.\"\nUntil April, the youth-court judge was not even a member of the lawsuit, which caused friction between the limits placed on Henley-Young's administrators and the ability of the judge to rule as he saw fit. In their motion to intervene in the lawsuit in April, Skinner's attorney states that \"the existing parties to the litigation do not adequately protect the Hinds County Youth Court's interests.\"\nSkinner did not respond to attempts to contact him by phone or email.\nAfter months of talks, all the parties involved reached a compromise in the new Memorandum of Understanding finalized June 27.\n\"There is a youth-court judge and a youth court that happens to be housed in the same building as a detention center, but those are separate operations,\" Hinds County Board of Supervisors attorney Pieter Teeuwissen said during a phone interview on Aug. 10. \"Now, ideally, those operations would complement each other.\"\nJoi Owens, an attorney with Disability Rights Mississippi, is also hopeful. \"Everyone is on the same page, and I think that's one of the reasons we wanted to be really specific because this is now going on for several years, and we are finally in a place where we have an administration in place that is working with all parties,\" Owens said during an Aug. 2 interview.\n\"The goal was for all of us to come together, to get on the same page, so hopefully we can get Henley-Young to where we need to be to provide the appropriate services for the kids there,\" Owens said.\n'So Far, So Good'\nHenley-Young Executive Director Johnnie McDaniels said that with Judge Skinner's cooperation, the facility can now work with the youth court to follow the policies outlined in the consent decree. That includes keeping the maximum population for the facility at 32 children and holding none of the young people past the 21-day limit without transfer plans, as Skinner often did.\n\"Whenever you put new kinds of directions in place, you have to make sure that everybody is interpreting it the same way,\" McDaniels said. \"The judge (Skinner) has been receptive. We have involved the federal monitor when he and I weren't totally on the same page, just to kind of have a neutral referee to say this is what this means. So far, so good.\"\nMcDaniels said the detention center communicates with the youth court to coordinate a treatment plan for the children who have to spend more than 21 days in confinement, usually organizing an arrangement for transfer to another facility.\n\"If they know that they are going to sentence a kid for more than 21 days ... that triggers us to know that after 21 days part of the agreement requires the county to look at other places to place that child so that they can get the services that they need,\" McDaniels said.\nHe added that if the child cannot be placed until \"a reasonable time\" after the 21-day limit, then the juvenile might remain a few days later than the limit.\n\"That way we don't have a kid sitting back there wondering what is going to happen to them,\" McDaniels said.\nThe MOU also limits to 32 the number children that can be detained in Henley-Young.\nMcDaniels said that the number detained depends on the funding and that the limit was based on an affordable ratio of staff to children based on the current budget, which he said had increased over last year.\n\"Based on our staffing levels, we can properly care for 32 children,\" McDaniels said. \"For the last month or so the numbers have been down. When I say down I say about maybe 15, we have had even less than that.\"\n\"In my discussions with the federal monitor I said we are going to remain staffed and ready for 32,\" McDaniels said, \"because you never know when you are going to be hit with that number here.\"\n\"I think the county understands that it has to be done,\" McDaniels said, adding that may not always have been the case.\nEmail city reporter Tim Summers Jr. at tim@jacksonfreepress.com.

And some privacy advocates and technology experts want Congress to make the agency rein in the practice.\nHere’s POLITICO’s summary of where that debate stands:\nHow did hackers get ahold of the NSA’s tools?\nThat’s a good question. But the ransomware racing around the globe is based on a cache of apparent NSA hacking software and documents that a group calling itself “the Shadow Brokers” posted online on April 14. (Shadow Brokers first began making these kinds of dumps last year.) The Trump and former Obama administrations have refused to confirm that the NSA had lost control of its tools, but former intelligence officials say the leaked material is genuine.\nHow the hacking tools escaped the NSA is unknown. But there are three main possibilities: An NSA employee or contractor went rogue and stole the files; a sophisticated adversary such as the Russian government hacked into the spy agency and took them; or an NSA hacker accidentally left the files exposed on a server being used to stage a U.S. intelligence operation, and someone found them.\nContractors, who can lack the institutional loyalty of regular employees, have long been a source of heartache to the intelligence community, from the 2013 Snowden leaks to the arrest last year of Harold Martin, a Maryland man charged with stealing reams of classified files and hoarding them in his home.\nWhich NSA tool are the hackers using?\nIt appears to be a modified version of an NSA hacking tool, a software package dubbed “ETERNALBLUE,” that was buried in the Shadow Brokers’ leak.\nThe tool took advantage of a flaw in a part of Windows called the Server Message Block, or SMB, protocol, which connects computers on a shared network. In essence, the flaw allows malware to spread across networks of unpatched Windows computers, a dangerous prospect in the increasingly connected world.\nAfter the cache leaked, cybersecurity researchers, realizing that the SMB vulnerability could expose organizations to massive hacks, “reverse engineered” the tool, checking how it worked and evaluating how to defeat it. These researchers posted their work online to crowdsource and accelerate the process.\nBut their work also helped digital thieves. At some point, the criminals behind the ransomware attack grabbed the reverse-engineered exploit and incorporated it into their malware.\nThis separated their attack tool from previous popular iterations of ransomware. Whereas normal ransomware locks down an infected computer’s files and stops there, this variant can jump from machine to machine, infecting entire businesses like the internet’s earliest computer worms.\nWhat did the NSA do after learning of the theft?\nThe spy agency probably warned Microsoft about the vulnerability soon afterward. Microsoft released a patch for computer users to repair the flaw in March, a month before the Shadow Brokers leak.\nBut that’s not good enough for civil liberties advocates, who want stricter limits on how long the government can hold onto vulnerabilities it discovers.\n“These attacks underscore the fact that vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and criminals around the world,” said Patrick Toomey, a national security attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, in a statement. “Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone’s digital life safer.”\nThe agency’s defenders disagree. “That nobody else discovered these vulnerabilities as far as we know suggests that it is right for the NSA to hold onto them if they have confidence that nobody else has a copy of their tools,” Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the University of California in Berkeley, told POLITICO. “It actually is a problem that the NSA can’t or won’t claim credit for properly notifying Microsoft. The NSA did the right thing, and they aren’t getting the credit for it they deserve.”\nIs this a new controversy for the NSA?\nNo. But the crisis that began on Friday is giving it prominence like never before.\nPrivacy advocates and tech companies have long criticized the U.S. spy agencies for keeping knowledge of security flaws a secret and building hacking tools to exploit them. And they say it’s especially bad when the government can’t keep its secret exploits out of the hands of cyber criminals.\n“When [a] U.S. nuclear weapon is stolen, it’s called an ‘empty quiver,’” tweeted Snowden, whose 2013 leaks exposed the vast underbelly of the government's spying capacity. “This weekend, [the NSA’s] tools attacked hospitals.”\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith also denounced the NSA’s inability to secure its tools. “An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen,” he wrote in a weekend blog post.\nPutin later picked up that theme, telling reporters in Beijing that U.S. intelligence agencies were clearly “the initial source of the virus.”\n“Once they're let out of the lamp, genies of this kind, especially those created by intelligence services, can later do damage to their authors and creators,\" the Russian leader said.\nBut former national security officials say the government needs to build hacking tools to keep the U.S. safe. And White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert downplayed the possible origin of the code Monday.\n“Regardless of the provenance of the exploit here used,” he told ABC, “who is culpable are the criminals that distributed it and the criminals that weaponized it, added additional details to it, and turned this into something that is holding ransom data but also putting at risk lives and hospitals.”\nWhat’s Congress doing?\nThe government uses a system called the “Vulnerability Equities Process” to determine whether and when agencies must tell companies about code flaws they discover. Following recent spy agency leaks, former government officials, cyber experts and tech companies have proposed changes to the VEP that would limit the intelligence community’s ability to hoard vulnerabilities.\nSome are calling for Congress to act.\nThose include Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat with a computer science degree, who has led the charge to reform the VEP.\nLieu, a leading congressional voice on cybersecurity, called the process “not transparent” in a statement Friday, saying “few people understand how the government makes these critical decisions.” The ransomware campaign, he added, “shows what can happen when the NSA or CIA write malware instead of disclosing the vulnerability to the software manufacturer.”\nBut Lieu’s bill is unlikely to become law. Not only does the intelligence community have numerous defenders in Congress, but politicians simply aren’t paying much attention to the issue. Lawmakers haven't rushed to join Lieu in calling for VEP changes. There have only been a few hearings on ransomware in recent years, and no pending legislation mentions either ransomware or the VEP.\nMartin Matishak contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-innovative-financing-methods-driving-better-health-care-for-all-90083","title":"Opinion: Innovative financing methods driving better health care for all","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Devex","description":"Universal health coverage was adopted as one of the targets under Sustainable Development Goal 3, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

UHC includes access to quality, essential health care services, and to safe, effective and affordable medicines and vaccines, as well as protection against financial risk.\nBut in the drive to improve people’s lives and to extend access to care, how can we best ensure that progress towards UHC — and a sustainable and inclusive model of health care — is structural, not merely incidental or sporadic?\n\"Accelerating the growing international movement for universal health coverage will be my number-one priority.\"\n— Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization\nStrengthening primary health care, with outreach into the community and a well-functioning referral chain, is the most efficient and effective way to improve access to good-quality health care, thereby paving the way for UHC.\nHowever, this requires a number of significant changes. First, primary health care systems need to be redesigned, based on community needs, to include services ranging from prevention to emergency care. This would ensure the systems are fit-for-purpose in tackling today’s and tomorrow’s disease burden, especially with the rise of noncommunicable diseases. Secondly, health care systems need to harness the full potential of technology, in particular digital technology, to improve the quality and efficiency of care.\nAt the same time, hybrid public-private health care models or other forms of partnership with the private sector should be considered. Governments need to decide on their role in delivering primary health care. Some governments may decide to let market actors provide care and take on a stewardship role, paying for results — either directly or through a public health insurance system — and assuring care providers meet national quality standards. Others may maintain strong ownership of service delivery, but will need to partner with the private sector to transform primary care through the effective application of innovations.\nResults-based financing\nIn pursuit of the SDGs, financing schemes need to change from input-based to results-based in order to provide incentives to improve health outcomes and efficiency of service delivery. There are several types of results-based financing models:\n1. Output-based models, where payment is linked to the volume of services provided.\nThe key to this transformation — and to the realization of the health care-related SDGs — is the pressing need for innovative financing and business models. For example, public-private partnerships that combine government funding with private income flows could facilitate new, sustainable business models that drive better health care for all.\nHybrid financing: The way ahead for health care\nThe way things are just now, something has to change. At present, donor funding alone is not sufficient to achieve the SDGs, especially with Western countries reducing their development cooperation budgets. Private investors, in particular impact investors, are interested in closing this funding gap, provided they can combine impact with financial return on investment. They are hesitant to invest in projects that are solely dependent on government payments, due to the poor track record of governments in target countries — e.g. developing economies — in meeting their long-term payment obligations.\nWe believe that a new, hybrid business model bringing together donors and impact investors, governments and the private sector has the potential to deliver on the SDGs. Certainly, private companies are willing to invest in innovations towards the SDGs, providing that reasonable returns can be achieved.\nAn example of a hybrid model would be where basic services paid for by government are combined with additional services paid for by patients, preferably through health insurance. Such hybrid business models can be deployed in PPPs, where the management capabilities, efficiency and innovation power of the private sector are applied to improve government service delivery.\nPartnering for the long term\nWith our mission to improve people’s lives through meaningful innovation, at Philips we are committed to long-term partnerships with governments and other stakeholders to strengthen their (primary) health care systems. As a promoter of the World Economic Forum Primary Healthcare Coalition and the Kenya SDG Partnership Platform, we are investing in technology and business model innovation in support of UHC.\nFor example, through our Community Life Centers — an open platform aimed at strengthening primary health care and turning the local health facility into a community hub, where technology is bundled with an integrated service package. The success of the first pilots in Kenya and Democratic Republic of the Congo gives us confidence that such platforms, implemented in collaboration with governmental and civil society partners, can be replicated at scale and so improve access to quality care for all.\nAnother essential change is that donors should allow the private sector to compete for their funding based on maximum impact per dollar spent. Currently, most donors allow private companies to participate in competitive bidding processes, but often do not allow profit-making, and sometimes even require a financial contribution, thus rendering the contract loss-making. These types of models are not sufficiently scalable.\nA commitment to long-term partnerships with governments and other stakeholders is vital in order to strengthen health care systems. It is by working together — and pursuing financing models where results on health care and service delivery are defined at population level — that we can scale the impact on people’s lives.\nWhat kinds of innovative financing models do you believe are most likely to help in the pursuit of the SDGs? Have your say by leaving a comment below.\nOver 10 weeks Devex, along with our partners the European Investment Bank, the International Finance Corporation, Philips, and the United Nations Development Programme, will take an in-depth look at the innovative financing mechanisms driving forward the 2030 sustainable development agenda.

But don’t let that good news distract from the Trump budget’s deeply damaging proposals that target higher education and student aid — including raiding the Pell surplus.\nRelated: What good is new summer Pell money if students can’t use it?\nRepurposing a surplus may not sound like the most outrageous or damaging proposal in President Donald Trump’s budget. But it’s a slap in the face to millions of students who made sacrifices to build up that safety net. After all, the current $10.6 billion surplus did not appear out of thin air. It was paid for by students, for the sake of students. And any amount that gets taken from the surplus today increases the odds of deeper cuts tomorrow.\nUnderstanding how hard-fought the Pell surplus is requires a look at the program’s recent history.\nFor years, Pell — which next year will offer up to $5,920 a year per qualifying student — had been in a fairly steady state of size and funding. But the financial crisis beginning in 2007 meant that more people — traditional-aged students as well as adults — couldn’t get jobs, so education became the answer to their predicament.\nAt the same time, many families were worse off financially, so more students qualified for the Pell. Congress also made the Pell award more generous through three infusions of funding in 2007, 2009, and 2010.\nAs a result of these changes, the number of Pell recipients skyrocketed from 5.5 million for the 2007-2008 school year to 9.3 million just three years later. The cost of the program ballooned by billions of dollars.\nTo grapple with this funding crisis, Congress first cut $2.1 billion a year in costs by eliminating the year-round Pell eligibility that had been established only a few years earlier. That means that students taking summer classes to finish school more quickly couldn’t get a Pell Grant to pay for those extra summer credits.\nNext, Congress eliminated a subsidized loan option for graduate students with financial need, which means that those grad students are racking up interest even while they are in school, and typically not earning a salary that would help them make payments. That cut was estimated to save $18 billion over 10 years.\nRelated: Just as it wants students to speed up, government won’t pay for summer courses\nFinally, the 2012 budget trimmed back Pell eligibility even further, to save another $11 billion over 10 years.\nIt reduced the number of semesters for which a student can receive Pell from 18 to 12, made it harder to automatically qualify for the maximum award, and eliminated the ability of students without a high school diploma or its equivalent to get access to federal aid.\nMost of these cuts remain in place. However, the financial aid for students without a diploma was restored in a more limited form. And just this month, Congress restored year-round Pell as part of the agreement to fund the government through September.\nThe 2012 budget cuts alone were estimated to make at least 100,000 Pell recipients ineligible. These cuts and others had bipartisan support because they got the Pell program back on sound footing, with help from the improving economy as well.\nRelated: An unprecedented look at Pell Grant graduation rates from 1,149 schools\nBut the cuts also meant that real students had to take on more debt — and in some cases, give up on their college education.\nThe Pell Grant surplus was built by students, but now the Trump administration wants to strip it away from them. And for what? We don’t know exactly, but we do know it’s not for education priorities. Trump’s budget proposal seeks to slash a total of over $9 billion — nearly 14 percent — from the Department of Education budget.\nRelated: FROM THE ARCHIVES: Trump budget doesn’t cover Pell Grants to be used for college summer courses\nIt shrinks or eliminates crucial programs for low-income college students, and doesn’t offer any inflation increase for the maximum Pell award.\nSo, it stands to reason that the administration is seeking to drain the Pell surplus in favor of some other agenda – perhaps defense spending or the border wall. Not only would this rob students of yesterday, but it also puts future enrollment at risk.\nThe smaller the Pell cushion, the greater the odds the program will run a shortfall the next time a recession hits and enrollment spikes again. And you can bet that Congress won’t acknowledge the past raids on the surplus and restore funding. Instead, we’ll get another round of press releases about cuts to make the program “sustainable.”\nThat’s not right. Students already paid once for the Pell Grant surplus.

Rubiera/The Fayetteville Observer]\nStaff writer\n@RodgerMullen\n‘The Diary of Anne Frank’ continues at Gilbert Theater through June 4\nThe story of Anne Frank has been told so many times, in so many formats, that it almost risks over-familiarity.\nThe Gilbert Theater’s production of “The Diary of Anne Frank” thankfully sidesteps that potential pitfall and delivers a moving and involving take on the tragic tale.\nThe play, directed by Brian Adam Kline and starring Rebekah Brunson as Anne and Michael Carney and Rhonda Brocki as her parents, opened Friday and continues through Sunday.\nBased on the diaries that survived after World War II and Anne’s death in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, the play takes place entirely in the rooms in Amsterdam where the Frank family and some friends hid from the Nazis.\nWhere: Gilbert Theater, 116 Green St.\nWhen: Through Sunday, with performances today and Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.\nTickets: $16; $14 for the military, seniors 55 and up, students and first responders\nInformation: 678-7186 or gilberttheater.com\nNerves become frayed and bonds are forged between the crammed-in occupants of the hiding place. In particular, Anne forms a budding romance with Peter Van Daan (Michael Butsch), a boy a little older than she who is also hiding with his family.\nAll too soon comes the inevitable end, but not before we get to know the characters in varying degrees.\nAnne is bright, inquisitive and more than a little stubborn, particularly in her interactions with her long-suffering mother. Rebekah, who is 17, did a fine job of bringing the doomed character to life on opening night Friday.\nAnother stand-out is Carney as Otto Frank. Portraying the only member of the Frank family to survive the Holocaust and the keeper of Anne’s diary and her memory, Carney accurately conveyed the incredible burden the father had to have carried.\nI also liked James Dean as Mr. Dussel, a curmudgeonly late-comer to the hiding place. Dean brought energy to the role, and his clashes with Anne provided islands of humor in the play.\nThe Gilbert’s stage is not big enough to show all the ins and outs of the actual Anne Frank house — all the rooms are basically consolidated into one. However, that actually works to the play’s advantage, as it emphasizes the claustrophobia of the surroundings.\nIn an effort to modernize the play, Kline opened and closed it with somewhat contemporary songs — Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day” at the beginning and David Bowie’s “Heroes” at the end.\nThat worked fine. Less successful, however, were the “readers” who appeared periodically to recite passages from Anne’s diary. It seemed superfluous; the action on the stage was more than enough to convey the story.\n“The Diary of Anne Frank” is the Gilbert’s last play of the 2016-17 season and performances continue only through Sunday. It’s well worth seeing for its depiction of a time that should never be repeated, or forgotten.\nStaff writer Rodger Mullen can be reached at rmullen@fayobserver.com or 486-3561."},{"url":"http://www.caller.com/story/news/local/texas/state-bureau/2017/06/06/speculation-rises-abbott-call-special-session/102544070","title":"Abbott sets special legislative session for July 18","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Corpus Christi Caller-Times","description":"The governor says first order of business will be to extend the life of the Texas Medical Board, then he'll add a scaled-back bathroom bill, a property tax overhaul and other items for lawmakers to tackle.","date":"","full_text":"The governor says first order of business is to extend the life of the Texas Medical Board, then he'll add a scaled-back bathroom bill, a property tax overhaul and other items for lawmakers to tackle.\nAUSTIN – Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday he's calling lawmakers back to Austin next month to tackle a wide range of topics that fell through the cracks during the recently ended legislative session, including what will likely be a scaled-back version of the \"bathroom bill,\" but first they must pass a measure to keep in business the agency that oversees Texas doctors.\nSpeaking to reporters but taking no questions, the first-term governor said the only reason he's putting the Legislature back to work for 30 days starting July 18 is because of a stalemate between the the House and Senate that derailed numerous pieces of legislation during the waning days of the regular session.\n\"A special session was entirely avoidable, and there was plenty of time for the legislature to forge compromises to avoid the time and taxpayer expense of a special session. As governor, if I am going to call a special session, I intend to make it count.\"\nHe then laid out an ambitious agenda for lawmakers to tackle once they dispense with the routine measure to extend the life of the Texas Medical Board. The bill to keep the agency alive became something of pawn in the battle of wills between Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who runs the Texas Senate, and House Speaker Joe Straus over the high-profile effort to limit the restroom choices of transgender people.\nAbbott did include what he called \"privacy\" legislation on the special session to-do list, but he specifically mentioned the comparatively modest bill backed by Straus and most House members that mainly focused on public schools and not the more far-reaching measure backed by Patrick and Senate Republicans.\nBut Abbott did say the House version was the \"minimum\" lawmakers should do on the matter.\nPatrick, who as both he and Straus openly sparred over the bathroom bill in the sessions final two weeks, praised Abbott for his \"big and bold\" a special session agenda but he did not address the bathroom bill, which was the issue that prevented the House and Senate from completing their work before the session ended May 29.\n\"The people of Texas have a right to expect that we will finish the job on these critical issues and I am happy to join with the governor in doing the work they elected us to do,\" Patrick said in a statement.\nMeanwhile, the influential Texas Association of Business, which vigorously opposed Patrick's efforts to regulate restroom, appeared to have little use for the version that Abbott said lawmakers should pursue over the summer.\n\"Many of the issues Governor Abbott has listed for the special session will have a positive impact to the state,\" said TAB President Chris Wallace. \"However, TAB is on record opposing discriminatory language such as H.B. 2899,\" the version of the bathroom bill that passed the House.\nMany of the items that Abbott laid at lawmakers' feet will likely deepen the partisan divide in the Legislature solidly controlled by Republicans. He called for additional measures surely to aggravate Democrats, including further restrictions on access to abortion services, a pilot program for school vouchers that could be used by parents of special-needs children and prohibiting the use of tax dollars to pay for union-dues collections.\nHe also called for boosting teachers' pay by $1,000 a year, but did not spell out how to pay for that pay raise, but he did call for establishing a commission to examine how to overhaul the school finance system. He also wants lawmakers to limit the rate of increase in local property taxes.\nAbbott's proposal to preempt local governments from imposing what he called \"a patchwork of regulations\" on matters such as when property owners can cut down trees or how often policies governing construction can be changed.\nThe Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal think-tank in Austin,praised Abbott for calling for higher pay for teachers, but said his efforts to rein in local governments' authority is short-sighted.\n\"Limiting the ability of local governments to raise revenue to pay police officers, firefighters and other first responders was wrong during the regular session and is wrong during a special session,\" said Ann Beeson, the group's executive director."},{"url":"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/idps-attention-refugees-idmc-170530110506840.html","title":"IDPs need as much attention as refugees, says IDMC","author_text":"","keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"A monitoring group says more than 40 million IDPs are waiting for the world to take notice of their plight.","date":"","full_text":"More than 31 million people were internally displaced due to conflict and disasters in 2016, but the issue has been overshadowed by the focus on refugees and migrants, according to a report by a monitoring group.\nThe Global Report on Internal Displacement by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) found that on average, one person was forced to flee every second in 2016, a trend it called a \"horrific\" new level of displacement.\nDisasters displaced three times more people than conflicts, with most of the 24 million people affected by sudden-onset weather hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and severe winter conditions.\nIn total, 31.1 million new cases of internal displacements were reported in 125 countries last year.\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with 922,000 new displacements in 2016, topped the list of countries where this displacement was driven by conflict while 7,434,000 people in China were forced to flee their homes due to natural disasters.\nThe UN refugee agency UNHCR put the number of refugees in 2015 at 21.3 million with 53 percent of those coming from Somalia, Afghanistan and Syria.\nBut despite the increasing numbers of the internally displaced people (IDPs), their plight was being overshadowed and becoming difficult to place on the international agenda, according to the IDMC.\n\"Absolutely, that's one of our main regrets [IDP issue being overlooked],\" Alexandra Bilak, IDMC director, told Al Jazeera.\n\"Internal displacement is a politically sensitive issue.

Almost 19,000 UN troops are currently protecting Congolese people from violence in Congo amid calls by the United States to reduce that number despite increasing attacks and instability.\n\"That DRC figure really took us all a bit by surprise. Over the last four to five years, it was usually the Middle East that was consistently high on the list and DRC had fallen off the agenda,\" said Bilak.\n\"It's unrealistic to expect the international community to solve a problem as huge as the DRC alone. It's a protracted crisis. There is very little humanitarian assistance on the ground in some parts.\"\nThe Syrian refugee crisis remains one of the largest humanitarian crises since the end of World War II.\nThe number of refugees who have fled the country now exceeds five million, including more than 2.4 million children, and millions more have been displaced internally, according to the UN.\nAt least 23,544 civilians were displaced between May 18 and 22, 2016, added the UN.\n\"People say displacement is a domestic issue and should be resolved at a domestic level. Many see it as an encroachment at national sovereignty. Internal displacement requires its own set of principles and the approach is very different from the refugee and migrant issue.\"\nAdditionally, many refugees returning to their home country fear the risk of being internally displaced once they return. Large-scale returns were mirrored by a considerable increase in the number of IDPs in 46 percent of cases between 2000 and 2016, according to the World Bank.\nWATCH: Syria - Displaced families in Idlib face harsh Ramadan (2:32)\nThe IDMC presented the case of around 600,000 Afghans returning from Pakistan. UNHCR estimates that around half of them were unable to return to their place of origin.\nDestructive floods and landslides in northern China killed at least 154 people and accounted for the majority of those displaced.\nTyphoons, floods and landslides were the major causes of displacement in Philippines (5.9 million), India (2.4 million) and Indonesia (1.2 million) last year.\nJan Egeland, the head of the NRC, said the shocking figures show the need to focus as much on people displaced inside their countries than on refugees who flee across borders.\n\"Internally displaced people now outnumber refugees by two to one. It is urgent to put internal displacement back on the global agenda,\" said Egeland.\nA number of the IDPs, in search of improved conditions then cross over into a different country, said the IDMC. As a result, \"today's IDPs could become tomorrow's refugees\".\n\"We know there's an overlap but there is not enough data to be able to put a number to that phenomenon.

But Apollo 11 was a NASA breakthrough and SpaceX is a private company founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk that is leasing the launch pad from NASA.\nWhile it is paid to do cargo missions for NASA now, SpaceX was founded to turn commercial space travel and the colonization of Mars into reality.\nAbout 10 minutes after the launch, Falcon 9 separated from its cargo capsule, the Dragon, which holds nearly 6,000 pounds of supplies and will dock at the orbiting space station on Monday.\nThe capsule was refurbished from the SpaceX’s fourth cargo trip in September of 2014. If SpaceX succeeds in this mission, it could mark the first time a private company has been able to recycle a space craft and send it back into orbit, a step toward SpaceX’s goal of reusing most or all of its capsules.\nSpaceX has claimed a number of firsts since private space travel became legal in 2004. In 2010, its Dragon capsule was the first private cargo spacecraft to be launched into orbit and retrieved. Then in 2012, SpaceX was the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station – and has done so several times since.\nAboard the Falcon 9 on Saturday is a compacted version of scientist Thomas Hunt Morgan’s classic fly room, which is holding 400 fruit flies and 2,000 of their eggs to see how their cardiovascular health holds up in space. The pace of their heartbeats align closely with humans.\nThe capsule is also carrying 40 mice that will help researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, test a drug that stimulates bone growth to help figure out how astronauts can preserve their own bone mass on future missions, The New York Times reported. Zero gravity makes bones fragile.\nSpaceX is in the process of creating Dragon 2, which will transport crews to and from the station.\nThe rocket was originally scheduled to leave on Thursday evening, but the prospect of lightning delayed the mission to Saturday.\nA report by the University of Pennsylvania’s Public Policy Initiative laid out the implications of privatized space travel in December.\nIt noted that the government’s reliance on private companies such as SpaceX can fill voids from NASA’s budget cuts with cheaper alternatives. It compared the retired Space Shuttle program, which was costing about $4 billion a year and was cut to save money, to privatized resupply services, which cost about $50 million per launch.\nIt also emphasized prospects for exciting leaps in space exploration. But it acknowledged critics’ worries that priorities between private companies and public interest may eventually clash. And the technology is not owned by the government or shared.\n“Although there are pros and cons to privatizing space exploration, current trends suggest that many of NASA’s space exploration responsibilities are being shifted towards the private sector under government contracts,” read the report. “Whether this new model will produce discoveries and innovation in-step with former government run space research is yet to be seen.”"},{"url":"http://khn.org/news/gop-health-bill-pleases-most-republicans-but-not-many-other-americans","title":"GOP Health Bill Pleases Most Republicans, But Not Many Other Americans","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Kaiser Health News","description":"While nearly half of Americans support Obamacare, fewer than a third are in favor of the Republican replacement legislation.","date":"2017-05-31","full_text":"The health overhaul bill passed by the House earlier this month accomplishes one major feat: It is even less popular than the not-very-popular Affordable Care Act it would largely replace, a new poll finds.\nAccording to the monthly tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 49 percent of respondents said they have a favorable view of the ACA, while 31 percent said they favored the GOP’s American Health Care Act, which narrowly passed the House on May 4. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\nBut in a mirror image of the ACA’s standing with the public, more than two-thirds of Republicans said they support their party’s health plan. Even more Democrats (78 percent) favored Obamacare.\nThe findings track those of other polls conducted since the Republican House passed the bill. A Quinnipiac University poll released May 25 found 20 percent of Americans support the AHCA, compared with 57 percent opposition. A poll from Morning Consult and Politico just after the bill passed found 38 percent supported the GOP measure and 44 percent opposed it.\nUnlikely to boost the bill’s popularity is a report last week from the Congressional Budget Office that found after 10 years the legislation would result in 23 million fewer Americans with insurance and could make it harder for those with preexisting conditions to get and keep coverage.\nIndeed, the KFF poll found that even Republicans show scant support for a change to some of the health law’s most popular provisions. Fewer than a fifth of Republicans favored changing the provision that limits how much more insurers can charge older people for insurance compared with younger people. And 22 percent of Republicans favored letting insurers charge sick people higher premiums if they have a break in their coverage.\nA majority of Republicans supported the bill’s provisions that would allow states to establish work requirements for Medicaid enrollees and set up high-risk insurance pools for people with health problems.\nMore people said the GOP bill would hurt their personal health care than thought the same about a straight repeal of the ACA when asked about that issue in December.\nForty-five percent said the GOP bill would increase their own and their family’s costs for health care, compared with the December survey that found 28 percent thought that would be the result if the ACA were repealed. More than a third thought the GOP bill would make it harder to get and keep health insurance, compared with 21 percent who thought a repeal would have that consequence. And 34 percent said the GOP bill would likely make the quality of their health care worse, compared with 19 percent who said that about the ACA repeal.\nAlthough about half of the public wants changes in the bill, nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said it was very or somewhat likely that Congress will pass and President Donald Trump will sign a bill to “repeal and replace” the ACA.\nThe survey of 1,205 adults, conducted May 16-22, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for the full sample."},{"url":"http://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/2017/04/18/sally-podoskis-mentorship-improves-lives/99119344","title":"Sally Podoski's mentorship improves lives","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Post-Crescent Media","description":"Sally Podoski is being recognized for the estimated 3,000-plus hours she's put into mentoring.","date":"","full_text":"UW-Fox Valley’s Communication and Theater Arts 106 Class\nRecipient:Sally Podoski\nAward: Paul and Elaine Groth Mentoring Award sponsored by the Mielke Family Foundation.\nBiography: Podoski worked for ThedaCare for more than 30 years and retired in 2010. She resides in Neenah and spends time in a number of mentoring and volunteer positions around the Fox Valley.\nVolunteer footprint: She is being recognized for the estimated 3,000-plus hours she's put into mentoring in the Fox Valley — and the impact she has had on those around her. Podoski has also logged about 3,000 additional hours of volunteer time, according to the nomination papers.\n\"She is one of those people who inspires you to dig deeper, do more, to reach your full potential and be the best version of yourself you can be,\" said Lisa Thiede, who nominated Podoski.\nThiede has been Podoski's case manager for the 11½ years that Podoski mentored a child with Best Friends of Neenah-Menasha. They just closed the match because the child graduated, a positive reason to close a match, said Thiede, who described Podoski as someone who makes others feel that they matter.\nThiede noted Podoski's can-do attitude and said she looks at the strengths of the situation rather than focusing on the challenges.\nPodoski and her family spent time each week with her mentee, who describes Podoski as the only person who helped and encouraged her in school.\n\"She taught me how to cook and gave me tax and finance lessons. She went to every college tour and did research with me. For over 10 years she has been everything I needed: a tutor, a friend, parent-like figure, caregiver,\" her mentee wrote in the nomination papers.\nPodoski also mentors children at Roosevelt Elementary School in Neenah, starting in 2009 through the school's Backyard Buddy Program. She'll always be there for the students she mentors, teacher Susan Michlig wrote.\nAnd while Podoski mentors children, she also mentors another adult. Since 2011, she has volunteered with the Winnebago County Senior Friends program, which matches a volunteer with an older person to decrease isolation and encourage participation in the community.\nPodoski mentors a woman who is 72 years old and came to the program depressed and lonely, wrote Joanne Murphy Spice, volunteer development specialist with ADVOCAP.\nPodoski's mentorship has meant less depression for her friend and a sense of connection with the community.\n\"She knows she has a friend in Sally and someone she can turn to for advice and caring,\" Murphy Spice wrote. \"One person at a time, Sally is quietly enhancing the lives of those in her community.\"\nHer voice: \"If anything, the message I'd like to send to the general public is you can do it,\" Podoski said.\nMentorship, she said, is about doing with a mentee what you would with a niece or nephew or a friend. Podoski and the girl she mentored through Best Friends of Neenah-Menasha go on outings, but they also cook and take the dog for a walk together.\nWhen she started mentoring, she said she was working full time, had a family at home and was in graduate school.\n\"It just goes on your calendar like everything else that matters in your life,\" she said.\nBefore she retired, she was mentoring at Roosevelt and with Best Friends, which she got involved in when her daughter was 16. At that point, they decided to do something together in the community and they were paired with their mentee.\nWhen Podoski retired, she took about six months to determine what volunteer opportunities would appeal to her and realized she wanted to be directly involved with other people.\nMentors, she said, don't tell others what to do — they help find solutions. It's about being a good listener, non-judgmental and candid in giving feedback.\nAnd while mentoring involves giving, there's also a huge payback.\n\"For sure you're going to have fun,\" she said. \"For sure you're going to think in new ways. You're going to have your perspectives opened and broadened by new people in your life. I think you're going to develop new empathies. My life has been pretty easy. Some of the people I have mentored, their life hasn't been so easy.

","date":"","full_text":"The Mojave Trails National Monument in Southern California — which is one of the recently established monuments now under scrutiny by the Trump administration — surrounds a swath of land owned by Cadiz Inc. For nearly two decades, the Los Angeles-based company has been trying to build a colossal project, seeking to pump enough groundwater from a Mojave Desert aquifer to supply hundreds of thousands of customers. President Donald Trump improved its prospects by reversing Obama administration policies soon after taking office. Now, he has nominated a deputy Interior secretary, David Bernhardt, who lists Cadiz as a personal client. His law firm has long represented the company and stands to benefit from its success.\nBernhardt’s link to Cadiz is just one example of the connections between many Trump appointees and the industries that could profit from their decisions. Bernhardt’s confirmation hearing is today before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. As deputy secretary, Bernhardt would take over if Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke resigned. He would also handle conflicts between agencies: If the Bureau of Land Management sought to allow drilling or construction on land that the Park Service or Fish and Wildlife wanted to preserve, for example, Bernhardt would likely step in. As a lawyer, however, Bernhardt lobbied for agricultural and oil and gas companies and represented them in court, where he fought to weaken environmental protections and expand access to resources. Some Democratic senators and environmentalists see this as an unacceptable conflict of interest. “I am gravely concerned about Mr. Bernhardt’s record of working on behalf of corporations at the expense of the environment,” Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, the ranking Democrat of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in early May. And on May 17, 150 conservation groups sent a letter to senators to oppose his nomination, citing Bernhardt’s efforts to enrich corporations at the expense of the environment.\nBut Bernhardt’s industry credentials align with the Trump administration’s priorities: promoting fossil fuel development and rolling back regulations that hamper energy production and infrastructure projects. Justin Pidot, an associate law professor at the University of Denver and a former deputy Interior solicitor, said: “He’s the kind of nominee you’d expect from this administration.”\nRepublicans praise Bernhardt’s qualifications, noting that he served Interior during both Bush administrations and rose to be solicitor, the department’s top lawyer. “I think you have an extremely balanced, thoughtful individual who realizes Mother Earth is our life-support system,” former Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said. “(Bernhardt)’s going to look out for the life-support system for his kids.” Under Kempthorne, the polar bear was listed as threatened in 2008, marking the first time a species was protected due to climate change. The decision, which survived court challenges, is regarded as a conservation success. On the other hand, Kempthorne was following Bernhardt’s legal advice when he exempted greenhouse gas emissions from regulation under the Endangered Species Act.\nAnd Bernhardt — who likely would be tasked with sorting out department scandals as deputy Interior secretary — has been questioned about scandals at Interior under President George W. Bush. In 2007, Deputy Assistant Interior Secretary Julie MacDonald resigned after an investigation revealed that she had repeatedly altered scientists’ work to reduce protections for rare species like the greater sage grouse and the Delta smelt. Bernhardt advised MacDonald and resolved disputes she had with others at Interior, according to a report by Interior’s inspector general.\nIn the Cadiz water project, the company had planned to use a railroad’s existing rights-of-way to avoid federal permitting and build a 43-mile pipeline, partly through BLM lands. Environmental groups filed a series of lawsuits, citing concerns that pumping water from Cadiz’s private property could deplete groundwater under public land that is essential for desert wildlife.\nThe Obama administration in 2014 snarled the project with a legal memo establishing that only projects on rights-of-way essential to railroad operations were exempt from federal review. In 2015, the BLM therefore advised Cadiz it would require federal permitting. This March, however, the BLM rescind the 2014 legal memo after a bipartisan request from 18 members of Congress. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., blasted the decision: “The Trump administration wants to open the door for a private company to exploit a natural desert aquifer and destroy pristine public land purely for profit.”\nBernhardt’s law firm has stocks in Cadiz, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, and stands to profit from the project. Cadiz’s stock, which plummeted after the BLM’s 2015 decision, has more than doubled since Trump’s election, boosting the value of Bernhardt’s firm’s stock to $3 million. Under government ethics rules, Bernhardt would not personally benefit from future gains, said Interior spokeswoman Megan Bloomgren. And Bernhardt sent a letter to Interior’s ethics office saying he would recuse himself from matters involving his law firm or former clients for a year, unless he’s given special permission. During a hearing on May 18, Bernahrdt said: “I would not have any continuing interest in the firm and therefore I would have no interest in … any shares or theoretical potential for shares.”\nNonetheless, Bernhardt exemplifies the “swamp” Trump pledged to drain during his campaign, said Aaron Weiss, media director for the conservation nonprofit Center for Western Priorities, adding dryly: “If David Bernhardt recuses himself from all the issues he worked on as a lobbyist, it’s not clear he’ll have anything to do as deputy Interior secretary.”\nNote: This story has been updated to include the most recent news from a May 18 hearing regarding David Bernhardt’s nomination.\nCorrespondent Elizabeth Shogren writes HCN’s DC Dispatches from Washington.

Nearly three f…","date":"2017-06-01","full_text":"It's not just nearly three feet of extra water that's washed ashore off Lake Ontario, wrecking properties along the waterfront in Niagara County.\nNearly three feet of extra politics has washed ashore, too.\nAccording to politicians as ideologically opposite as Rep. Chris Collins and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, all that flooding is happening, at least in part, for a man-made reason: an international regulatory body's decision to allow Lake Ontario to get just a bit more full during wet times to protect the region's wetlands.\nBut, scientists don't blame the flooding on the International Joint Commission's controversial Plan 2014 to regulate Lake Ontario.\nThey blame Mother Nature, and the torrent of rainfall let loose on the region all spring.\nIn other words, one of the defining disagreements of 21st century America – one that puts politicians on one side and scientists on the other – has arrived in Western New York.\nJust as President Trump Thursday withdrew from a worldwide agreement on climate change, Collins in particular wants the IJC to abandon Plan 2014 despite what the scientists who wrote it say.\n\"While we don't agree on much, I share Governor Cuomo's opinion that the IJC blew it with Plan 2014,\" Collins said. \"Now we need to work cooperatively at all levels of government to get this plan stopped once and for all.\"\nThe debate over Plan 2014 intensified this spring amid a backdrop of flooding both along New York's Lake Ontario coastline and up the St. Lawrence River in Montreal.\nNo one can debate the extent of the damage. Cuomo has already set aside $7 million to repair damaged homes along Lake Ontario, where all that water has submerged docks, eroded breakwaters and left some waterfront homes as islands, surrounded by unwanted moats. Meantime, Radio-Canada reported that more than 2,700 homes have been flooded in the Montreal area.\nCuomo and Collins both blame the International Joint Commission – the binational body that oversees the waters shared by the United States and Canada – at least in part for the flooding.\nTo Collins, R-Clarence, the IJC's Plan 2014 is the problem.\nThat plan gives an international board an entirely new way of regulating water levels in Lake Ontario. Two dams in the St. Lawrence make Lake Ontario – the basin into which the rest of the Great Lakes drain – the only one of the Great Lakes whose level can be regulated at all. And Plan 2014 aims to do a better job of that by allowing for higher highs and lower lows than the plan it replaced.\nThe new rules call for the board that manages water levels to allow Lake Ontario to be 2.4 inches higher during the wettest times and eight inches more shallow during dry times, all because that natural cycle of wet and dry times helps preserve the region's wetlands. Plan 2014 also gives the board that sets lake levels less leeway in determining how high the water should be, instead setting them by prescribed formulas.\nImplemented in January, Plan 2014 clearly is not working, Collins said.\n“Plan 2014 increases the frequency of raising and lowering the water levels in Lake Ontario, and this fluctuation in levels has proven detrimental to the businesses and homeowners along the shoreline,\" Collins said. \"Higher highs and lower lows have always caused problems and this plan only makes matters worse.\"\nCuomo, a Democrat, isn't a fan of the IJC either.\n\"There’s no doubt that the IJC blew it,\" Cuomo said, earlier this week. \"I mean they blew it. I don’t see how you can’t debate that. And I understand that they have a lot of concerns that they have to deal with, and they’re dealing with Canada and Montreal and St. Lawrence. I represent the people of the State of New York. And the people of the State of New York are getting the short end of the stick, right? And their homes are getting flooded.\"\nViews from science\nThe scientists in charge of regulating lake levels see things differently.\nFor example, when told that U.S. politicians blamed Plan 2014 for the flooding, Gail R. Favari – secretary of the Canadian Section of the International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board – laughed.\n\"That's what politicians do,\" she said, meaning they cast blame.\nBut she and several other scientists cast blame, too – on the weather.\nThey noted that it was a weird winter and a wet spring, and said those two odd seasons combined to wreck the Lake Ontario beach summer.\nRemember all those warm spells following cold spells during the winter? The same thing happened around the St. Lawrence River, which serves as a funnel channeling the water from Lake Ontario out to sea.\nAs a result, the St. Lawrence froze over and thawed out five times between January and March – a situation that Keith Koralewski, an Army Corps of Engineers water management expert and adviser to the board that sets the lake levels, called \"unprecedented.\"\nThat situation complicated matters for the water management experts to try to regulate Lake Ontario. Favari said water managers like it when the ice on the river freezes solid and deep. When that happens, the river acts \"like a pipe\" that can swiftly carry excess water from the lake out to the Atlantic, she said.\nCritics of Plan 2014, such as Anthony McKenna, an engineer who chairs the Niagara USA Chamber Legislative Committee, argue that the water control board could have pushed more water out the St. Lawrence under its old regulatory system, but that it had its hands tied by the new regulations early this year.\nBut Favari and Koralewski said that even under the old regulatory system, the water control board would have diverted no more water up the St. Lawrence in February or March, just because it would have been dangerous to do so. That's because when the St. Lawrence freezes and thaws and refreezes again, sending more water up the river could create ice jams that would send flood waters pouring over the riverbanks.\nDue to those conditions along the St. Lawrence, the water control board had no choice but to allow Lake Ontario to get about a foot higher than normal by the end of March, the board said.\nAnd then the rains came, and came again.\nWater – and flooding\nApril proved to be 150 percent wetter than normal in parts of the Lake Ontario and Ottawa River basins, the water control board said.\nAll that water poured not just into the lake, but also into the Ottawa River, which links up with the St. Lawrence south of Montreal. The result: flooding along the Ottawa River in late April and the Montreal area in early May.\nWith the worry about ice jams abating as the weather warmed, the water control board finally increased water flows into the St. Lawrence on April 24, but only to a limited degree because flooding concerns were already increasing in Montreal.\nIf the board had really turned on the spigots in the St. Lawrence, \"there would have been catastrophic flooding in Montreal,\" Koralewski said.\nThen came May – a month where some parts of the Lake Ontario region got three times as much rain as usual. The result: Lake Ontario rose to 33 inches above the norm, flooding the shoreline, while thousands of Montreal-area residents had to be evacuated.\n\"There was nothing the regulators could have done\" to stop the flooding, said Bill Warick, a Buffalo native, former Army Corps official and now a consultant who spent years working on Plan 2014 for the IJC. \"I know the IJC didn't blow it. It was unavoidable.\"\nWarick said this year's wet weather appears to be part of a long-term cycle that also brought flooding to the lake in 1993, 1973 and 1952.\nMcKenna, the chamber of commerce official, disagreed, saying this is the greatest flooding he had ever seen and that Plan 2014 must play a role in it.\nHe noted that Plan 2014, while not predicting catastrophic flooding, did predict an extra $1 million in property damage and an extra $1 million in losses for boating interests along the south shore of Lake Ontario – meaning property owners and boaters there would be the only ones to suffer under the plan.\n\"They were warned by a number of us\" that the plan didn't give regulators enough flexibility to prevent flooding, said McKenna, whom Collins' office cited as a source on the issue.\nMeantime, Cuomo's Environmental Conservation commissioner, Basil Seggos, offered a slightly different take on things, saying the water control board should have acted to prevent the flooding.\n\"They still have the opportunity to make extreme diversions (of water) under extreme conditions,\" said Seggos. He also said the federal government should have provided some money to mitigate the annual damage that the IJC predicted would happen along Lake Ontario's southern shoreline.\nWhen asked about the great lake flooding debate, Rep. Louise M. Slaughter, D-Fairport, an epidemiologist before entering politics, took the side of scientists once again.\n\"The Army Corps and IJC have been clear that there would have been similar (water) flows under the old plan and that under the new plan water levels are possibly an inch lower,\" she said. \"Present water levels are due to the extraordinary rainfall, melting snow, and the fact that Lake Ontario acts as a drain lake.\"\nShe added: \"Anyone who blames current conditions on the new plan is playing politics.\""},{"url":"https://qz.com/995874/shallow-and-impulsive-doomsday-warnings-about-jobs-in-india-are-misguided-for-now","title":"“Shallow and impulsive”: Doomsday warnings about jobs in India are misguided, for now","author_text":"Madhura Karnik","keywords":[],"publication_text":"Quartz","description":"Automation and protectionist policies around the globe are resulting in job losses, hitting Indian employees hard.

In India’s information technology (IT) sector, thousands have been laid off from top software firms, while the manufacturing sector is under the constant threat of robots taking up human jobs.\nBut even though overall job growth is indeed slow in India, the larger story may not be as gory, and experts say we may be overreacting. “I’d like to make the case that this jobs doomsday prediction is shallow, ahistorical and impulsive,” Manish Sabharwal, CEO of TeamLease, a human resources (HR) consultancy, wrote on May 30 in The Indian Express newspaper.\nWhile robots may render some old jobs redundant, they will also create new ones. “The change will be dramatic, but unlike others who are making predictions on the future of the workforce, it will not be catastrophic,” said Harel Tayeb, CEO of New Jersey-based Kryon Systems, an automation services firm.\nTeamLease’s Sabharwal expects the industries affected today to hire in the future. “I am willing to wager that in five years, IT employment will rise from the current 3.5 million to six million; in 10 years, manufacturing employment will rise from 10% to 20% of the labour force,” he wrote.\nIn short, the job-loss apocalypse scenario is anything but real.\nIT\nPerhaps the most affected is India’s $150 billion IT industry, where employees are even unionising in response to the threat of losing their jobs. However, this general sense of fear in the industry may be unfounded because an important piece of the puzzle has been ignored: the new jobs that automation will bring with it.\n“There may be some short term-disruption (because of automation) but the focus needs to be on how you use tech to improve on what exists, and, more importantly, to find things that don’t exist yet,” Navin Budhiraja, head of architecture \u0026 technology at Infosys, told Quartz in an interview.\nA similar concern about job losses had cropped up when computers were first introduced in India, but instead of wiping out jobs they created more, said Amit Nandkeolyar, assistant professor of organisation behaviour at the Indian School of Business (ISB). “While automation will have some impact, new jobs will come up,” he explained.\nEven with the visa pressures, TeamLease’s Sabharwal believes India’s tech industry is comfortably placed. “…the passing shower of H-1B visas pales compared to the climate change in technology—all companies are technology companies, all hardware has a layer of software, data and smartphone costs are cratering, etc. And Bangalore and Hyderabad are probably the only cities in the world where you could hire 1,000 Hadoop programmers in a week,” he wrote.\nManufacturing\nIndia’s manufacturing sector has, too, witnessed low rate of job growth and isolated layoff incidents—carmaker Tata Motors has laid off some 1,500 manager-level employees. However, while firms are adopting automation, especially in the auto sector, the hiring of human labour isn’t declining. For instance, India’s biggest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, has 1,100 robots working along with 7,000 humans at its factory in Manesar, Haryana.\n“The content in a car is steadily increasing and we need a higher number of people to assemble the car as the production line would have a higher number of stops,” Deepesh Rathore of Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors, a Gurugram-based consultancy, told Quartz last month. “Looking across the supply chain (original equipment manufacturers and suppliers), I actually feel that the labour force would increase.”\nISB’s Nandkeolyar added that if customisation is needed in manufacturing, then pure automation is not the solution. “You need to have someone who will solve problems, and study customer preferences,” he said.\nMeanwhile, domestic demand is expected to revive as rural incomes inch up, which in turn will boost manufacturing. Already companies are betting on India’s consumption story. “Make-in-India could be Make-for-India till the global storm passes,” Sabharwal said in his write-up.\nFinancial services\nAnother sector that could buck the layoff trend is financial services.\nThe implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), for one, will boost employment. “On an immediate basis, our understanding is that GST shall contribute to direct employment of lakhs of youth in (the) IT and finance side to create systems to enable over 800,000 companies for GST rollout and invoicing,” Lohit Bhatia, business head, IKYA Human Capital, an HR consultancy, said in an emailed note on May 20.\nThe process of getting firms on board with GST will itself need trained professionals. In the first three to six months, companies and tax firms may need 50,000-60,000 trained professionals, Sunil Goel, managing director of executive search firm Global Hunt, told The Times of India newspaper.\nThen there’s the digital finance revolution, which is expected to create 21 million new jobs by 2025, according to McKinsey.\nSo, it isn’t time to give up yet."},{"url":"https://thedevelopmentset.com/to-the-u-s-resistance-movement-america-is-not-exceptional-9e2f007d386b","title":"To the U.S. Resistance Movement: America Is Not Exceptional","author_text":"Jennifer Lentfer","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Development Set","description":"It was Memorial Day in my rural Nebraska hometown, and I was on home leave from my aid worker job in Zimbabwe.

To picture my hometown, recall all of the images of small town America that Hollywood and political rhetoric provides: a main street, a town hall, flags flying from every pole.\nWe were gathered for the American Legion’s Memorial Day service, where the high school band played and the old men donned the record of their service via their hats and pins and saluted to each other as they once did overseas. There was reverence. There was prayer. There was patriotism.\nThe winner of the 7th grade American Legion essay contest then stepped up to the front of the room, a room used for wedding receptions, family reunions, meetings, and fundraisers. Puberty had not yet hit the boy, and his innocence glowed from the podium. I recognized him, of course, in this town of 300 people. I knew his parents, his grandparents, his aunts, uncles, cousins. I had gone to church and school with them, seen them at the grocery store and the baseball game, and waved at them as we passed each other driving down gravel roads among the endless, straight rows of corn.\nAs the MCs introduced the boy, they revealed the essay contest’s theme that year: “Why the United States is the best country in the world.” Except I knew how flawed this premise was.\nI was experiencing this same sense of community, of connectedness, in a supposed “developing nation” on the other side of the world. As I listened to all the parroted freedoms that people in the U.S. have, I whispered to my mother sitting next to me, “Doesn’t everyone think that their country is the best country in the world?” And I began thinking about all the work the U.S. resistance movement could do if they truly reckoned with how un-exceptional we are.\n“American exceptionalism” is a term that first surfaced in the 20s and 30s among U.S. socialists, and may have even appeared during the Civil War. There is nothing inherently wrong with having pride in one’s origins. We all need to feel grounded and special and part of something bigger than ourselves.\nExcept, as last November’s presidential election demonstrated, exceptionalism is dangerous when it translates to superiority. Now, 100+ days into the Trump presidency, we should recognize that the need to assert one’s intelligence, status or control is a throwback to colonization and imperialism. And that superiority is a slippery slope to supremacy.\nWhat I hope we can understand, after crossing 100 days into the presidency — and the growing U.S. resistance movement — is that we are not exceptional. Nor are our struggles particularly new.\nAround the world, people have been fighting authoritarian governments and oligarchic regimes for lifetimes, and in some cases, for generations. Citizens in the United States have an opportunity to learn from the visionary leadership of women, youth, and Indigenous people around the world.\nHere are but a few examples: In India, women are creating new models of joint land ownership. In South Africa, farming advocates are fighting large corporations like Monsanto — and winning. In Mexico, activists are building alternative local economies that are deeply inclusive, healing, and transformative.\nThat’s why it is time to remove the blinders installed by American exceptionalism. The U.S. resistance does not need to reinvent the wheel. It needs to remain humble and prioritize learning and cooperation across organizations, movements, and issues. Those with funding resources need to support more grassroots transnational work.\nCreating complex economic and political shifts requires grounded solidarity and action.\nGrassroots leaders around the world are the thought leaders and innovators within our movements.

In this context, contempt is a legal action involving the use of civil or criminal court proceedings against noncustodial parents who have fallen behind in their child support payments. Procedural justice centers on the idea that individuals’ perception of the fairness of an administrative or legal process and how they are treated during it determines how they respond to it. In child support programs, the parents’ reaction to the process can have important implications for the outcome of their cases. The goal of the demonstration is to employ techniques that are designed to increase parents’ perception of fairness in the child support process and, as a result, to improve cooperation with child support administrators, increase reliable child support payments, and reduce the ineffective use of contempt."},{"url":"http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/12/08/obesity-hunger-twin-crises","title":null,"author_text":null,"keywords":null,"publication_text":null,"description":null,"date":"","full_text":"TakePart is the digital news and lifestyle magazine from Participant Media, the company behind such acclaimed documentaries as CITIZENFOUR, An Inconvenient Truth, and Food, Inc. and feature films including Lincoln and Spotlight."},{"url":"http://www.newsminer.com/opinion/community_perspectives/mr-secretary-not-all-support-anwr-drilling/article_07825600-467d-11e7-a61a-57346e5d55ff.html","title":"Mr. Secretary, not all support ANWR drilling","author_text":"Bernadette Dementieff","keywords":["Community Perspectives"],"publication_text":"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner","description":"News-Miner Community Perspective:","date":"","full_text":"News-Miner Community Perspective:\nWhile Secretary Ryan Zinke is in Alaska for the Alaska Oil and Gas Association meeting, I’m sure he will feel warmly welcomed by industry and politicians alike. Nearly all Alaska elected officials would like to see Alaska’s vast public landscapes turned over to corporations, so that they might profit from oil before it ultimately runs dry.\nHowever I, too, have a message for Secretary Zinke. As an indigenous woman whose people have survived on this land since time immemorial, I speak with the support of my people when I say the Gwich’in Nation stands firmly against oil development in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This fragile place, easily disturbed and destroyed by development, is vital for the survival of the Gwich’in Nation. We have always, and will continue to, subsist on the Porcupine caribou herd which has its calving grounds on the coastal plain.\nWe are strong people, surviving in some of the harshest conditions on Earth for hundreds of thousands of years. But our fate is inextricably tied to the caribou. Our elders tell us: What befalls the caribou befalls the Gwich’in. We can’t just go to the grocery store for meat — the freezer-\nburned beef patties in the villages are too expensive and the junk food causes illness. We had never even heard of diabetes or high blood pressure until our people started eating processed food.\nWe can’t just move to the city — it’s not who we are. What we need to be healthy and strong is the caribou. Right now, with the coastal plain included in the president’s draft budget and our congressional leadership eager to maintain the status quo, politicians who are stuck in the past are grasping at straws and eyeing the coastal plain. However, our way of life is not up for negotiation.\nOur people’s survival is reason enough to never drill in ANWR. But this issue includes and is even bigger than us. Along with other public lands across the country — lands that we collectively hold in trust for our children — the refuge stands for what we as humans hold sacred, mysterious and wild. For many people, these lands — even places they will never visit— embody hope. If we harm the places we say are worthy of protection, what place is sacred? Is there nothing to stop corporations from destroying our children’s birthright, all in the name of digging and burning the finite resource of fossil fuel? Someday, it will all be gone, and then what do we have left? You can’t engineer a wilderness. You can’t learn from what isn’t there anymore. You can’t eat oil.\nSome people Secretary Zinke talks to will undoubtedly argue we can’t afford not to drill in places like ANWR. I know that the truth is we can’t afford to permanently destroy this place that sustains life.\nI am finishing a two-week series of meetings in the Lower 48. I’ve been visiting with indigenous leaders and local people who care, learning about what is happening in the desert Southwest and asking over and over for support in protecting my people’s ancestral homelands and way of life. I’ve been welcomed so warmly I was brought to tears. I’ve addressed a crowd with a microphone, which I don’t like to do, and I’ve answered difficult questions along the way.\nI camped in Gold Butte National Monument, where the sky was so close and beautiful I felt I could reach out and touch the stars. I met with people working hard yet again to ensure Bears Ears National Monument remains protected. I learned about the threat of toxic uranium mining faced by tribes in the Grand Canyon. On my journey, I was introduced to the incredible landscapes of the desert and the threats facing these places and the people who have been there since time immemorial. I learned that these fragile desert landscapes are like those of the Arctic: misunderstood and often cast aside as too remote or too “barren” for anyone to care about. I know this isn’t true about either place. This is about our survival. I now stand with these leaders and for these places for protection, as well as for our unity as tribes. They stand with me, too.\nI rely directly on the coastal plain of ANWR for my people’s survival. Please do not be fooled by those who would tell you all Alaskans want oil and gas development here. The corporations do not speak for Alaska tribes. As Secretary Zinke is the steward to some of the most magnificent places in the world, I ask him to talk with the Natives of this land, the people who will actually be affected by development. I’m asking him to stand with the Gwich’in Nation and with our allies across the desert Southwest to protect our homelands.\nBernadette Demientieff serves as executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, a group formed in 1988 in response to proposals to drill for oil on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge."},{"url":"http://www.yesmagazine.org/new-economy/yes-we-can-create-good-globalization-20170517","title":"Yes, We Can Choose Good Globalization","author_text":"","keywords":["David Korten Column"],"publication_text":"YES! Magazine","description":"","date":"","full_text":"“So, is globalization good or bad?” The question came from a thoughtful young colleague. And it is at the forefront of the current political debate on jobs and immigration. As we explored it, my young friend and I came to agree that it is the wrong question. We must first ask “Which globalization?”\nThe corporatist political establishment strongly favors globalization as it chooses to define the word. Corporatists dismiss as provincial, xenophobic, racist isolationists the populists of both left and right who oppose globalization.\nSo, how do corporatists define globalization? According to Merriam-Webster globalization is: “the act or process of globalizing: the state of being globalized, especially: the development of an increasingly integrated global economy marked especially by free trade, free flow of capital, and the tapping of cheaper foreign labor markets.” Merriam-Webster homes in on a fundamentally economic definition and in doing so equates globalization with the processes that facilitate the consolidation of power in the hands of global corporations.\nFor Google, globalization is simply “the process by which businesses or other organizations develop international influence or start operating on an international scale.” This definition is even narrower.\nThis leaves us with a choice between the deeply destructive globalization of corporate rule and the provincialism of isolationists. It was a choice presented to U.S. voters in the presidential contest between the corporatist Hilary Clinton and the faux-populist Donald Trump.\nA deeper perspective on globalization is beautifully summarized in this famous quotation from the distinguished economist John Maynard Keynes:\nI sympathize, therefore, with those who would minimize, rather than with those who would maximize, economic entanglement among nations. Ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel—these are the things that, by their nature, should be international. But let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, let finance be primarily national.\nThis quotation is from his article “National Self-Sufficiency” published in the June 1933 issue of The Yale Review, well before the dramatic globalization of travel, communication, trade, money, and investment of the past 60 years. Yet Keynes’ nuanced search for a proper balance between localism and globalism remains remarkably relevant to today’s political debate.\nThe past 60 years have marked an extraordinary human transition as the barriers to global travel and communication have melted away. We humans now share information, technology and culture in ways that in my childhood were scarcely a gleam in a futurist’s eye. For me and many others of my generation, our human transition to a truly interconnected global species is a living memory.\nI was born in 1937. The first transatlantic jet passenger service was initiated in 1958. North American transcontinental service followed in 1959.\nIn the mid-1960s, my wife, Fran, and I were living in Ethiopia. Our only communication beyond the capital of Addis Ababa was by snail mail and our trusty 4 wheel-drive Land Rover. Dependent on the gas we carried with us, we visited areas of Ethiopia where we traveled for days without seeing another vehicle. In 1967, I fed the research data for my doctoral dissertation into a room-sized computer using punch cards.\nNow many of the remote Ethiopian villages we visited have Internet cafes that connect their people seamlessly to all the world’s diverse inhabitants; the phone in my pocket has more computing power than that room-sized computer.\nThis monumental shift occurred in a blink of history’s eye. Still in transition, we are only beginning to sort out the choices that these changes pose.\nThe corporate-dominated, self-proclaimed “political center” calls us to press on with globalization. Meanwhile, a growing populist fervor recognizes that something is terribly wrong, that it relates to what corporatists call globalization, and that change is imperative.\nThe populist right blames government and socialism and sees unfettered capitalism as the solution. The populist left blames corporations and capitalism and calls for a stronger government hand. Both embrace partial truths, miss the bigger picture, and play into the hands of the corporatist middle that maintains its power by keeping us divided against our own interests.\nThe globalization of production and finance under the control of corporations accountable only to global financial markets threatens our species viability. This is the bad globalization we must put behind us. Material needs are better met locally whenever practicable.\nThe globalization of ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel, as Keynes suggested, is the good globalization. It raises consciousness of our common humanity, interconnection, and interdependence in ways far from isolationist or xenophobic. And it opens extraordinary creative opportunities to achieve a world of peace, material sufficiency, and spiritual abundance for all. We properly celebrate and facilitate it."},{"url":"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/South-SF-neighborhood-without-water-after-vandals-11192782.php","title":"South SF neighborhood without water after vandals strike","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"SFGate","description":"Residents of a South San Francisco neighborhood are being advised not to drink or cook with tap water after vandals broke into an area containing a storage tank.

Socks, for one. Do they match? Should he care? “How does this color thing work?” he wondered aloud in his office this week while sporting a muted gray pair that did not in fact clash.\nBut after decades as a committed seeker, he at least has found his calling. He wants to help schools build better retirement savings plans, so their teachers can leave the classroom at a time of their choosing with dignity and grace.\nHis path to that purpose had some unexpected stops along the way.\nIn his early teenage years in Naperville, Ill., Mr. Lynam dabbled in Christian fundamentalism. “I found community, family and friendship,” he said. “But the theology was very conservative.”\nThen came the longhaired hippie phase. “They talked about peace and love,” he said. “But there was a lot of smug satisfaction about shared values. What were they doing to help and serve others? The answer was, not much.”\nHe sought guidance at St. John’s College here in Santa Fe, a school known for its rigorous, traditional curriculum. “Kant and Hegel have lots of answers, but there isn’t an answer,” he said. “There are signposts.”\nAnd then came a stint in the Marine Corps Officer Candidates School in 1994 and 1995. “I didn’t want to kill people for a living,” he said. “And there was no pressing global conflict or need for my service.”\nWhile it all may seem somewhat flighty, Mr. Lynam, 43, said the bouncing around merely reflected a restless soul who was nonetheless committed to doing good. “Why did God put me on this earth?” he said. “If I can’t figure that out, how do I pick a career or spouse, or operate in the world? I felt like I needed to answer that question fundamentally before I could be of use to anyone.”\nIt was his thesis adviser from St. John’s who invited him to become a Benedictine monk, and the appeal was immediate. “If you’re really searching for the meaning of life, where better to find it than a monastery?” Mr. Lynam said.\nThe commitment required oaths of celibacy, obedience and poverty. The three monks in residence in Santa Fe did paid work as teachers and pooled their funds. One of the senior monks managed the money, Mr. Lynam said.\nBy the end of the 1990s, however, there was trouble. The three monks had never asked the public for financial support, and they didn’t take money from the Catholic Church either, as they wished to maintain their independence.\nBut poverty had turned out to be a relative term. The monks needed cars and new tires and health insurance, and they lived in a house that came with expenses. They took others on religious retreats and made trips to Rome themselves. Both older monks had brought debt to the relationship that Mr. Lynam did not know about until years into their brotherhood.\nEventually, they were so far in the hole that personal bankruptcy for all three of them was the best option for keeping the monastery intact. While Mr. Lynam did not ultimately appear before a judge in his robe, the irony and embarrassment were no fun nonetheless. “It was emotionally gut-wrenching,” said Mr. Lynam, who didn’t know much about personal finance at the time. “One of the worst things that has ever happened to me.”\nBut it also awakened something in him. The stream of visitors to his monastery would arrive with many purported reasons. As the junior monk, he did not give much religious counsel. But he soon recognized a pattern: Every person who arrived with a spiritual issue had a financial problem lurking somewhere beneath it.\n“So I would say, ‘I’ll pray for you, but let’s make a budget,’” he said. “‘Let’s start paying off student loans. Let’s get the child support you deserve.’ Prayer and contemplation can help you take more mindful action, but action is the outcome of contemplation.”\nAs a math, astronomy, economics and, eventually, personal finance teacher at Santa Fe Preparatory School, Brother Doug, as the students knew him, also became the person many colleagues turned to when they had questions about their financial lives. And when one lifelong teacher showed him her $16,000 retirement account, he was aghast.\nWhile she cried in front of him, his head exploded with questions that he did not know how to answer. Who was in charge of this plan? How did they not know that she had so little money saved? Why didn’t they tell her? And how do I fix this?\nThe questions about his school’s 403(b) plan — which is like a 401(k) for nonprofits and educational institutions, and was the subject of a five-part series that Tara Siegel Bernard and I wrote last year — led him down a yearslong rabbit hole.\nHis conclusion? “These plans have drifted for decades,” he said. “There are poor investment choices, high fees and annuities that are abusive. Schools have forgotten that they are fiduciaries, and we’re seeing retirements being torpedoed by negligence, essentially.”\nIn the world of 401(k)’s, failing to act in employees’ best interest has led to many lawsuits. But Mr. Lynam did not sue. Instead, after trying and failing to find a better firm to fix his school’s 403(b), he up and started his own, Lynam Financial Services. His solution? Give people a menu of index or similar mutual funds, enroll all employees automatically and increase their savings regularly.\nThis was, in effect, a third full-time job for Mr. Lynam — and neither monks nor teachers ever feel as if they are truly off-duty. So in the past year, he has left both teaching and the monastery. And last month, he entered a partnership with LongView Asset Management in Santa Fe. A co-founder of that firm is now a Hindu nun and a longtime assistant is now an accredited Buddhist chaplain, so the principals there did not blink at putting a former monk to work.\nMr. Lynam and I studied a few of his favorite sacred texts together, as I’ll be doing with other professional people of both faith and finance whom I will profile in the coming weeks. One story, from a book called “Tales of a Magic Monastery,” describes a parish priest on retreat who seeks guidance from a monk about his own spiritual life. His response comes in the form of a question: What do they need?\nSo has Mr. Lynam concluded that his former colleagues need him more than his former students? Not exactly. “I’m not irreplaceable in the classroom,” he said. “But I did not see another company serving teachers in the way that I can serve them. It’s not that one form of service is higher or lower.”\nIt is a very different role, though — one he describes as being a “suffering prevention specialist.” His professional conversations now feel a lot like confession, he said, with people sharing stories of unpaid debts, betrayals and sure things that were far from it. He listens, and then he must hold the mirror up to those who may not want to see the truth.\n“Perhaps one of the cardinal sins that I see the most, though it’s not a popular one to talk about, is sloth,” he said. “Some people are afraid but also a little lazy, and they don’t really want to do the hard work of facing their mistakes or lack of organization and knowledge on these subjects and take responsibility.”\nAnd yet he loves it, as he knew he would have to for it to feel he was retiring from the monastery to move toward something great. “It’s been a very circuitous journey to find out what my calling is, what is being asked of me in the truest sense, that will bring all of my being,” he said. “This requires all of my mind, heart and devotion. And that is a beautiful thing.”"},{"url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/drones-carrying-defibrillators-could-aid-heart-emergencies","title":"Drones carrying defibrillators could aid heart emergencies","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Seattle Times","description":"CHICAGO (AP) — It sounds futuristic: drones carrying heart defibrillators swooping in to help bystanders revive people stricken by cardiac arrest.

That was almost 17 minutes faster on average than ambulances — a big deal for a condition where minutes mean life or death.\nDrone-delivered devices weren’t used on patients in the preliminary study, but the results are “pretty remarkable” and proof that the idea is worth exploring, said Dr. Clyde Yancy, a former American Heart Association president who was not involved in the study.\nCardiac arrest is a leading cause of death worldwide, killing more than 6 million people each year. Most happen at home or in other nonmedical settings and most patients don’t survive.\n“Ninety percent of people who collapse outside of a hospital don’t make it. This is a crisis and it’s time we do something different to address it,” said Yancy, cardiology chief at Northwestern University’s medical school in Chicago.\nThe researchers reached the same conclusion after analyzing cardiac arrest data in Sweden, focusing on towns near Stockholm that don’t have enough emergency medical resources to serve summer vacationers. The analysis found an emergency response time of almost 30 minutes and a survival rate of zero, said lead author Andreas Claesson, a researcher at the Center for Resuscitation Science at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.\nTo see if care could be improved, Claesson’s team turned to drones.\nDrones are increasingly being tested or used in a variety of settings, including to deliver retail goods to consumers in remote areas, search for lost hikers and help police monitor traffic or crowds. Using them to speed medical care seemed like a logical next step, Claesson said.\nThe study was done last October and was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nMore than 350,000 Americans had a cardiac arrest in a nonmedical setting last year, the American Heart Association says. The condition is often confused with heart attacks but they’re different.\nHeart attacks occur when a clot or other blockage stops blood flow to the heart. Cardiac arrest occurs when electrical impulses controlling the heart’s rhythmic pumping action suddenly malfunction. The heartbeat becomes very irregular or stops, preventing blood from reaching vital organs. Death can occur within minutes without treatment to restore a normal heartbeat, ideally CPR and use of a defibrillator.\nThe researchers used a small heart defibrillator weighing less than two pounds, featuring an electronic voice that gives instructions on how to use the device. It was attached to a small drone equipped with four small propeller-like rotors, a global positioning device and camera.\nThey launched the drone from a fire station within about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from homes where people had previous cardiac arrests.\nIn the study’s video footage simulating a rescue, a drone soars over residential rooftops and then lands gently in a backyard. A man dashes out of the house, grabs the defibrillator and carries it inside.\nThere were no crashes or other mishaps during the study, Claesson said. He plans a follow-up study to test drone-delivered defibrillators for bystanders to use in real-life cardiac arrests.\nThe test results show “a great potential for saving lives,” he said.\n___\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner on Twitter: @LindseyTanner .

The findings are both encouraging and sobering.","date":"","full_text":"More states than ever are providing publicly funded preschool. That's according to a new report from the researchers at the National Institute for Early Education Research, or NIEER, who have been tracking state preschool policies and programs since 2002.\nIn 2016, the report found, 43 states, plus the District of Columbia and Guam, provide publicly funded preschool. They serve about 1.5 million children across the country — mostly 3- and 4-year-olds. Total state spending on preschool is now about $7.4 billion, an eight percent increase over last year. That increase has pushed spending to nearly $5,000 per child.\nLast year 24 states increased spending per child. California and Texas saw some of the biggest increases.\nPreschool got a pig push under the Obama Administration — and the federal preschool development grants that totaled $210 million last year were a big help.\nSteve Barnett, head of NIEER, says the numbers are encouraging, but he cautions that the quality of most preschool programs is still very uneven.\n\"The growing inequality between states that have moved ahead and invested in quality preschool programs and states that have done nothing is really stark.\"\nBarnett says the reasons for that vary. Funding is a good example.\nWashington, D.C., spends $15,748 per child. Mississippi spends less than $2,000 per child, roughly half of what states spend on average.\nThe disparities in enrollment are pretty pronounced as well.\nFlorida, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia each serve more than 70 percent of their 4-year-olds. Another 18 states serve more than a third of these kids (New York City is considering universal preschool for 3-year-olds as well).\nSeven states, NIEER says, don't fund preschool at all.\nWith the funding issue comes the perennial question: Is the investment justified by the results?\nThe growing consensus among researchers, including folks at NIEER, is that the highest-quality programs are well-funded. The poorest-quality programs, surprise surprise, are not. But the support for preschool funding often depends on whether programs target low-income kids or middle-income children — often called \"universal\" programs.\n\"The difference between universal and targeted [programs] is the difference between public education and charity,\" says Barnett. \"Should [preschool] be segregated by income?\"\nThe NIEER report doesn't really get into that question, but previous research suggests that state lawmakers are more likely to fund and expand preschool programs if they benefit moderate- to middle-income families, and not just the poor.\nBarnett says he worries about programs that fall short of the quality standards NIEER has set for all kids — regardless of income.\n\"If you have large classes with teachers who really don't know child development or how to teach, this can be very stressful for kids,\" he says.\nThe good news, says Barnett, is that state-funded preschool programs are better today than they were just 10 years ago. Quality has improved in states like Alabama, North Carolina, Rhode Island and West Virginia, in large part because they've invested in smaller class sizes and quality teachers."},{"url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/05/objectivity-in-minds/525036","title":"Is Psychiatry Partisan?","author_text":"James Hamblin","keywords":["The Atlantic","The Atlantic Magazine","The Atlantic.Com","Atlantic","News","Opinion","Breaking News","Analysis","Commentary","Business","Politics","Culture","International","Science","Technology","National And Life"],"publication_text":"The Atlantic","description":"A debate on the nature of expertise in mental health could decide three people’s lives, and many more to come.","date":"","full_text":"Minutes before Don Davis was to be executed last month, word came from the U.S. Supreme Court not to proceed. For now, Davis is still alive, a convicted murderer among the survivors of Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson’s April rush to execute eight death-row inmates before state’s supply of midazolam expired and could no longer be considered safe to use in bringing about death.\nThe execution, along with that of inmate Bruce Ward, was stayed based on a legal question over what sort of mental-health assistance indigent defendants should receive. Davis was sentenced to death after evaluation at a state hospital and denied a mental-health expert to assist in his defense. His case raised the same question that is currently before the Supreme Court in McWilliams v. Dunn.\nThat case goes back to 1986, when James McWilliams was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a convenience-store clerk in Alabama. McWilliams did not receive a mental-health expert to assist in his defense, and the state claimed that he was only entitled to a court-appointed expert—one who would be shared by the prosecution and defense.\nThat psychiatrist testified that McWilliams had no serious mental illness but had tried to feign one. A stack of health records landed on the desk of his attorney shortly before the trial with no one to interpret or make sense of their implications.\nSo the question is whether this sort of mental-health assessment, from a court-appointed expert (often referred to as a neutral or independent expert) is sufficient and fair. McWilliams’s case argues that indigent defendants claiming to be mentally ill or incompetent to stand trial must be provided with a psychiatrist who will work with the defense, confidentially, in assessing these claims.\nScott Braden, who represents Davis and Ward, said in a statement: “The Arkansas Supreme Court recognized that executing either man before the court answers this question for Mr. McWilliams would be profoundly arbitrary and unjust.”\nAnd so while this question remains open before the U.S. Supreme Court, these men’s lives hang in the balance.\n* * *\n“Independent expert is a misnomer,” said Jessica Brand, legal director of Harvard University’s Fair Punishment Project and a long-time defense attorney. “When people are appointed as experts, they’re coming in with all kinds of biases. And people who are appointed by the trial court, who do they want to please? The trial judge. Defense counsel has very different interests. That is hugely problematic.”\n“What would it mean if an expert said the defendant’s affect is flat, for example?” posits Stephen Lally, a professor of forensic psychology at Argosy University. “There is an important role to be played simply in interpreting technical terminology. Having just one expert doing the quote-un-quote neutral evaluation doesn’t fill that need.”\nThere is also the question of confidentiality. A meaningful psychiatric evaluation involves candor and disclosure about all aspects of life. Anything less can compromise the objectivity of the endeavor. As Brand put it, “If you’re giving this information to someone who’s going to report back to the trial judge and prosecutor, you have no idea what they’re going to do with that information.”\nThis is the perspective that seemed to be shared by Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer during hearings in McWilliams v. Dunn last week. Kagan quoted what she called the “money sentence” from the precedent-setting case:\n“We hold that when the defendant makes this preliminary showing that mental health is going to be at issue, the State must assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.”\nMeanwhile the state’s briefs have argued that McWilliams is requesting “partisan experts.” Using the phrase repeatedly highlights a contrast to the seemingly preferable “independent experts.” McWilliams attorneys reply that of course such “partisan experts” are exactly the type that is hired by defendants who can afford the cost.\nWhat may have been the key counterpoint, though, came last week from Justice Neil Gorsuch: “Where’s the stopping point? Is it just psychiatry? Would we also have to apply the same rule in other kinds of medicine, perhaps?”\nThis is the question, then, and it gets to one at the heart of psychiatry. Is mental health to be understood and approached in the same way as other areas of medicine? Should it try to be? That basic conceptualization of the field seems to be what makes the question of neutral or impartial experts so divisive.\n* * *\n“Mental health is at least somewhat unique, because for centuries there has been a concern that we not act against people who lack basic mental capacity to make decisions on their own,” said John Petrila, a forensic-psychology scholar with Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute in Dallas. “It involves a certain amount of analysis and intricacy that is different from other areas of science or medicine.”\nIn recent decades, psychiatry has been pulled between two conceptual poles. One is a more empirical, medical model of disease based on objective sets of diagnostic criteria, labels, and standardized treatment approaches. The other is a more individualistic approach in which every case is unique, and the practice is entirely reliant on diagnostic insights and expert opinions that can only come from one-on-one interviews.\nThe latter approach has posed problems of legitimacy for the field throughout the years. In studies of people who are seen by more than one psychiatrist, the consistency of the diagnosis varies. One may consider you depressed and suggest a serotonin-modulating pill, while another may say no such thing. This degree of variation is less common in other medical specialties, as is the basic fact that few objective standards exist by which any given psychiatrist’s diagnosis can be proven right or wrong.\nStill, many in psychiatry have formally and forcefully resisted a move toward using concrete metrics to make diagnoses. This makes the question of neutral or impartial experts difficult. And this fundamental debate has recently been brought to a pitch by the arguments in the field that have erupted during and since the election of Donald Trump. Some believe that if there are objective measures by which illness can be assessed, then it should be possible to diagnose a person who has lived such a public life as Trump. In The New York Times, for example, 33 mental-health professionals wrote to the editor:\nMr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists). In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.\nSome mental-health professionals have taken this argument further, applying diagnostic labels like narcissistic personality disorder and anti-social personality disorder. These psychiatrists and psychologists see it as an abdication of their professional ethics to stay silent while a mentally ill person is in a position to do harm to many people.\nThat’s the sentiment in a petition with 53,000 signatures from people who claim to work in mental health. “We, the undersigned mental-health professionals,” it begins, “believe in our professional judgment that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States.”\nThe petition was authored and championed by John Gartner, a clinical psychologist based in Maryland and the author of The Hypomanic Edge: The Link Between (a Little) Craziness and (a Lot of) Success in America. Hypomania is a sort of step below mania, where a person is functional but on the brink—“high energy” if you will.\nWhen I met Gartner, he might have qualified as hypomanic, in the rate of his speech and the breadth of this thoughts and borderline obsession with the cause of diagnosing Trump. (“I am an expert in malignant narcissism, and in 35 years of practicing and teaching, this is absolutely the worst case I’ve ever seen, the most malignant, the most destructive.”)\nThough I shouldn’t call him hypomanic. Using diagnostic terminology for anyone who is not your own patient—anyone who has not consented to being diagnosed and whom you have not evaluated in person—is regarded as unethical by the American Psychiatric Association. This has been the group’s explicit rule since the 1964 Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater sued the editors of the magazine Fact over its publication of “The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater.” The issue put forward 1,189 psychiatrists who “say Barry Goldwater is psychologically unfit to be president!”\n“They were using psychoanalytic terms that required belief in inferential things about what was going on in his head,” Gartner recounted to me. “So, if he had an Oedipus complex conflict or was a latent homosexual, or if he was an anal character with potty training issues. So, he sued them. And he won. And he should’ve won because it was libel.”\nBut since then, some psychiatrists have argued that the rule is too sweeping. As a 2016 article in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatric Law argued, “Some third-party assessments are reckless, but [that does] not negate legitimate reasons for providing thoughtful education to the public and voicing psychiatric concerns as acts of conscience.” Gartner says much the same. He believes the science of the field as advanced enough to make the Goldwater rule less necessary and occasionally even inappropriate. He traces his reasoning to the publication of the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), published in 1980. In writing that edition, the eminent psychiatrist Robert Spitzer led an overhaul of the book that resulted in hundreds more pages outlining 265 categories of disorders. This edition left the DSM looking less like a simple dictionary of psychiatric terminology and more like a compendium of diagnostic criteria.\n“The major improvement that Robert Spitzer wanted to make was that mental disorders should be diagnosable by clearly observable behaviors,” said Gartner. “So, things that aren’t based on inferences about inter-psychic processes, but things that basically anyone can observe.”\nThis is how Gartner and many of his co-signers now understand the manual. He read to me from the DSM’s list of “criteria for personality disorders.” In the case of anti-social personality disorder, they include: “exploitation as a primary means of relating to others, including by deceit and coercion; use of dominance or intimidation to control others … embellishment or fabrication when relating events,” and “anger or irritability in response to minor slights and insults.” Gartner points to multiple specific instances of these behaviors being recorded in the public record and corroborated by multiple witnesses.\n“These are facts, insofar as facts exist,” he said. “And I think it’s important that we do stick to that idea that facts exist.”\nIf it were so straightforward, of course, the question before the Supreme Court would be almost moot. A neutral, independent psychiatrist would be able to give an objective evaluation based on clearly observable or quantifiable evidence.\nBut this is where the American Psychiatric Association has pushed back hard.\n* * *\nIn the wake of so many psychiatrists attempting to apply diagnostic labels to Trump, this March the APA reaffirmed its support for the Goldwater rule. In a new statement from its ethics committee, the organization insisted that psychiatrists “should not give professional opinions about the mental state of someone they have not personally evaluated.”\n“Such behavior compromises both the integrity of the psychiatrist and the profession,” the statement read. “When psychiatrists offer medical opinions about an individual they have not examined, they have the potential to stigmatize those with mental illness.”\nWhy, though, if there is an objective set of criteria, and a person has publicly displayed behavior that very clearly meets those criteria, should remote diagnosis never be possible?\nRebecca Brendel, a psychiatrist at Harvard’s Center for Bioethics, worked with the APA on the statement. As she explained it to me further, “The DSM has lists of criteria, but if you look in the front of the book, it says specifically, this is not a checklist, and it’s not a cookbook. A patient could have every single thing on that list and not have that illness. Or they could have none of the things on that list and have the illness.”\nThe APA’s position is that it would simply never be possible for mental-health professionals to use diagnostic language for anyone who is not their patient. Even if an elected official began––for example––insisting that the election he won had been rigged against him. Even if he did this while wearing a tin-foil hat. And this insistence—that there is simply no objective set of observable behaviors that can be said to constitute mental illness—poses challenges judicial situations. It becomes easy to dismiss an expert as “partisan.” Even a jury made up entirely of psychiatrists could not rightly judge a person to be mentally ill.\n“Where you’re talking about areas where there is a standard protocol and scientific methodology—like with DNA testing—there are a very specific, validated steps that every examiner is supposed to follow,” said Brand, the defense attorney with the Fair Punishment Project. “And you can cross-examine an expert on it. Whereas when you’re talking about forensic psychiatry and forensic psychology, those fields are just, they’re—malleable isn’t quite the right word. But they really require a lot more subjective analysis.”\nSo what happens when that expert opinion is based largely on the words of the patient? And the disorder in question is characterized by deceitfulness?\nLen Cruz spent 12 years as a psychiatrist in the U.S. Air Force, where he faced similar dilemmas. He tells me it was common for commanding officers to send him troops who had been “exhibiting unusual behavior” and ordering them to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Among the ethical challenges, Cruz recalled to me earlier this year, was that officers were often sent to him who didn’t want to be there. “How do you penetrate beneath the surface to try to determine is this soldier is, you know, faking? There are some ways, but, boy, that’s not an easy interview.”\nThe question is obviously especially consequential when deeming a person malingering means they could be put to death. In assessing a person’s capacity in court, psychiatric diagnosis tend to be “of secondary importance,” explains Petrila, the forensic-psychology scholar. A person might be under tremendous stress, and have bipolar disorder, but if the person has a basic understanding of what the legal system intends to do, then they can be deemed competent to be executed. “The question is, is the person able to make decisions, to take in information. And it’s based on imprecise measures.”\nPetrila thinks that guaranteeing access to mental-health experts is, in principle, a good thing. “But I’m also mindful that you don’t want to have kind of avalanche of experts. So now the prosecution has theirs, I’ve got mine. They disagree. So now we want a third expert, you know. It can become ludicrous,” he said.\n“I’m in favor of the principle if it serves fairness,” he added, “but I’m not under any illusion that it solves quality issues or creates efficiency.”\nFrom the subjectivity of diagnoses to the imprecision of assessing competence, mental health does seem unique among medical specialties. Gorsuch’s concern for a slippery slope could well be misplaced.\n“I think mental health issues are unique because when you're talking about criminal prosecution, that that's where the relevant issues are,” said Stephen Lally. “And as a question of resources, yes, it would be cheaper to say nobody has such a right. Just like it would be cheaper in terms of resources to say that we don't have a right to an attorney. But in a justice system that values fairness and a level playing field, it just seems like an important part of that is allowing the defendant to have access to a mental health expert who could help clarify and consult.”\nOf course, acknowledging subjectivity and uniqueness of mental health do not—I think it’s important to state clearly—delegitimize the profession or challenge the reality of anyone’s suffering. Attempts to squeeze mental illness into the same medical model as orthopedic surgery and dermatology, though, do seem to. It may simply be that mental health is orders of magnitude more complex and deserves to be regarded accordingly.\nNo one I spoke with has a good sense of where the Supreme Court will come down in June. All expect it to be close."},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-05-17/chibok-girls-are-still-custody-and-their-parents-are-still-desperate","title":"The Chibok girls are still in custody, and their parents are still desperate","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Public Radio International","description":"About 100 kidnapped Chibok girls have been released, but they still don't get to go home.","date":"","full_text":"RTSEVKB.jpg\nAfter the release of 82 girls from Boko Haram captivity was announced this month, several of the missing girls’ parents set off from their remote hometown in northeast Nigeria to Abuja, the capital, to see the girls in person. The three represented parents of more than 200 girls kidnapped in April 2014, who have formed an association to work with the government and others for their release.\nA few days later, the parent representatives headed back to Chibok — a journey that takes more than 24 hours by road — with a stack of photographs. The last time a group of the girls was released, in October, spelling errors misidentified some of them, which led to parents turning up in Abuja when their daughters were not actually among the freed.\nThis time, families of the missing girls will first identify their daughters with the aid of the photographs sent to Chibok. Those certain that their relatives are among the released will then leave for Abuja this Friday to be reunited with them.\nBut the reunion will be brief. The girls still can't go home. They are being kept in government custody for ongoing debriefing, and there's no word yet on when they may be let out.\nHundreds of relatives in Chibok have now been waiting years for word on their daughters and sisters.\nYana Galang is one of the parent leaders who met with the released girls in Abuja earlier this month, tasked with carrying their photos back to Chibok. Galang is doing this work in the midst of deep disappointment that her own daughter, Rifkatu, was not among the released.\n“We will gather the parents together … to show them the photographs,” she said last week. “They all live in different villages that are far apart so we can’t reach all of them immediately.\"\nZannah Mustapha, the 57-year-old lawyer who has been negotiating between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, recently told the media that some of the kidnapped girls still held by the terror group don't want to return home.\nGalang says she also heard this from some of the released girls she met with — but she’s hopeful the captives who want to stay with Boko Haram will change their minds.\n\"The released girls told me the names of at least five girls who say they do not want to come back home,” she said. “They say that they are newly married. But, with God, all things are possible.\"\nGalang said she did not plan to share the names of the girls who don't want to come home with their parents, so as not to upset them.\nAs soon as Philip Yama heard that the association officials had returned from Abuja, he rushed to Galang’s house. The 43-year-old tailor was eager to confirm whether his younger sister was among the released. Margaret, 21, had lived under his care before she was abducted. He paid her school fees, and she was like a big sister to his four young children.\nYama could hardly contain his delight when Galang handed him the photo of a tall, dark young woman, who was undoubtedly his sister. He and Margaret are spitting images of one another.\n\"I went to the market and bought flour to make some cakes for her, and also some groundnut cakes and chinchin [a fried snack], things I know she has not eaten in a while. My wife will cook it, and we will take it to her,” Yama said Friday, eager for the trip to Abuja this week that will reunite him the girl he last heard from three years ago when she phoned home to say Boko Haram had invaded her school.\nBut, there is an aspect of the reunion with his sister that worries Yama. Their mother died a year after Margaret was abducted, and he is reluctant to break the bad news to her.\n\"I will tell her, but not this time around,” he said, explaining that he plans to fabricate a reason for why his mother could not make the trip to Abuja. “If I tell her now, the trauma will be too much. I will tell her after some months.\"\nYama believes that the illness which led to his mother’s death was brought on by worry over the abduction of Margaret and his cousin, Asabe, who also lived in his house. Asabe was among the earlier batch of 21 girls freed by Boko Haram in October 2016.\n\"My mother was well before the kidnapping. Because of Margaret and Asabe, that is why she developed sickness,\" he said.\nSamuel Yaga and his wife Rebecca live in Abuja, but their daughter is also among the girls kidnapped from Chibok. They’ve seen photographs of the released girls published in the media. They were not able to identify Sarah among the faces but are confident that she will come home to them one day.\nThere have long been concerns that the Chibok girls might be radicalized while in captivity. The stigma of their ordeal could also be a factor for girls hesitant to return.\nYaga, however, dismisses accounts that some of the girls refuse to return home, insisting that this must be a rumor started by politicians with unknown motives.\n\"How can the girls say they don't want to return home?\" he said. \"If they really said that, then it means that their heads are not correct, that something is wrong with their thinking.\"\nAdaobi Tricia Nwaubani reported from Abuja, Nigeria.\nOne more thing…\nPRI takes a global approach to the news of the day.

The country where I studied 13 years ago is stunningly beautiful, but it never struck me as a glowingly joyous place, with its dark winters and reserved citizens. What secrets of a happy life could I learn from this northern country of just 5 million people?\nOnly a return trip could answer that question. My journey included a pit stop in Stockholm, a three-day passage through the capital city of Oslo, a couple of days in the fjords and fjells (mountains) and a three-day rest in Bergen, where my great-grandfather trained as a blacksmith. As a kind of “happiness” insurance, I was in Norway during the national festival known as Syttende Mai, literally, the 17th of May, the anniversary of the signing of Norway’s constitution. The holiday brings out locals in handmade traditional clothing, marching bands, children’s parades and lots of pølser (hot dogs) and ice cream. Still, my first conversations proved disheartening.\n“What does ‘happiness’ even mean?” Ewa Victoria Westman, a Stockholm tour guide, asked with perhaps a bit of envy. “I don’t see the Norwegians as much happier than us Swedes.”\nIn Norway, Inger Brøgger Bull, a librarian in Oslo, didn’t understand this new rating: “Happiness? We have bad weather, the highest prices of beer, things are so expensive!”\nThough I lived in Norway for one year and studied the language for almost three, I realize now that I had never even learned the Norwegian word for “happy.” Was this because it’s bad form for Norwegians to brag about their good fortune? Gledelig is more “gladly” than “happy.” Too much has been made out of the Danish word hygge, which actually comes from Norwegian, and means to get cozy and snug. Trivelig, or thriving, is perhaps the best translation. Knut Bull, a curator at Norway’s National Museum, suggested “Lykkelig, which defines those precious moments when everything comes together.”\nMany Norwegians consider Bergen a particularly cheery city, so I began my tour here with Syttende Mai, Constitution Day. “The people in Bergen are called ‘The Italians of Norway’ because they are direct, have great parties, and gesture with their hands,” my guide Kay said.\nIn a city known for rain, the sun beamed down and warmed festivalgoers dressed in traditional bunader (or at least suit and ties), who vigorously waved flags, exclaiming, “Gratulerer med dagen!” (congratulations on the day). I’d never seen such an outpouring of joy, fun and kindness. I expected garbage everywhere, but after more than 100,000 people left the streets, I saw just two littered beer cans. The only person who didn’t seem happy was Norway’s glum king, who appeared on television on his balcony in Oslo and wouldn’t even crack a smile or sing the national anthem.\nLesson 1: Let kids roam free\nThe 17th of May celebration began with a 2½-hour barnetoget, or children’s parade. Kari Smith, a professor of education from Bergen, said making happy citizens starts with kids becoming “complete human beings” through the Norwegian education system that integrates them into the culture. “Children are happy in school,” she stressed, and made a jab at the much-touted educational system in Finland: “Finnish children are among the lowest in terms of happiness.”\nNorwegian children don’t receive any grades throughout elementary school. This is perhaps a reflection of fri oppdragelse, or free upbringing, a Norwegian-embraced theory that children shouldn’t be held back or scolded. Inger and Knut let their 13-year-old daughter travel alone around Oslo on trams, buses and even ferries to visit friends on the other side of town. “I have to be willing to let other people take part in my daughter’s upbringing,” Inger explained. “Norwegian kids have good relations with their parents. We’re not too authoritarian and don’t give orders.”\nEven during the Syttende Mai festival in Bergen, young kids gathered with no apparent supervision. “Kids are free to roam,” said my friend Jarle Nesvaag. “There are no body snatchers here, ha ha!”\nThat said, the specter of the terrible home-grown terrorist attack in 2011 that killed 77 people, mostly kids, looms over the country. Torstein, a German bus driver who works in Norway, told me, “Nothing changed after that terrorist attack whereas in Stockholm and Frankfurt, it’s all militarized.” I did notice for the first time that a policeman in a flak jacket with a submachine gun guarded one of the entrances to Bergen’s parade route. Even so, the Bergen area, with more than 400,000 people, has only one to three homicides a year.\nLesson 2: Actually, let everyone roam free\nMy train ride from Bergen to Oslo brought me over the lush green hills of the Numedal Valley, cut with waterfalls rushing down to the valley. Such beauty is why so many of the Norwegians with whom I spoke listed nature as an important aspect of their happiness.\nWhen I lived in Norway, people would greet us only out in the countryside, as though the city was stifling them. Fortunately, all cities in Norway are nestled near wilderness, which is easily accessible by public transportation.\nLater, when I spoke with Jarle, I understood better why natural beauty is so important to the Norwegian national character. Jarle explained the importance of jordnær, or nearness to the Earth, which includes embracing your past. “My parents were hard workers, fishermen and farmers. Happiness is about accepting who you are: your family history and what your past is. Don’t deny where you are from and what your parents have done to get you where you are,” he said.\nMuch of this involves a constant celebration of all things Norwegian, such as Syttende Mai.\nKnut told me about Sakte-TV, or “Slow TV,” with cameras filming the seven-hour train ride from Bergen to Oslo and the 134-hour coastal steamer trip from Bergen to Russia. “Now they’re filming the salmon spawning, the reindeer herds moving, and someone knitting a sweater. I don’t know of anyone who watched it,” Knut admitted. As I traveled again on the train trip between Oslo and Bergen, shooting blurry photos out the window, I understood why Norwegians would want this beauty to enter their living room.\nBeing out in nature is considered a right in Norway, enshrined in a law called allemannsretten, or “everyone’s right” to roam free. No one absolutely owns the land since anyone can come and camp there for a night. “You just need to clean up in the end and not sleep on the farmer’s doorstep,” Jarle told me.\nLesson 3: Take vacation\nTime off, presumably to spend in nature, is codified in Norway as well. “Leisure time is respected by the government,” Kari Smith said. “We use the nature and we have the money to enjoy it. We have three weeks of continuous vacation.” Employers are required to give employees at least 25 days of paid vacation annually.\nMany Norwegians told me, “Det finnes ikke dårlig vær, bare dårlige klær,” or there is no bad weather, only bad clothes. In other words, you have no excuse not to go outside. The rainy day in the fjords only heightened the drama when the sun poked through. Kids in damp Bergen typically trudge around in raincoats, pants and Wellingtons. Norwegians often have their skis ready to go as soon as the snow falls and the famous “Norwegian rucksack” packed for an adventure with a sweater, swimsuit, umbrella, and perhaps a smørbrød (sandwich) and thermos of hot cocoa. Jarle said, “I pack a bottle of Champagne, too, for all sorts of surprises.”\nLesson 4: Share the wealth\nDenmark has consistently been the happiest place on Earth, so why did Norway take the prize this year? Minnesotan teacher Emily Helgerson, who is teaching in Copenhagen, asked the question of her third-grade Danish students.\n“They only got it because they have so much money,” little Buster complained, and his classmates Rebecca, Sophia and Parsa enthusiastically agreed. They assured their teacher that Denmark is still better.\nStine Hølmoy, a 24-year-old from Geilo, Norway, disagreed. “No! It’s that we’re equal and no one has so much more money than someone else.”\n“It’s not just the money,” Kari Smith told me. “You can get sick without having to worry. We don’t have to have the daily struggle of how is it going to be tomorrow.”\nStill, it doesn’t hurt to have nearly a trillion dollars saved in the government pension fund. Jarle Nesvaag pointed out that this money from the state-owned oil company “can’t be invested in tobacco, fracking, ammunition, but only ethical investments. We’ve invested heavily in hydro power, high tech, batteries, curing cancer. … Norway is the only major country with no foreign debt.”\nKnut Bull pointed out that the pension fund is thanks to Farouk al-Kasim, an oil engineer from Iraq who married a Norwegian; he knew Norway needed foreign investment to establish drilling technology, but also knew not to sell it to a foreign country and to plan wise investments early on.\nSissel Robbins, a Norwegian teacher in Trondheim, said, “The government is only allowed to use 3 percent of the oil fund every year to balance the budgets. I think most people pay their taxes and fees with pleasure, knowing that they get so much back: free education through college, a generous pension, free hospital treatment, generous parental leave of one year at full pay.”\nLesson 5: Embrace a communal spirit\nWhen I asked Norwegians why they are so darned happy, their answers began with “we” rather than “I.”\nWhile many people base happiness on how they are doing compared with others, Norwegians seem to want everyone to do well.\n“You have to know about dugnad,” Knut told me cryptically. This old Norse word essentially means volunteer work. “All neighbors chip in and help because you never know when you’ll need help. You have few resources, so you may need some in the future. This is why Norwegians seem eager to pay taxes.”\n“There are always freeloaders, though,” Knut confessed. “I think that perhaps we Norwegians have become a bit smug since we consider ourselves so peaceful and helpful. It’s not so nice when Norway considers itself a bit better than other places.”\n“I don’t agree with you,” wife Inger rebutted, and explained that this openness to helping others is the essence of Norway’s success. “We have a willingness to give up part of ourselves for the whole.”\nWhen I considered if this Norwegian model would work to help make the U.S. “happier,” Jarle responded, “I don’t know if our system would work in America since Scandinavians, with Finland and Iceland, are only about 25 million people compared to 320 million in the U.S. Maybe, one state — perhaps Minnesota? — could do it!”\nEric Dregni is the author of “In Cod We Trust,” “Vikings in the Attic” and most recently “You’re Sending Me Where?

Its impact on California’s economy in 2015 alone was estimated at $2.7 billion dollars and 21,000 jobs lost. Thanks to El Niño, this drought has eased some, but 42 percent of the state is still in a condition of extreme drought.\nIn 2007, there was a drought that didn’t garner quite the same national attention: Atlanta, Georgia was in a state of exceptional drought from September to December and came within a few months of running out of water. A large American metropolitan area running out of water almost certainly would have required driving in massive trucks of water every day just so that people could wash their hands, drink, and use the bathroom.\nTo address the impending disaster, Georgia’s governor led several hundred people in prayer, without leading an official effort to reduce water demand or increase supply.\nUnlike California’s drought, Atlanta’s was not unprecedented. Droughts of equivalent severity occur about once a decade, but the region’s population had grown by 25 percent in the previous decade, and an increase in water-intensive agriculture was putting stress on the system even before dry weather limited Atlanta’s supply.\nGrowing urban populations and increasing demand are likely to make water scarcity much more common, not just in Atlanta and California, but across the US and in most arid parts of the world. What’s worse is that these expectations do not take into account the effects of continuing climate change, which will put additional stress on water supplies in many regions.\nUnpredictable or complex?\nBut we are not helpless observers. We can use ideas from complex systems science to find ways to improve the water supply system we have so that it better serves today’s needs. First, it helps to think about what we control and what we don’t.\nDroughts are an expression of natural conditions: lower than usual precipitation, drier soil, and low stream flow. They result from normal and recurring weather variations. We can’t predict when a drought will begin or end or how bad any given drought will be, but we do know from hundreds of years of meteorological records how often droughts of a given severity can be expected to occur.\nWater scarcity, on the other hand, occurs when people want more water than is available. This distinction matters: droughts often cause water scarcity, but the social and economic disruptions that follow from drought are a result of how water is managed, not because droughts can’t be anticipated.\nThis is not to say that water managers are doing their jobs badly. Our water system relies on close couplings between the hydrological and ecological contexts and the water distribution infrastructures we have built, as well as the social, economic, and legal institutions that have developed in this context. No single group or perspective can address all these features simultaneously.\nThis multifaceted complexity is why water allocation problems today are so wickedly difficult to solve. But solve them we must. Uncertainty over water access is inhibiting innovation, damaging ecosystems, and limiting economic growth.\nWater is not gold\nIf the system isn’t working but it’s no one’s fault, how did we get here? The core ideas of the legal infrastructure that allocates water in the Western US were developed during the Gold Rush era of the mid-1800s and relied on legal precedents that determined allocation of mineral rights. This system gave ownership of the land and any minerals thereunder to the first person that invested the hard physical labor of digging for gold on that claim.\nIf a claim was abandoned, the next miner who started digging earned the right to any minerals he found there. This requirement, that a resource be used to maintain ownership, prevented miners from “staking their claim” to more land than they could reasonably work. It also provided a legal mechanism that allowed somebody else to use the resource if a miner disappeared or died. The two underlying legal principles that resulted from this system are known as “prior appropriation” and “beneficial use.”\nBut water is not gold. Unlike gold, water quickly moves from claim to claim through rivers and underground aquifers. This fluidity makes owning water much harder than owning gold. As a consequence, we define water use rights based on the expectation that there will be water in a stream, lake, or well during a given season if it has been there in the past.\nWhen hydrological and human water use patterns are consistent over a period of many years, understanding the detailed hydrology doesn’t matter much, because water rights can be granted based on expected conditions. This is how the principle of prior appropriation is applied to water: if water is generally available in a place and time, the first claimant is granted the right to use water there as long as they maintain continuous use.\nCrucially, once a water right has been established, any change in use from the right holder is only permitted if it doesn’t damage other established users. If a pair of water users would like to arrange a water transfer between themselves, they need to demonstrate that this transfer won’t harm any other users.\nConsequences\nWater transfer is why the Salton Sea in California still exists. In 1905, an engineering accident led to the Colorado River overflowing into irrigation canals and from there into a dry prehistoric lake bed; for almost two years thereafter, nearly the entire flow of the Colorado River was diverted, creating today’s 350 square mile Salton Sea.\nThe lake was quickly put to beneficial use, even though its only continuing water source was wasted irrigation runoff from those same irrigation canals. People drawn to the new inland lake quickly made the Salton Sea a tourist and recreational destination, and migratory birds and endangered fish have incorporated the lake into their ecological niches.\nIn recent decades, thirsty cities like San Diego have looked to the Salton Sea as a water source, but based on the legal principle of prior appropriation and beneficial use, any claim they make is junior to the lake’s established users.\nDespite this, in 2003 the Imperial Irrigation District and San Diego agreed to a water transfer. San Diego would pay for efficiency improvements in Imperial’s irrigation systems, and the city could then use the water saved to support its rapidly growing population.\nBut the agreement, which seemed like a win-win, presented a conundrum. By using more efficient irrigation technology, the Imperial Irrigation District would have reduced the agricultural runoff that had fed the Salton Sea. This reduction would have, in turn, damaged the lake’s ecosystem and thus the users, who argued that they had been putting the ignored agricultural runoff to beneficial use for decades.\nThis, in turn, made it much more difficult for the irrigation district to invest in more efficient irrigation technology and sell the savings to a thirsty city. San Diego and Imperial’s agreement did eventually get modified and approved, but only after a long legal battle with the lake’s user groups.\nComplex and tangled social-legal-economic circumstances like these are why water transfers are contentious, uncertain, and rare. Still, transfers are the only way to allow our allocation system to adapt to changing use patterns as the population continues to grow and new industries rise, fall, and evolve.\nPut another way, the complex system of water supply, demand, and use is evolving, but the legal system by which it is managed is locked rigidly in place.\nWhere might we go from here?\nThe doctrine of prior appropriation worked well while there was still unclaimed water available, but that era is over. Severe droughts like California’s and increasing demand like Atlanta’s, both ubiquitous features of our modern water climate, highlight the two faces of scarcity.\nThanks to increasing population, climate variability, and changing demand patterns, water scarcity will be a significant constraint in the Western US for the foreseeable future. There is no new water to allocate, and so the water management task now is to make the best possible use of the water resources that are available.\nMost conventional thinking about the water system ignores the deep complexities of water scarcity; as a society we think of taking shorter showers. Other oft-proposed solutions are big infrastructure projects to import water from somewhere else or investments in expensive water supply technologies such as desalination plants.\nWater conservation and new technology will help us make better use of our resources. They are necessary components of any solution. But measures like these don’t address the underlying cause of the water scarcity we face. One way or another, we need to figure out how to transfer water from one use to another more critical use in a reliable and consistent way so that users not involved in the trade are not damaged by it, and so both agricultural and urban users can plan and make investments with reasonable confidence in the volume of water they’ll be able to access – and the price they will have to pay to get it.\nThese problems are complex, but they are also solvable. Water management lies at the intersection of economic, legal, political, hydrological, climatological, ecological, agricultural, and engineered systems. It can be difficult for existing institutions to understand all of the disparate perspectives. But we can use the frameworks of complex systems to begin to analyze water supply and demand.\nInterdependency clearly plays a role in the systems we have and the systems we need to build, as does path dependence (in physics, a system whose state depends on the path taken to achieve it). The concept of scale helps us understand the spatial mismatch between the laws of physics that govern hydrology and the local, state, and federal laws that govern water allocation. Understanding the drivers and effects of institutional hysteresis (lag in response to forces) can help us break down impediments to better water supply systems. These are but a few examples of complex systems concepts that can help us think more deeply about water.\nIn turn, the knowledge that emerges from this deeper thinking can facilitate a broader understanding of the social and political tools that we already use to manage societal challenges. Further, the science-based solutions developed by applying a complex systems perspective to water management may also generalize to address many of the other intractable social and political challenges we face today: from addressing global poverty to mitigating climate change.\nEnjoy this article?

It’s a cosmos in which there are multiple universes. And by multiple, I mean an infinite number. These uncountable realms sit side by side in higher dimensions that our senses are incapable of perceiving directly.\nYet increasingly astronomers and cosmologists seem to be invoking the multiverse to explain puzzling observations.\nThe stakes are high. Each alternate universe carries its own different version of reality. There will be one where you wrote this column and I read it; one where the Guardian is an alt-right propaganda rag; even a really weird one in which Donald Trump uses twitter to spread nothing but amusing cat videos.\nIt sounds bonkers but the latest piece of evidence that could favour a multiverse comes from the UK’s Royal Astronomical Society. They recently published a study on the so-called ‘cold spot’. This is a particularly cool patch of space seen in the radiation produced by the formation of the Universe more than 13 billion years ago.\nThe cold spot was first glimpsed by NASA’s WMAP satellite in 2004, and then confirmed by ESA’s Planck mission in 2013. It is supremely puzzling. Most astronomers and cosmologists believe that it is highly unlikely to have been produced by the birth of the universe as it is mathematically difficult for the leading theory – which is called inflation – to explain.\nThis latest study claims to rule out a last-ditch prosaic explanation: that the cold spot is an optical illusion produced by a lack of intervening galaxies.\nOne of the study’s authors, Professor Tom Shanks of Durham University, told the RAS, “We can’t entirely rule out that the Spot is caused by an unlikely fluctuation explained by the standard [theory of the Big Bang]. But if that isn’t the answer, then there are more exotic explanations. Perhaps the most exciting of these is that the Cold Spot was caused by a collision between our universe and another bubble universe. If further, more detailed, analysis … proves this to be the case then the Cold Spot might be taken as the first evidence for the multiverse.”\nHeady stuff. But the irony is that if there is a multiverse, scientists will have to accept that the ultimate goal of physics – to explain why our universe is the way it is – could be forever out of reach.\nThe endgame for physics has been to provide the reason why our universe takes the form it does. To do this it must explain why certain fundamental quantities have the values they do. For example: the speed of light, the mass of an electron, the strength of the gravitational interaction.\nIf there is a multiverse, however, that quest could be doomed to failure.\nJust as there are an infinite number of similar yet slightly different universes (like the one in which you have written this column not me), there will also be an infinite number in which the basic laws of physics are different.\nSo, every possible combination of physics is tried out across the multiverse. Inevitably then, by nothing more than blind luck, at least one will have the conditions we see around us today. It’s just a big old accident, and that hardly seems very satisfying.\nOne of the most vocal opponents of the multiverse theory is – ironically – one of its original architects. Paul Steinhardt, Princeton University, helped develop inflation, the theory of the origin of our universe. It’s the one that struggles to explain the cold spot, whilst also giving rise to the multiverse because according to its maths once a universe starts to form it triggers more to be born ad infinitum.\nHowever, Steinhardt turned against his own theory.\nIn 2014, he told Scientific American magazine, “Our observable universe would be just one possibility out of a continuous spectrum of outcomes. So, we have not explained any feature of the universe by introducing inflation after all. We have just shifted the problem of the original big bang model (how can we explain our simple universe when there is a nearly infinite variety of possibilities that could emerge from the big bang?) to the inflationary model (how can we explain our simple universe when there is a nearly infinite variety of possibilities that could emerge in a multiverse?).”\nPut this way, a multiverse doesn’t sound attractive. It would cut to the very heart of physics’ purpose. Nature, of course, doesn’t care about this. Maybe the cosmos really is this way and we just have to accept it. Certainly, there are many who are willing to defend the multiverse as a valid direction for thought.\nComfortingly, if we do live in a multiverse, we can be assured that somewhere out there is an alternate version of you and me that have already figured all this out (and won a Nobel prize for the effort).\nStuart Clark is the author of The Unknown Universe (Head of Zeus).

But Hollywood’s usual portrayal of service members being physically and psychologically wounded is too narrow, says Charlie Ebersol, a Los Angeles-based TV and film producer. “It’s so staid and boring.”\nHaving on-screen veterans look like ordinary Americans, however, causes our views and politics will change, Ebersol believes. So along with Got Your 6 and support from the White House, he developed a certification system for films and television shows that “contain a representative and balanced depiction of veterans.” (Think: Chris Pratt playing a Navy veteran in the blockbuster Jurassic World, or the latest season of Dancing with the Stars, which featured an Army vet and double amputee doing the Tango.)\nNationSwell recently spoke to Ebersol by phone from Southern California about the role Hollywood should be playing in bridging the civilian-military divide.\nWhat misconceptions does traditional media perpetuate about veterans?\nThat they’re either heroes or they’re victims; they either need our help or they don’t need any help at all. It’s not binary, and the real story is so much more complex and interesting, in that, you have great opportunity in all these veterans coming home, but we don’t take advantage of it because we think they all have PTSD or hero syndrome.\nHow are you personally changing that narrative?\nIn keeping with Hollywood tradition, I operate from a philosophy that if you offer some sort of shiny prize or award to producers, they will do what they need to do to get said prize. So we’ve been certifying movies and television shows that do a good job telling veterans’ stories. Lo and behold, people started telling better veterans’ stories when they got a gold star at the end of their show or movie.\nShould filmmakers be meeting with veterans to turn their stories into films?\nIt’s literally that simple. The problem is that, for so long, we were trying to drum up support for the veterans coming home. To do that, people have always [done something similar] to those ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) commercials where the dogs look really pathetic and what’s her name — [Sarah] McLachlan — is playing her sad song. You may donate money, but what they found was the best way to get people to actually adopt dogs was to show how much fun and how fabulous these dogs were.\nAfter Word War II, veterans came back and people wanted to hire them because they were highly trained. They knew they did well under pressure, and some people started really reaching out. We don’t do that [today]. So when you look for a story, all you really have to do is talk to a veteran, say, “Thank you for your service. Can you tell me about interesting people that are in your lives or unique stories?” And the majority of the stories you’re going to hear are not going to be stories of, “oh, my buddy who’s got a massive drinking problem and is living on the street,” because that’s such a fraction of the population. A lot of the stories are going to be about guys who served two or three tours and now they run a hardware shop or now they’re working in a corporation or are in the tech business. Those stories make for interesting characters.\nIn telling these stories, what have you learned about what defines an American soldier?\nLoyalty, duty and commitment. As an employer, when I’m interviewing somebody, if I could know inherently those were a person’s three strongest traits, that would be the ultimate cheat sheet. That’s the beauty of hiring a veteran. You know going in that that person is loyal, feels a sense of duty and is all about commitment because the guy or girl put themselves in harm’s way for their country and for their fellow soldier or sailor or airman. That’s what you’re looking for in a company, in a family, in a friend. You want people that you know are going to show up, and nobody shows up like the military.\nWhat can the rest of us do to support veterans?\nThe platitude needs to stop being, “Thank you for your service,” and actualize that into something meaningful. The yellow ribbon and the stickers, that’s all well and good, but that’s not actually translating into anything. We have to look past that and ask, “How are we creating job opportunities? How are we creating community support where we’re embracing these people?” A lot of people want to do it under the guise of “They served our country, so we owe them.” That’s not what I’m saying. Don’t get me wrong: You do have to take into account that we enjoy our freedoms because of them. But I think the other side of it is significantly more important; they have show their true character and their true colors, and in showing us that and in being trained, at the absolute worst, they are certainly the best qualified people for almost any job.\nIt’s rare that the person I hire into my company is the most suited because they went to the right types of schools; it’s always about how they act under pressure and how they understand teamwork and the mission being bigger than the man or woman. Veterans are always significantly better at that than anyone else.\nMORE: Why Is It So Hard to Understand What It’s Like to Be a Veteran?"},{"url":"http://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/30/manchester-police-cordon-off-area-as-bomb-squad-investigates","title":"Manchester Police cordon off area as bomb squad investigates","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Police trying to unmask the network behind Abedi searched a property in Wigan, 20 miles northwest of Manchester and placed a security cordon around the neighborhood for several hours.","date":"","full_text":"Greater Manchester Police briefly asked the public to stay out of a neighborhood in the nearby town of Wigan on Tuesday as a bomb disposal unit searched for explosives — part of the investigation into the attack that hit an Ariana Grande concert.\nGrande, meanwhile, said she and other top stars — including Justin Bieber, Coldplay and Miley Cyrus — will perform at a benefit concert in Manchester on Sunday night, less than two weeks after bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 people at her Manchester Arena show.\nPolice trying to unmask the network behind Abedi searched a property in Wigan, 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Manchester and placed a security cordon around the neighborhood for several hours.\nBut London's Metropolitan Police said Tuesday that military support for the counter-terrorism operations is gradually being reduced now that the official threat level has been lowered from \"critical\" to \"severe.\"\nAssistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said \"military personnel will remain in readiness to support the police, should it be necessary.\"\nOfficials also said extra police staffing that had been added to protect public gatherings over the holiday weekend would be reduced.\nThe railway station next to Manchester Arena, which had been shut since the blast, reopened Tuesday, easing transport woes for residents.\nManchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling were among those who laid wreaths at Victoria Station, which also suffered damage in the concert blast.

Simply put, workers—particularly low wage workers and immigrants—are getting screwed by their employers. Employers are stealing from their employees’ paychecks, skimming off the top, stealing tips, withholding pay, shaving off hours, making illegal deductions, making people work extra hours for free…you name it. It’s called wage theft. And it’s illegal. For those individuals and families who are already struggling to make ends meet, wage theft can cripple them. And because wage theft is so underreported, the practice is more widespread than you would ever imagine.\nA number of high-profile cases have helped to bring attention to this growing epidemic. For example, last year 10,000 current and past Chipotle employees filed a class action lawsuit against the restaurant chain, alleging they were made to work off the clock for additional hours without compensation. According to the suit, “Chipotle routinely requires hourly-paid restaurant employees to punch out, and then continue working until they are given permission to leave.” This is the largest wage theft class action in history.\nBut Chipotle is not alone. Last year, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the U.S. Department of Labor announced a $500,000 agreement with a Papa John’s franchisee, whose three stores violated minimum wage and overtime laws, and took illegal deductions from 200 workers’ wages by failing to fully reimburse all work-related expenses. McDonald’s was on the hook for tens of millions of dollars a franchisee stole from 500 employees; the franchisee settled for $700,000. And in 2014 the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld a $187 million verdict by a Philadelphia jury on behalf of Wal-Mart employees who were owed lost wages from missed paid breaks and off-the-clock work.\nMeanwhile, several reports released in recent years have shed light on the scope of wage theft. A 2009 report by the National Employment Law Project and others—Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers: Violation of Employment and Labor Laws in America’s Cities—studied nearly 4,400 low-wage workers in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. The study found that 26 percent of workers had been paid below the minimum wage, while 76 percent of those who worked over 40 hours were not paid at the required time-and-a-half overtime rate. And 17 percent of the employees worked “off the clock” either before or after their shifts. Low-wage workers in these three cities lost an estimated $56.4 million each week, with the average worker losing $2,634 out of $17,616 in total earnings. The total wage theft from these three cities was close to $3 billion.\n“Employers do threaten calling immigration on their workers,” says Nadia Hewka, staff attorney at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia. “There are literally direct threats against my clients, when all they try to do is get their wages.”\nA 2014 report from the Economic Policy Institute estimated that wage theft costs workers more than $50 billion annually. “All of the robberies, burglaries, larcenies, and motor vehicle thefts in the nation cost their victims less than $14 billion in 2012, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports. That is well over one-third of the estimated cost of wage theft nationwide,” the report said.\nLocally, the Sheller Center for Social Justice at the Temple University Beasley School of Law issued a report in 2015 on wage theft in Pennsylvania. The report discussed the various types of wage theft, including minimum wage violations, overtime violations, illegal deductions from a worker’s paycheck, undercounting of hours worked, and delayed or missed payments. The authors estimate that in a given workweek, 397,673 low-wage Pennsylvania workers experience a minimum wage violation, while 326,647 workers experience an overtime violation, and 257,204 workers are not paid for off-the-clock work before and after their shift. In the five counties of the Philadelphia metropolitan area, those numbers are 128,476 minimum wage violations, 105,458 overtime violations, and 83,344 of-the-clock violations. These workers lose 15 percent of their earnings due to wage theft, leading their families to make tough decisions, “such as whether to forego purchasing food or face the consequences of unpaid bills for housing, utilities, and health care.”\nA sampling of occupations tells the real story. For example, an estimated 49 percent of beauty, dry cleaning and general repair workers and 66.3 percent of childcare workers in Pennsylvania are victims of minimum wage violations in a given week. In addition, 67.8 percent of cooks, dishwashers and food preparers and 86 percent of stock office clerks and couriers are denied overtime pay, and 72.5 percent of building services and grounds workers and 90.4 percent of home healthcare workers face off-the-clock wage violations.\nFurther, the report concluded that stolen wages deprive the state of tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue each year, and places law abiding businesses at a competitive disadvantage.\n“I think the hardest thing about the whole issue is we know that it happens frequently, but it is completely under reported for a huge variety of reasons,” says Jennifer J. Lee, assistant clinical professor of law at Temple University Beasley School of Law. Lee heads the Social Justice Lawyering Clinic at the Sheller Center, where she works with law students assisting low-income people, especially low-income workers and immigrants. “The underreporting happens because of fear of retaliation, that makes a lot of sense,” Lee noted, adding that while wage theft occurs across the spectrum, it is pronounced in lower paying jobs, as “people in tenuous low wage jobs don’t want to jeopardize their jobs because of balance of power issues. And if you’re someone who doesn’t have immigration status or has tenuous immigration status, it isn’t just being fired, but being deported.” Typically, some employers will seek out immigrant workers for exploitation, on the belief they will not complain about bad working conditions.\n“Clearly wage theft is a problem for people living paycheck to paycheck when you can’t pay your bills and your rent, and you’re struggling,” says Nadia Hewka, staff attorney at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia. “It appears wage theft is a bigger problem than all kinds of other theft and property crimes combined. It’s staggering when you think about it, because you know how many people get swept up in petty crimes, and we know it is unreported because we have situations where only one or two people step forward.”\nAccording to Hewka, the most common wage theft culprits include small mom and pop pizza places, small restaurants, green grocers and delis, home healthcare and childcare, and low wage, unregulated environments where there is no union in place and no one to monitor the employer’s activities.\nWage theft costs workers more than $50 billion annually. According to a 2014 study by the Economic Policy Institute, “all of the robberies, burglaries, larcenies, and motor vehicle thefts in the nation cost their victims less than $14 billion in 2012, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports. That is well over one-third of the estimated cost of wage theft nationwide.”\nAnother form of wage theft, Hewka notes, occurs when workers are misclassified as independent contractors, as is the case with 9 percent of Pennsylvania workers. Further, in the age of the “fissured workplace,” there is distance between workers and their employers. Temp agencies and subcontractors come in to insulate the employer, creating uncertainty as to who writes the paychecks and who takes ultimate responsibility for workplace health and safety, “and everyone leans on the guy above them when they’re not paid.” Lee noted a number of cases where employers unsuccessfully claimed their workers were independent contractors, including workers folding laundry in a laundromat, and employees on a construction site working as a subcontractor to a larger contractor.\nFortunately, there are solutions to wage theft. For example, the Sheller Center report recommended stronger penalties for employers; increasing funding to the Department of Licenses and Inspections (DLI) for enforcement of wage and hour laws; working with community groups to determine enforcement priorities, and the use of license revocations and wage liens for employers. Meanwhile, Philadelphia enacted a wage theft ordinance last year, allowing employees to file wage theft complaints with the City of Philadelphia’s Wage Theft Coordinator. Experts believe it is too soon to assess the implementation of the ordinance and its impact.\nHewka believes the enforcement of wage laws is important, but must be strategic and focus on certain industries where wage theft occurs. In addition, she says it is important for agencies to take anti-retaliation seriously. And she is concerned that under a Trump administration, immigrant workers will be concerned about coming forward. “Employers do threaten calling immigration on their workers. There are literally direct threats against my clients, when all they try to do is get their wages,” she says. Further, Hewka emphasizes the need to devote resources in other parts of the state for similarly situated workers.\n“We need a forum for workers to organize, more unionization of workers. Workers organizing more informally through workers’ centers,” Lee says. “That is crucial to overcoming that imbalance of power.” Lee adds that while enforcement is important, enforcement alone will not work, particularly if resources are limited. “We need to make consumers more aware of what is going on,” she noted, using the example of the Restaurant Opportunities Center (ROC) “High Road” Diner’s Guide to Ethical Eating, which highlights restaurants with the highest wage and labor standards. “People in Philadelphia are incredibly progressive, and if they know there is a list of restaurants that don’t pay their workers, they would respond.”\nHeader photo by Quinn Dombrowski on Flickr"},{"url":"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2017/04/payday-loan-customers-want-more-protections-access-to-lower-cost-credit-from-banks","title":"Payday Loan Customers Want More Protections, Access to Lower-Cost Credit From Banks","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Payday loans typically carry annual percentage rates of 300 to 500 percent and are due on the borrower’s next payday (roughly two weeks later) in lump-sum payments that consume about a third of the average customer’s paycheck, making the loans difficult to repay without borrowing again.

They are characterized by unaffordable payments, unreasonable loan terms, and unnecessarily high costs.\nIn June 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed a rule to govern payday and auto title loans1 that would establish a process for determining applicants’ ability to repay a loan but would not limit loan size, payment amount, cost, or other terms. The CFPB solicited and is reviewing public comments on whether to include in its final rule alternatives to this process with stronger safeguards, particularly a 5 percent payment option that would limit installment payments to 5 percent of monthly income, enabling banks and credit unions to issue loans at prices six times lower than those of payday lenders, making lower-cost credit available at scale. An analysis by The Pew Charitable Trusts determined that the CFPB’s proposal would accelerate a shift from lump-sum to installment lending but, without the 5 percent option, would shut banks and credit unions out of the market, missing an opportunity to save consumers billions of dollars a year.2\nPrevious Pew research found that payday loan borrowers want regulatory action to reform payday lending and expand lower-cost credit options, so in light of the CFPB proposal, Pew conducted a new nationally representative survey of 826 borrowers and found that:\n70 percent of borrowers believe payday loans should be more regulated.\nSupport for requiring installment payment structures is strong. Three in 4 borrowers say having several months to repay and doing so in smaller installments would be major improvements, but most say additional underwriting would not.\nBorrowers’ priorities for reform include lower prices, affordable payments, and being able to obtain small loans from banks and credit unions.\n8 in 10 would prefer to borrow from a bank or credit union if they were equally likely to be approved, and 90 percent would do so if the loans cost six times less than those of payday lenders. The pricing differential is based on payday lender fees for loans and on prices financial institutions would reportedly offer.\nVirtually all would choose loans that cost six times less. Ninety-two percent of borrowers say they would prefer the lower-cost credit that banks and credit unions would likely offer under the 5 percent payment option. Only 5 percent would opt for more expensive payday installment loans that went through the proposed ability-to-repay origination process.\nThese findings show that payday loan borrowers strongly favor reform and are especially supportive of steps that would encourage lower-cost bank and credit union loans. A separate survey of American adults found that the public shares these sentiments.3 This chartbook discusses recommended changes to the proposal, including adoption of the 5 percent option, which is supported by Pew as well as many banks, community groups, and credit unions.\nThose who cited multiple factors as “very important” were asked which was the most important. Thirty-nine percent chose “the fee charged”; 24 percent chose “how quickly you can get the money”; 21 percent chose “the certainty that you will be approved for the loan”; 11 percent chose “the loan amount”; and 6 percent chose “how easy it is to apply for the loan.”\nRoughly 12 million Americans use payday loans annually, spending an average of $520 in fees to repeatedly borrow $375.4\nIn 2010, Colorado enacted a successful payday lending reform that led to the closure of more than half of payday loan stores over the ensuing five years but also doubled the number of customers served at each remaining stzore. The state required prices to be roughly three times lower than before the law changed, and lenders responded with improved efficiency. As a result, credit remains widely available, but loan payments now consume an average of 4 percent of a borrower’s paycheck instead of the previous 38 percent. The reforms have saved Colorado borrowers more than $40 million annually.5\nEvery payday loan customer has a checking account at a bank or credit union because it is a loan requirement. Most customers would prefer borrowing from their bank or credit union instead of a payday lender as long as they were equally likely to be approved, but they cannot do so because regulatory uncertainty has made it difficult for banks and credit unions to issue small loans. Many financial institutions have expressed an interest in offering lower-cost, small-dollar credit to their customers who use payday loans, but only if they receive clear regulatory guidance that enables them to do so with simple underwriting.\nIn May 2016, American Banker reported that at least three large banks were planning to offer small loans, repayable in affordable installments, at prices that were roughly six times lower than those of average payday loans.6 Given the choice, most borrowers say they would use these lower-cost bank or credit union loans rather than payday loans. Financial institutions have stated that they would not be able to offer such loans under the CFPB’s proposed ability-to-repay (ATR) test but would under the 5 percent payment alternative. Several bank and credit union trade associations have asked the bureau to include the 5 percent payment option in the final rule.7\nIf borrowers of high-cost credit were able to access loans from banks and credit unions that cost six times less than those offered by payday lenders, Pew estimates they would save more than $10 billion annually, more than the United States spends on some major anti-poverty programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families basic assistance and Head Start.8 Borrowers reacted positively to the idea of banks and credit unions offering lower-cost small loans.\nWhen presented with possible components of the CFPB’s final regulation, borrowers said loans with lower prices, more affordable payments, and reasonable installment structures would be a major improvement, but most said a debt evaluation process or a limit on the number of installment loans they could use was “not an improvement” or only a “minor improvement.” The outcomes borrowers favored most were those that would probably result from the 5 percent payment option. The proposed rule relies heavily on a specific origination process that would make offering lower-cost installment loans at scale too difficult for banks and credit unions, but these institutions say they would be likely to offer such loans if the CFPB includes the 5 percent payment option in its final rule.\nUnder the CFPB’s proposed ATR provisions in which lenders would pull borrowers’ credit reports, use a real-time database, and have an estimate of similar people’s expenses, $1,250 and $500 loans, repayable in 10 and five months for $2,450 and $595 in fees, respectively, would probably continue to be offered. The bureau’s commentary on the proposed rule stated that most payday installment loan borrowers would pass an ATR test for monthly payments of more than $300, which is larger than the monthly payments for many payday installment loans and more than borrowers say they can afford.9\nBanks and credit unions could offer five-month loans of $500 for a $125 fee under a 5 percent payment option, which borrowers say compare favorably to the $500 loans with $750 fees that payday lenders would be likely to issue under the proposed ATR provision. Unless the proposed regulations are modified, high-cost loans are the only ones likely to be widely available.\nIf banks are allowed to issue loans under the 5 percent payment option using the borrower’s checking account history and income information for underwriting purposes, they will be likely to offer a three-month loan of $500 for $75 in fees. Most borrowers would choose this loan over a $500 loan with $450 in fees that payday lenders would be likely to issue under the proposed ATR provision.\nAdvocates of payday loans frequently point to the help that readily available, small-dollar credit provides to borrowers when financial difficulties arise. And although borrowers agree that credit can be beneficial, they say cost is a major factor in determining whether loans are helpful. Banks would be likely to offer loans of $400 for a fee of about $60 if the 5 percent payment option is included in the CFPB’s final rule, while payday lenders would charge fees of around $350 for the same $400 loan issued under the proposed longer-term ATR provision, meaning borrowers view the potential bank loans as far more helpful than payday installment loans. The bank loan with a $60 fee would have an APR of 88 percent, compared with an APR of 473 percent for the payday loan.\nConsumers are interested in obtaining loans through online banking and other channels. To keep costs down, banks would need to be able to issue loans using electronic and other automated methods that do not require staff time to process applications or disburse funds, but banks need clear standards to support such automation for lower-cost small-dollar loans. The ability to prescreen customers for eligibility, automate the origination process, and deposit proceeds immediately into checking accounts are the factors that would enable banks to profitably offer small loans at prices much lower than those of payday lenders.\nAs shown in Figure 9 on Page 11, 9 in 10 borrowers see a $35 fee for a $300, three-month loan as fair, but 3 in 4 believe it is unfair to charge the same amount for a checking account overdraft. Current regulation does not support borrower preferences because it permits such overdraft fees but does not enable banks to offer lower-cost small-dollar loans at scale.\nEmphasizing annual percentage rate information does little to dissuade borrowing, deterring only about 1 in 10 respondents: When APRs are featured prominently, 57 percent of payday loan borrowers say they would be likely to use such a loan if short on cash, compared with 68 percent when APR is not highlighted.\nMethodology\nOn behalf of The Pew Charitable Trusts, the GfK Group conducted a national study of 826 payday loan borrowers Aug. 23-28, 2016. The survey was conducted using KnowledgePanel, a probability-based web panel designed to be representative of the United States. The survey consisted of two stages: initial screening for borrowers and the main survey with the study-eligible respondents. To qualify for the main survey, a panel member must have used a payday loan (at a store or online).\nThe margin of error including the design effect is plus or minus 4 percent at the 95 percent confidence level.

The fabric helps block a large hole in the tiling coated with black mold.\n“This is over a year that I’ve asked for this to be done,” Johnson said. “All the tiles are coming loose.”\nJohnson, 73, has lived at Brookland Manor Apartment for 35 years. The 20-acre community of buildings on the northeast side of Washington is about 80 years old and in desperate need of redevelopment. Now there is a plan to do just that, but it’s raising questions for long-time residents like Johnson.\nJohnson lives with her twin son and daughter, both in their 40s, and two grandchildren in a four-bedroom apartment with a den. The planned redevelopment of the complex will transform Brookland Manor into a mixed-use, mixed-income community, with apartments and townhomes — but none are planned to have more than three bedrooms, and most will have one or two.\n“One of the things they told my daughter, they said, ‘Why don’t you move into a two-bedroom apartment, and your mom can go in a nursing home, and your brother can have his own place?’” Johnson said. “We’re not going to break up our family.”\nThe change makes financial sense from the perspective of the complex’s owner, Mid-City Financial Corp. “The smaller the unit size, the more people you can have there, the more money you can get per unit,” said Madi Ford, Mid-City’s director of legal affairs. “The smaller your units are, the more profitable they are.”\nMore units, less affordability\nThe lack of larger units isn’t the only change raising eyebrows among Brookland Manor residents. The complex is made up of 535 residential units, ranging in size from one bedroom to five. Nearly 70 percent of the apartments — 373 to be exact — are subsidized by the government for low-income renters. Other Brookland Manor residents hold “portable” subsidized housing vouchers that they can use at any complex that accepts them. Mid-City Financial has committed to keeping 373 of the units in the complex affordable after the reconstruction, but in a city with a critical shortage of affordable housing some residents argue that’s not enough — particularly since after the redevelopment, the complex will have 1,760 units. They say that a complex with triple the current number of units, should have more units for low-income residents as well.\nFord said her company is sensitive to the concerns of the current residents. The project will be built in phases, over a 10-year period and, according to Ford, no residents will be displaced during that time. Instead some families will shift to new units, like musical chairs, while the work is being completed.\n“We are relocating people onsite at our expense, prior to bringing buildings down,” Ford said. “Show me other private developers who are doing that.”\nAlthough D.C.’s department of housing and community development has no role in this particular project, director Polly Donaldson said the city is highly committed to providing affordable housing for families in need, even large families.\nShe said that in this case, Mid-City is following federal rules to accommodate families. According to Donaldson, D.C.’s rental housing stock is, and has always been primarily units of three bedrooms or less.\n“The fact is, it’s counter-indicated by the Census data,” Donaldson said. “Yes, of course, there are examples of larger families, but I think that’s not really what the average is and what our public policy is shaped toward in that way.”\nBut Johnson, 73, who has lived in her large apartment raising her family for more than 35 years, thinks the city should respond to the needs of all, not just the average.\n“These places are really falling down around us, and I think everyone likes something new. Everyone. But we just don’t want to be pushed aside,” Johnson said."},{"url":"https://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2017/05/26/tabitha-soren-captures-the-other-side-of-baseball-in-new-book","title":"Tabitha Soren Captures the Other Side of Baseball in New Book","author_text":null,"keywords":["Audio"],"publication_text":"KQED Arts","description":"The former MTV News Reporter has been a fine arts photographer for almost 15 years and her newest book, 'Fantasy Life,' takes a new perspective on sports","date":"","full_text":"During her eight years with MTV News, Tabitha Soren brought journalistic gravitas to a network that focused on celebrity and drama.

Though she wasn’t a fan of baseball at the time, seeing the team’s new recruits inspired her to start a massive project.\n“I met a draft class who was arriving at Spring Training for the very first time,” Soren said. “And I saw all these kids with their faces full of hope, all going to work towards playing on a major league team, and I thought, ‘Wow, wouldn’t this be great to shoot their picture every year and see how their faces change, because they can’t remain this hopeful.'”\nThat idea, born 14 years ago, comes to fruition with her newest book of photographs, Fantasy Life. Her idea of chronicling the players losing faith in the game didn’t pan out; the changes weren’t as visual as she hoped. But what Soren did find was a whole other world built around what she once thought was America’s most boring pastime.\n“Even the guys in the dugout, they looked so bored in half of my pictures, making sculptures out of peanut shells or tobacco cans,” Soren said. “You know, the things that go on in there are not scintillating.”\nBut Soren found a way to bring out the more artistic qualities of the game. She experimented with tintype, a technology first developed in the 1860s. It made for beautiful images that, unlike other sports photographs, didn’t depend on action or celebrity. Fantasy Life collects the best of those tintypes as well as an assortment of other photos she took at games — both major and minor league — all over the state.\nFor baseball fans, Fantasy Life provides a look at star players you won’t get from ESPN, and that’s thanks to Billy Beane, the executive vice president of baseball operations for the Oakland A’s, who gave Soren complete access to the team during her 14-year project. Beane said he’s not much of an art fan, but that there was plenty for him to appreciate in Soren’s photographs.\n“When I was able to look back at her exhibition, and knowing all the time she put into it — I’m going “God, she’s putting a lot of time into it this. What are going to be the results?” But looking back at it now, it sort of acts as a time capsule,” Beane said.\nRead more about Soren’s baseball photos in our previous story. Nearly 200 photos from Fantasy Life will be on display at San Francisco City Hall from July 20–Dec. 15, 2017, across two floors — including many players from the San Francisco Giants — and admission is free."},{"url":"http://www.wnyc.org/story/la-morada-intersection-old-and-new-mott-haven","title":"La Morada: At the Intersection of the Old and New Mott Haven","author_text":null,"keywords":["Npr","New York","Wnyc","Arts","Culture","News","Public","Radio"],"publication_text":"WNYC","description":"Undocumented immigrants run this Oaxacan restaurant, where questions of affordability and gentrification are on the front burner.","date":"","full_text":"WNYC is taking a close look at New York City’s affordability crisis, one neighborhood at a time. We’re starting in Mott Haven in the South Bronx. It’s an area that’s struggled for decades with poverty and crime. But now it’s gentrifying, and that’s creating new opportunities and pressures in the community. At La Morada, a Oaxcan restaurant on Wills Avenue, those issues are on the front burner.\nNatalia Mendez and her husband Antonio Saavedra were farm workers in a small town in Oaxaca, Mexico before they moved to New York in the early '1990s, undocumented and looking for a better life. Their older kids, Claudia and Marco, crossed the border as toddlers; their youngest, Carolina was born here. They opened their restaurant — which they run and pay taxes for — through an LLC.\nCritics have raved about the food, including its six kinds of mole, and the restaurant is a hub for the community. But the community at La Morada, like Mott Haven in general, is changing. Fancy residential towers are coming to the waterfront, new people are moving into the neighborhood, and longtime residents with rising rents are leaving.\nMarco Saavedra is the restaurant's head waiter and the family's lead activist. He's a member of the Dream 9, a group of undocumented youth who crossed the border from Mexico in 2013 to request asylum. His case is up for a hearing next year. He says the influx of new customers at La Morada means business is better than ever. But he's conflicted about what the changes mean for the community.\n\"We were initially displaced from Oaxaca, Mexico because we couldn’t find a livelihood there. And so we had to immigrate here to New York City and travel without papers,\" he said. \"We know it’s a heartbreak when you can no longer either find a source of living or afford where you used to live and so we don’t want to replicate that to someone else.\"\nMeanwhile, the family is concerned about its own fate. Now that rents are spiking all around them, they're worried they may not be able to hang on to their space much longer.\n\"We know that some landlords will seize this opportunity to bump up prices and people will be priced out,\" Marco Saavedra said.\nWe want to hear from you.

On the macro issues—the future of the European Union, the fate of open borders and open trade, a celebration of cultural diversity—Macron took clear and courageous stands. As Macron now turns to establishing a working coalition in Parliament in the June elections, he must also begin to deal with the metro issues that have emerged as flash points in France, England, the United States and elsewhere.\nThree sets of issues—and three separate constituencies—will demand attention.\n1) The economic anxiety and anger of forgotten people living in left-behind places.\nLe Pen drew a good portion of her support from cities like Calais and small communes like Hayange, former industrial communities in France’s northern Rust Belt that have failed to find a new raison d'etre in the rapidly changing global economy. High poverty and unemployment has helped trigger deep resentment of France’s growing diversity. Macron’s victory in communities with over 10 percent unemployment shrunk to 15 percentage points, about half his national cushion. Similar dynamics were true with the election of Trump (think Erie, Pennsylvania) or Brexit (think Sunderland).\n2) The growth of segregated immigrant enclaves in the suburbs of major cities such as Paris and Lyon.\nThese communities exist almost as parallel societies, isolated from educational and employment opportunities and characterized by insulated projects that house high concentrations of poor and disaffected populations. The anti-Islam fear stoked by Le Pen is abhorrent, and it doesn’t reflect the nation’s actual demographics or rate of immigration: Even after recent migration, France’s Muslim population is projected to only grow to 8.3 percent by 2020. But the economic and political disconnection of the banlieues is real: In the latest sign, voter absention in Siene-Saint-Denis, a district north of Paris that has the country’s highest immigrant population, was 32 percent, nearly 8 points above the national average.\n3) The preferences of places with secure positions in the new global order.\nMacron won nearly 90 percent of the vote in cosmopolitan Paris. Here, the issues facing national and city leaders will feel familiar to residents living in a prosperous metropolis like New York or London—the lack of affordable housing, the burdens imposed by traffic congestion and long commutes, and the existential crisis of climate change.\nThese metro challenges will require smart national policies and an even smarter partnership between the national government, cities and metropolitan areas. The good news: France has several examples of metro success to draw from, starting with the successful revival of Lyon, the third-largest city in France after Paris and Marseille.\nI visited Lyon twice last year at the invitation of Mayor Gerard Collomb. He has been mayor of the city since 2001 and has been a prominent supporter of Macron since the inception of his political movement, En Marche, and the announcement of his presidential candidacy. Macron recently named him interior minister, reflecting their mutual appreciation.\nThe good news: France has several examples of metro success to draw from, starting with the successful revival of Lyon.\nDuring his 16-year tenure, Mayor Collomb has engineered several remarkable structural reforms. He has been the catalyst behind the revitalization of Lyon Confluence, one of the largest urban renewal projects in Europe, located where the Rhône and Saône rivers meet. The secret to success: the establishment of a quasi-public, single-purpose development corporation similar to the entities responsible for the revival of the cores of Copenhagen and Hamburg.\nLyon Confluence is not just a real estate play; the hub of Lyon’s life sciences industry sits a stone’s throw from the district. One player in the hub: Lyon’s BIOASTER Technological Research Institute (TRI), which researches microbiology challenges through collaborations that include academics, start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises, and industrial groups.\nFinally, since January, 2015, Collomb has been the mayor not only of the city of Lyon but the President of the Metropole of Grand Lyon. This new metropolitan level government combines the city of Lyon with 58 suburban communes for purposes of conducting land use planning at the metropolitan scale, as well as carrying out business-attraction strategies. Lyon’s evolution as a Metropole should allow the thriving city center to have spillover benefits to surrounding “left behind” communities, rather than pitting adjacent jurisdictions against each other.\nMayor Collomb, in short, has engineered a distinctive model of governance that has the right scale, the right competencies, and the right mix of public sector vision and legitimacy and private sector discipline and entrepreneurism. The Lyon model doesn’t provide all the answers to France’s metro challenges. But there are discrete policies and practices that can be adapted by other cities and metropolitan communities to revitalize distressed areas, grow innovation ecosystems and districts, and promote smart and sustainable growth.\nPresident Macron’s victory has been rightly celebrated by stakeholders dependent on macro policy. But a focus on the complex economic, social, and environmental issues facing France’s cities and metropolitan areas is equally important.\nOne personal note. I met Macron at a gathering in Lyon hosted by Mayor Collomb last September. We talked about the Lyon Confluence effort as a possible model that might inform not just France but Europe, the United States, and beyond. Macron came across as smart, pragmatic and intellectually curious—the qualities all nations might hope for in a leader. We may find that the next burst of local/national collaborations have a distinctly French flavor."},{"url":"https://theconversation.com/the-song-that-had-one-british-politician-wishing-for-the-sex-pistols-sudden-death-77767","title":"The song that had one British politician wishing for the Sex Pistols' 'sudden death'","author_text":"Karen Fournier","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Conversation","description":"Banned from the BBC, denied its rightful place on the charts, 'God Save the Queen' – released 40 years ago this month – remains one of the most controversial protest songs of all time.","date":"","full_text":"Since punk rock’s earliest days, the genre has sought to challenge social norms and traditions.\nBut when the Sex Pistols came out with “God Save the Queen” 40 years ago, on May 27, 1977, it was instantly greeted with widespread, visceral condemnation.\nReleased only months after the band’s infamous and expletive-laden television debut on the Bill Grundy show in December 1976, many viewed the song as an all-out assault on the morals and values of British culture. Others saw it as an attack on civilization itself. London Councilor Bernard Brook Partridge described the song’s creators as “the antithesis of humankind” and wished for their “sudden death.”\nWhat made “God Save the Queen” so much more menacing in the eyes of its critics than any other punk song released in 1977? Why did the BBC bar it from radio airplay? And why was it denied its rightful place at the top of the U.K. Singles chart despite outselling the number-one hit of the time, Rod Stewart’s “I Don’t Wanna Talk About It”?\nMany think the song was denounced because it distilled punk’s key complaints into a single, targeted hit against British civic and political life, which was embodied by the royal family. Originally entitled “No Future,” the song ended up changing its name to “God Save the Queen,” an appropriation of the British national anthem. The Pistols’ version was an “anti-anthem,” a critique of Queen Elizabeth II, whose Silver Jubilee – a celebration to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her ascension to the throne – happened to coincide with the year of the song’s release.\nThe artwork that accompanies the song depicts defaced images of her Jubilee portrait and torn pieces of the Union Jack and Royal Stewart tartan. The lyrics, meanwhile, reflect the state of an empire that seemed to be imploding during the economic downturn of the mid-1970s:\n    Oh when there's no future\n    How can there be sin\n    We're the flowers\n    In the dustbin\n    We're the poison\n    In your human machine\n    We're the future\n    Your future!\nTaken together with its visuals, the song rings like a dire warning about the waning fortunes of the post-colonial British Empire at the very moment that it was celebrating its queen.\nRecent scholarly interest in the intersection of punk and religion gives a more nuanced reading of the song’s title and lyrics. According to punk scholar Mark Johnson, where the British national anthem asks God to watch over the queen as she executes her duties, the Pistols’ version conflates the queen and the church over which she presides.\nJohnson argues that the song’s central message is that “if there really is no future, and thus no future judgment, then how can there be sin for there is no penalty?”\nThe phrase “no future” – repeated 15 times during the song – becomes a call to arms against any authority that promises salvation in exchange for obedience.\nThe song found a visual counterpart in the punk fashion designer Vivienne Westwood’s DESTROY T-shirt, which infamously featured an upended crucifix superimposed on the Nazi swastika. Film clips of the band’s live performances and many photos from the period associate Rotten with the T-shirt.\nUnlike other punk songs of its time, “God Save the Queen” attracted criticism because it mixed signifiers of British pride and patriotism with one of the most reviled symbols in the world: the swastika. But for those who lived in London’s crumbling, impoverished neighborhoods during the 1970s, the “victory” against the Nazis seemed like a myth. If winning the war promised a better future, British youth were still waiting. And as the song alleges, Nazism was simply replaced by a “fascist regime” intent on keeping the poor in their place by denying them educational opportunities and meaningful employment. It also overlaid this political critique with a sharp stab at the Church of England, which the band viewed as complicit in the subjugation of those it was supposed to help.\nWhere other punk songs only hinted at the source of the economic and social problems in the U.K. in the mid-1970s, the Pistols were prepared to name their enemy. Until “God Save the Queen,” no punk band had pointed directly at the queen or the church as the source of all societal ills. And this is what made them sinners – and even treasonous – to the band’s critics.\nJohn (“Rotten”) Lydon has since explained that the song was a counterattack against these critics:\n“There we have it. More sinned against than sinning, don’t you think? I’d like to sum up with what my real opinion of censorship is, but quite frankly, I’d be censored for it. So I’ll let you guess the rest.”\n“God Save the Queen” can be located in a rich history of protest songs. Stretching back to genres like folk and soul, it’s most prevalent today in genres like rap. What these songs hold in common is a willingness to speak truth to power. And with many angry over Donald Trump’s election in America, we’ve already seen at least one artist, the rapper YG, use the blunt, in-your-face style of the Sex Pistols with his song “FDT” (“F— Donald Trump”)."},{"url":"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/uber-update-public-transit-info","title":"Uber to Start Offering Riders Real-Time Public Transit Info","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Company touts connectivity boost. ","date":"","full_text":"Ride-hailing apps may be taking riders away from public transit, but they’re also beginning to establish partnerships to address the notorious first/last mile issue. Uber is claiming that a new upgrade to its app falls into the latter camp, making it “easier for riders to combine Uber with public transit,” according to the company’s website.\nThe new feature is available on Android in partnership with Transit, and it shows departure times for trains and buses near wherever a rider is being dropped off. It’s available in a select number of U.S. cities including Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and the Bay Area, among others (you can see a full list here).\nUber is pitching the app as a way to better connect cities “where people can easily access all neighborhoods, including areas underserved by transit”; provide alternatives to personal car ownership and reduce traffic and parking because “public transit and carpooling can mean fewer cars on the road and less congestion.”\nSome, including Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge, are skeptical of the company’s pitch, however.\n“Promoting public transit is great, but this feature is mostly designed for people who are already headed to a bus or train — and it seems to be most useful for making sure they hurry to the stop so they don’t miss a nearing departure,” Kastrenakes wrote. “Please, don’t yell at your driver to speed up.”\nRegardless, several other — and likely more substantial — moves to partner ride-hailing apps with public transit have been made recently. As Josh Cohen wrote for Next City last year, “in an effort to encourage transit ridership and alleviate the impact of service cuts brought on by budget woes,” the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority of St. Petersburg, Florida, subsidized 50 percent of the cost of taking rides with Uber, United Taxi (a local cab company) or Care Ride (a paratransit service) if those rides were connecting to the bus for part of 2016.\nLyft has also worked to bridge the first mile/last mile gap by partnering with a technology company to reach people who “aren’t close enough to a transit station to walk there, but who may just take the train if they could press a button on an app to hail a quick ride to or from that station,” Jen Kinney wrote for Next City in 2016.​\nRachel Dovey is an award-winning freelance writer and former USC Annenberg fellow living at the northern tip of California’s Bay Area.

Truthfully, at least when it comes to poor children, the state has never been especially kind or helpful to them.\nRight now, the news is about as bad as it has been, though. Recent U.S. Census Bureau data show that Mississippi is bucking the trend of poverty falling around the country—in fact, our child poverty has gone up. A full one-third of our kids exist beneath the poverty line.\nThat means that they do not have the same access to secure housing, opportunities, healthy food, transportation, quality education and safe neighborhoods that wealthier families and communities enjoy. They cannot afford the same afterschool and summer arts and sports programs that their well-to-do counterparts can. They cannot escape dangerous neighborhoods where cycles of hopelessness and bad policing strategies make them more likely to become criminals at some point themselves.\nThe deck is stacked against them.\nNow, though, programs that can help them clear hurdles and actually find bootstraps to pull up on are in trouble—through mismanagement, the greed of elected officials who value tax cuts for the rich over opportunities for the poor, and the lack of attention to detail and strategy that could help the Mississippians who need it the most.\nThe State of Mississippi mismanaged federal money that has results in massive cuts to afterschool programs that help young people overcome circumstances and keep them busy in the most crime-prone time of day for minors. That means that proven programs such as Operation Shoestring are in trouble—hurting kids and causing job loss and income loss for the good people running them.\nDue to the misuse of federal funds, adolescent opportunity programs have closed or are now scrambling to find the funding to continue. AOPs and after-school programs are critical, not just to keep kids in school and out of the juvenile-justice system but also to encourage the next generation of Mississippians to chase their dreams, get an education, find jobs and build the future of the state.\nHere in Jackson, we just learned that the Greater Jackson Arts Council's city money was cut without notice.

And even though the FDA touted the delay as a way to reduce costs and increase flexibility for businesses, the change did not come early enough to save these companies any money. Many had already spent millions of dollars printing and shipping new menus to thousands of locations across the country so they would be ready for the original May 5 deadline.\n\"We were very shocked and discouraged,\" said Sara Burnett, director of food policy and wellness at Panera, which has been voluntarily posting calories on its menus since 2010.\n\"We've had plenty of time for organizations to figure out how to do this either on your own, or strictly in compliance with the federal legislation,” said Burnett, noting that FDA and the industry have been working on menu labeling for seven years. “We've all had plenty of time to prepare.\"\nNow what’s left is a hodgepodge of inconsistent menu labeling that’s confusing for consumers as each chain had to make a last-minute decision about whether to go ahead with their plans to post calories. Case in point: The $45 billion pizza industry. At California Pizza Kitchen, a sit-down restaurant, calories are now listed for each slice of pie, right next to the price. Over at Domino’s, if you order online, as most people do, you won't see any calorie counts until you get to checkout. At Pizza Hut? They label calories in at least some of their stores, but those numbers don't show up when you order online.\nThe delay also re-opens the rifts between different parts of the food industry over how stringent the rules should be. The restaurant industry itself — the second-largest employer in the country — actually lobbied alongside consumer advocates for the federal labeling mandate as a way to fix to the messy and expensive patchwork of state and local laws that had cropped up at the behest of health advocates across the country. Meanwhile, the grocery, convenience store and pizza lobbies have been pushing back, seeking less-strict requirements.\nFormer President Barack Obama’s FDA started writing the rule after the calorie-labeling mandate was tucked into the Affordable Care Act in 2010. But even during the Obama administration, which supported the rules as a way to help tackle the country’s crippling obesity epidemic, the requirement faced repeated delays under industry pressure. The rule that the FDA originally proposed in 2011 and finalized in 2014 requires chains with 20 or more locations to list calories on all menus so they are visible when a consumer is ordering. The Obama administration took a broad view of what should be covered under the rule, making sure to include movie theaters and alcohol.\nBut in the midst of the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory push, the rule was quickly swept aside.\n\"Under President Trump, our department will focus on promoting public health in ways that work for American consumers,” said HHS Secretary Tom Price, in a statement praising FDA’s decision. “Toward that end, the FDA is asking for feedback about how to make the Menu Labeling Rule more flexible and less burdensome while still providing useful information to consumers. We look forward to working with all involved to find the right balance.\"\nThe FDA pushed the deadline for the rule back a full year, to May 2018, but it could be longer if the agency makes substantial changes to the rule, which now appears likely.\nBehind the scenes, restaurant leaders are irate about the 11th-hour change, but they are reluctant to speak out against the FDA or the Trump administration.\nThe National Restaurant Association, though a spokesperson, declined to be interviewed for this story, instead pointing to a statement the group made right after FDA announced the change.\n“This delay upends plans that have been in motion for years throughout the food industry,” said Cicely Simpson, executive vice president for government affairs at NRA. “We will continue to strongly advocate on behalf of what is best for small businesses and American consumers.”\nThe grocery, convenience and pizza industries, however, see the delay as a chance to end up with less-stringent rules, even though many of them have already started posting calorie counts. For years, retailers, including the National Grocers Association, the Food Marketing Institute and the National Association of Convenience Stores and major pizza makers, represented by the American Pizza Community, tried to largely get out of menu labeling, arguing that it was unfair and burdensome.\nAfter a bitter, yearslong war with the National Restaurant Association, which fought to keep all businesses selling prepared foods in the rule so its competitors wouldn’t get a pass, the grocery and convenience lobbies dropped their bid to be exempt. But they are still pressing Congress to take up legislation that relaxes the rules, provides sweeping protection from litigation, and gives companies doing mostly take-out and delivery orders (read: pizza chains) a pass on having to post calories on their in-store menus. The House version of the legislation, sponsored by GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, passed last February, but a companion bill sponsored by Sen. Roy Blunt, hasn’t gotten traction.\nMeanwhile, a POLITICO review of more than 40 companies finds that most large chain restaurants, grocery and some convenience stores are prominently displaying calories on their menus despite the reprieve from Trump, but the extent to which they’re labeling is all over the map.\nEven many grocery and convenience leaders went ahead and started labeling anyway, though there are gaps in what’s being disclosed voluntarily. At a Giant in Alexandria, nearly all prepared foods were labeled during a recent visit, down to the croutons and dried cranberries in the salad bar, except for the store’s hot food items, like fried chicken and macaroni and cheese. A block away, a Shopper’s was found to be labeling only its hot food and not the rest of its prepared foods. At Whole Foods, nearly everything is labeled, except for the olive bar. In the coffee stand there, most drinks are labeled except for juices.\nLess than a mile from the Capitol, 7-Eleven is posting calories for all its prepared foods, down to the individual donut. A pizza slice there will set you back between 560 and 620 calories, the menu says, and you can get two slices for $2. Sheetz, a popular gas station/fast casual restaurant, said it’s in the process of testing calorie counts at some stores.\n“While many folks have gone forward and have no intent to go back, these fixes still need to be made,” said Rob Rosado, director of government relations for the Food Marketing Institute, which represents large grocers like Walmart and Kroger.\nRosado said he wants to see Congress pass legislation that walks back some of the prescriptiveness of the rule, giving retailers more flexibility to post calories on a nearby placard, for example, instead of next to each item in the prepared food bar. He also argued that FDA needs to do a better job of explaining to companies how they can comply with menu labeling.\n“It would be great if they would just provide some clarification,” Rosado said.\nThe majority of chain restaurants reviewed by POLITICO are also labeling their calories voluntarily. At Taco Bell, for example, a customer can now see clearly that the Fiesta Taco Salad there contains more calories (760) than the Crunchwrap Supreme (530). Over at IHOP, a calorie-conscious consumer might want to go with the red velvet pancakes (410-690) and steer clear of the cheeseburger omelet (1,450).\nThere was also a fair amount of inconsistency. At one Shake Shack in Virginia, calories were posted on a menu outside the store, but there were no calories listed on the main menu inside. At a nearby Popeyes, the menu didn’t list calories at all, but they could be found on some promo materials.\nConsumer advocates, who have pressed for more than a decade to get more disclosure in the hopes that it will help consumers make healthier choices, are livid.\nMargo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said she thinks that menu labeling, even though it’s mostly supported by industry, got swept up into Trump’s larger deregulatory push.\n“It was just irresistible to this anti-regulation administration ... even if it hurts business” she said.\n“I think that’s why the restaurants got screwed, while the convenience stores and supermarkets got what they wanted.”\nLast week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the city was going to start enforcing menu labeling despite FDA’s move, prompting fears that the restaurant industry was about to find itself back where it started seven years ago.\nCSPI is now urging other cities and states to move ahead.\n“I think other states and localities are going to once again look to New York City as a leader on this and go ahead and enforce menu labeling,” said Wootan. “They’re tired of waiting. Consumers have waited long enough.”"},{"url":"https://www.devex.com/news/how-to-include-a-randomized-controlled-trial-in-your-project-proposal-90388","title":"How to include a randomized controlled trial in your project proposal","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Devex","description":"Randomized controlled trials, or RCTs, can be an effective way of determining the true impact of interventions.

Much later, Kiausas learned what might have been behind the punch. “There was a lot of trauma happening at home [for the student],” she wrote in an email. “But we were not aware of these issues until months later, after the student was placed in another classroom.”\nIncidents like this — and the progression of disciplinary steps that culminated in removing the child from school without addressing underlying problems at home — have prompted Philadelphia and districts across the country to take a hard look at student discipline. So far, Philadelphia has banned suspensions of kindergarteners and hopes to do the same for first and second grade students soon. Other districts around the country and even entire states, such as Connecticut, are also banning suspensions and expulsions in the early grades, a practice that research shows disproportionately affects black and Hispanic boys and neglects to take into account other crucial issues impacting a child, such as trauma at home.\nRelated: Do ‘zero tolerance’ school discipline policies go too far?\nLast school year, the School District of Philadelphia suspended 5,667 children under the age of 10, including kindergarteners through third graders. Of the district’s 134,041 students, 50 percent are black and 20 percent Hispanic.\nAcknowledging the long-term harmful impact of kicking young children out of school, the district revised its Student Code of Conduct last summer to ban suspending kindergarteners unless their actions resulted in serious bodily injury. Since then, however, some say the needle hasn’t moved much. “It’s fair to say that young kids are still suspended in Philadelphia in violation of the policy,” said Harold Jordan, senior policy advocate for the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania. “The district administrators have not come through with implementing the new policy, even when it comes to kindergarten.”\nNot so, said Karyn T. Lynch, the district’s chief of student support services. “We’re projecting that we’ll see substantial differences this year [in the number of kindergarten suspensions] compared to last year. In general, we’re encouraged, we think we’re moving in the right direction,” Lynch said. “It’s important to see this in context of the work that’s been done in advance of this recommendation. It was not a decision we made easily, or without having the necessary climate and framework in place.”\nRelated: Can a California charter chain ditch tough discipline and retain its high ranking?\nAcross the country, disciplining children by kicking them out of school, referred to as exclusionary discipline, affects kids as young as 3 years old. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Education reported 5,000 preschoolers were suspended at least once, and 2,500 preschoolers were suspended more than once.\nResearch shows that when young children, many of whom are still learning classroom coping skills, are pushed out of school early and repeatedly, the impact can be irreversibly damaging. According to a Department of Education policy statement, children suspended in the early school years are 10 times more likely to drop out of high school, experience academic failure and grade retention, hold negative attitudes about school and face incarceration, than those who are not.\nPhiladelphia’s ban on kindergarten suspension is a positive step, said the ACLU’s Jordan, though he noted that it remains a work in progress. Overall, however, he said he has seen “a lot of good things happening in the district,” including the district’s focus on reducing exclusionary discipline in middle and high school. “In the later grades, I think we did not lag behind the rest of the country [in changing disciplinary policy]. But we are late to the game when it comes to talking about, much less addressing on a policy front, early childhood exclusion.”\nThe most comprehensive effort to eliminate exclusionary discipline for young children is unfolding in Connecticut. In 2015, the state passed legislation banning the suspension of children from preschool through second grade unless it is first determined at a hearing that the child’s behavior is of a violent or sexual nature that endangers others. “In Connecticut, they didn’t just pass a law; they passed a very nuanced and detailed law,” said Jordan. “It’s comprehensive and savvy with a lot of safeguards, much more detailed than what districts usually do.” Another distinguishing characteristic of Connecticut’s effort is that the state provides supports to its school districts, and to the agencies that are expected to support them in implementing the policy, rather than relying on individual school districts to organize and fund the supports needed.\nConnecticut’s Department of Education reports that preschool through second-grade suspensions and expulsions dropped by nearly one third since the 2014-15 school year — from 2,365 children then, to 1,674 last school year.\nOne Connecticut elementary school in which suspensions have dropped into the single-digits is the Robert J. O’Brien STEM Academy in East Hartford. O’Brien is classified as a high-poverty elementary school, with just over 60 percent of its students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Approximately 50 percent of its students are Hispanic, 36 percent are African American, and less than 10 percent are white. Five years ago, O’Brien reported 194 suspensions, including nearly 32 kindergarten suspensions. This year, with one month left before summer break, the school had just six suspensions, none of which involved kindergarteners.\nThis sea change in discipline came about via a transformative cocktail of state-allocated money, district guidance, staff training and time. “We didn’t exactly have a zero tolerance policy at the time, but the expectations for school staff was that if kids did certain things, they would simply be suspended,” said O’Brien Principal Lesley Morgan-Thompson. “So for us it was all about changing that approach. This took multiple years.”\nThe school’s turnaround began in the fall of 2014 when O’Brien joined the Commissioner’s Network, a state-sponsored rescue program serving 21 of Connecticut’s lowest-performing schools. As a result, O’Brien received $473,000 the first year, $550,000 the next year, and $410,000 this year to address its high levels of exclusionary discipline and other issues such as chronic absenteeism, low math and reading test scores, and limited family engagement.\nTo begin the process of reversing the school’s suspension rate, Morgan-Thompson knew her teachers needed stronger classroom management skills. Following guidance from the district, she immediately enrolled her teachers in training that would help them gain control of their classrooms. To get ready to help students in dire need of support, teachers took a summer course in Life Space Crisis Intervention, a program that trains educators to turn crisis situations into learning opportunities. “We honestly just didn’t have the skills to help our most impacted children,” said Morgan-Thompson.\nIn spite of these interventions, many teachers at the school still viewed suspensions as a valuable disciplinary tool and questioned their ability to keep students under control without it. That dilemma is at the heart of what critics maintain is an argument against banning suspensions: If children aren’t firmly disciplined, how will teachers control the classroom learning environment?\nBanning suspensions in the early grades is not about eliminating interventions, says the ACLU’s Jordan. Instead, it is about training school principals, and teachers, to use alternative methods for handling difficult situations. First, he said, school staff must be able to figure out the root cause of the problem, then they can work together to map out a reasonable solution. “Sometimes this comes down to more effective classroom management,” he said. “Other times, you’re dealing with a child who is traumatized by something that is happening outside of school, which requires a different response. In some situations, you will find that teachers push to remove kids from school based on their own stereotypes.”\nIn spite of all the training teachers received, Morgan-Thompson said a midyear audit two years ago revealed that just one third of teachers rated student behavior at O’Brien as under control in classes and common spaces. “At that point, they felt behaviors were bad and they had very few options to deal with them. We were working hard to reduce suspensions, so there were just very few options for what they could do to deal with disruptive behavior,” said Morgan-Thompson. “Teachers need to be able to teach, students need to be able to learn and teachers didn’t feel that was happening.”\nThat’s when she began asking her staff to enroll in district-offered climate and restorative practice training. “This was about giving teachers tools to know how to work with kids, emphasizing that relationships are at the core of what makes climate work,” said Morgan-Thompson. “It was about making a school welcoming, so that kids know that when they come here, the adults care about them, know about them, and have their best interest at heart. Kids need to know we’re not looking to punish them, but to help them learn how to do what they need to do.”\nOn the latest midyear audit, said Morgan-Thompson, 73 percent of O’Brien teachers rated student behavior as under control.\nUnderlying any discussion about school culture at O’Brien is the reality that, in stark contrast to its students, 80 percent of the school’s teachers are white. Physical education and health teacher Stephen Higgins, who has taught at O’Brien since 1999, is no stranger to how a racial disconnect between students and teachers may impact children. A native of East Hartford, he recalled being one of two African American students in his elementary school, an experience that forced him to constantly, “adapt who I was because no one looked or sounded like me. There really wasn’t anything in my life outside of home — from the curriculum, the teachers, most of the things we were doing — that represented me in my own life.”\nToday, Higgins said the process for handling a student in trouble is entirely different from just a few years ago. “Now we think about what are the problems surrounding this: Is it an issue of independence, an issue of mastery, is this child missing a sense of belonging?” Teachers then consult an intervention book to find an appropriate intervention. “We take in the whole child and when we try an intervention, we give those interventions an opportunity to have an impact. Whereas before, you wouldn’t even look at that. You’d just say: ‘The kid’s being disrespectful.’”\nHaving taught at O’Brien for nearly two decades, Higgins described the school’s former approach to discipline as guilt-inducing. “When you’re suspending that many kids, you can’t feel good. Children felt misunderstood, their deeper values and intentions, it hurt relationships between families and students and teachers,” he said.\nResearch on the negative impact of exclusionary discipline on young students is clear, said Dianna R. Wentzell, Ph.D., commissioner of education for the Connecticut State Department of Education. “When people talk about the school-to-prison pipeline, it begins with children’s first experience of school. Suspensions and expulsions create academic deterioration, disconnection, and disengagement for our kids,” said Wentzell. However, when teachers are given the tools to handle student behavior in ways that de-escalate difficult situations, and teach students how to regulate their own emotions and behavior, said Wentzell, the outcome for children is entirely different.\n“Relationship” is a word that O’Brien teachers and administrators use frequently now. In fact, establishing and maintaining strong relationships with students and their families has become a sort of mantra in the O’Brien new order. Bridging the gap between school and home is one key component to understanding, and working with, behavior issues in school, particularly in the early years when children are learning basic social coping skills. “When we see our youngest learners exhibiting certain behaviors at school, we’re really talking about a family in need, and a need for access to services, sometimes mental health or other services,” said Wentzell. “So, organizing the network of services that are needed to support the child has been another area of focus for us.”\nMeanwhile, gym teacher Higgins, who is ready to become a school principal after earning his Sixth-Year Certificate in Educational Leadership, has been pondering a question about equity. It’s a question he can’t get out of his mind. “The empathy I feel for my three daughters is crazy,” said Higgins. “I can always empathize and I’m always trying to re-teach skills because I know they’re going to need them. So the question I can’t stop thinking about is: Am I able to take that same level of empathy and re-apply it to my students at school? That’s when it gets real.”\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

But there’s one we don’t talk about a lot: wooden blocks. Both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are each home to one of the last wooden streets in the nation.\nA quick ramble through the interwebs turns up pages of stories about wooden streets. But if this story had been written 100 years ago, it likely wouldn’t merit publication. Wooden streets were about as common back then as fights over bike lanes are today.\nBetween the mid-1850’s and early 1900s, wood streets were all the rage; everybody who was anybody was hopping on the Nicolson paving train, fitting wooden blocks tightly into streets. The trend had a lot going for it. For starters, horses and carriages traveling over stone pavers and bricks made an awful lot of noise, and contributed to innumerable cases of horse shin splints. (You try pulling a cart and walking on cobbles all day). It also didn't hurt that wooden blocks were cheap.\n“Wooden streets in Pittsburgh were fairly common,” said Matthew Falcone, president of Preservation Pittsburgh, and a member of the city’s Historic Review Commission. But “as people moved toward automobiles, they just became completely irrelevant. They gradually started to disappear.”\nWith a few notable exceptions.\nOnce upon a time, Philadelphia’s S. Camac Street street was lined with granite blocks. They were ripped up and replaced with wooden blocks in 1917, and have vanquished the vagaries of weather, time, and paving trends ever since. That is, until they were covered in asphalt in 2015.\nWhy were they asphalted over? As part of the city’s Historic Street Paving Thematic District Inventory, S. Camac was restored in 1998. But the blocks started to rot, bottom up, and became a safety hazard, said Steve Lorenz, Streets Department’s chief highway engineer.\nHe expects to restore the street by 2018. But it’s a cautionary tale for the city’s other historic streets.\n“If we don’t start making the investments in them, they’re going to start to fall a part and we’re going to lose those treasures in the next 50 to 100 years.”\nIn Pittsburgh, Roslyn Place was the little street that could. It runs between two rows of homes inhabited by people stubbornly proud of their eccentric wooden blocks.\nWhen the city considered paving Roslyn Place in the 1980s, outcry was swift and persistent. The Department of Public Works completed a full restoration in 1985. Worried the street might never get that kind of love and care again, some neighbors still keep a small stash of leftover wooden blocks to make their own emergency repairs.\nThe street has been honored as an historic landmark for many years, and the city has gradually come to recognize that protecting the past protects the future, said Karamagi Rujumba, director of public communications for the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation.\n“Our renewal, really, is based in the preservation and repurposing of those places.”\nHowever, the landmark plaque hanging on a nearby iron gate was mainly an honorific, and offered no real protection. Falcone’s organization, Preservation Pittsburgh, nominated Roslyn Place for a designation that would.\nLast week, Pittsburgh City Council voted to make the street a City Historic Site, which means it can’t be paved over. At least, not without making it past several levels of public scrutiny."},{"url":"http://www.fayobserver.com/news/20170605/city-wants-independent-review-in-firefighter-hiring-practices","title":"City wants independent review in firefighter hiring practices","author_text":"Andrew Barksdale","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Fayetteville Observer","description":"The city of Fayetteville will seek an outside review of its recruitment practices at the Fire Department, which lags behind many other cities at hiring minorities.\r\nCity Manager Doug Hewett announced Monday night he has asked the Raleigh office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review the department’s hiring practices, after several Fayetteville City Council members have grown concerned that only about 3 percent of firefighters are black or another minority.","date":"","full_text":"Fayetteville firefighter Aaron Hagen pulls a hose off a truck as he and his fellow firefighters do hose evalution training May 4 at Fayetteville Fire Station No. 3.

The details included how many, by race and sex, were disqualified during the recruitment and testing process, or just dropped out.\nHewett said state law allows cities to release personnel information that is normally kept private when there is a lot of publicity over an issue and cities wish to try to maintain the public’s confidence.\nOf the 130 black men who had applied, several didn’t schedule a written exam; or failed to show up for it; or withdrew after taking it.\nOf those who took it, 27 passed.\nCouncilman Bill Crisp noticed the discrepancy.\n“I’m trying to fathom, is the written test the problem?” the veteran councilman wanted to know.\nFire Chief Ben Major said the written test is provided by a vendor and measures math and reading comprehension at a 10th-grade level. He said Durham and Winston-Salem use the same test.\nOf the 416 white male applicants, 141 passed the written test. About 200 never took it.\nApplicants who passed the written exam took a physical agility test, and then some were interviewed. They were ranked on a list from which the city hires for its fire academy.\nAccording to a city survey of 19 other North Carolina municipalities, including the larger ones, the average black firefighting hiring rate was 10.8 percent.\nMajor highlighted several initiatives that sought to increase the department’s diversity.\n“We know we are nowhere where we want to be,” said Major, who became Fayetteville’s first black fire chief in 2011.\nOf the first 20 people hired from the recruitment list earlier this year, 19 were white males, and the other a Hispanic male.\nMayor Pro Tem Mitch Colvin asked Hewett what the city could do to boost minority participation and when could the council see results.\nHewett said of the next 11 recruits hired from the list, more than half are minorities. He said if the EEOC declines to do a review, the city could hire a consultant to do a similar probe.\nCouncilman Chalmers McDougald, who had requested the issue be heard Monday, said he was glad the city would seek an independent look.\n“That means we are taking constructive action on our own to make this right,” McDougald said. “We are not making excuses.”\nJimmy Buxton, president of the Fayetteville branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said after Monday’s meeting he worried that a federal review might take a long time and preferred the city hire a consultant.\nHewett told the council he hoped to know by August whether the feds would come to Fayetteville.\nStaff writer Andrew Barksdale can be reached at abarksdale@fayobserver.com or 486-3565."},{"url":"http://www.caller.com/story/news/local/2017/06/05/orange-grove-woman-plays-price-right-tribute-grandmother/371992001","title":"Orange Grove woman plays 'Price is Right' in tribute to grandmother","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Corpus Christi Caller-Times","description":"When \"The Price is Right\" theme music starts, Aimee Wofford is transported to her grandparents' couch.","date":"","full_text":"When \"The Price is Right\" theme music starts, Aimee Wofford is transported to her grandparents' couch.\n\"I grew up watching (it), and it's pure nostalgia,\" the Orange Grove woman said. \"Listening to 'The Price is Right,' listening to (my grandmother) yelling at the TV when they guessed wrong.

It was shot a few months earlier by poachers. It wasn't even the target, its horns are too small to be of much value. But it was in the line of fire as the poachers shot a giant bull rhino in the head and closed in to hack off its horns. The young animal skittered off through the low scrub, shot in the leg and shoulder. Over the following weeks rangers spotted that the rhino was becoming immobile as the shrapnel dug into body tissue.\nExclusive: South African minister linked to rhino poaching\nSo now vets plan to dart the animal with just enough sedation to make it docile.

These are risky procedures and animals often don't survive.\nThe helicopter takes off with the vet and his dart gun on board. It circles the park looking for the herd the young rhino hangs out with.

The helicopter dips sharply down, hovers and the young rhino lurches into sight and runs towards us, with a dart clearly visible in its rump.\nThe vet lands and organises his team. They blindfold the rhino and block its ears - blind and deaf the animal will supposedly be less distressed as they manhandle it into the lorry. One leg is quivering as the animal sags under the effects of the drugs. It takes half a dozen people to push and pull the rhino towards the parked vehicles.\nThe balloon team take hurried selfies before the rhino is safely walked up the ramp into a crate and secured for the journey to Pretoria.\nThe group is planning to create a massive balloon rhino, 15 by 7 metres in size.

(Labrador retrievers top the list.)\nThe four breeds \"are all known for their good temperament, and they tend to be affectionate, loveable and friendly,\" said AKC Vice President and Executive Secretary Gina DiNardo.\nLisa Hsuan, a veterinarian at the Animal Health Care Center in Los Angeles, said brachycephalic breeds are seen as \"cute, funny, trendy and sociable,\" as well as entertaining (think of those videos of skateboarding bulldogs on social media).\nProspective owners should do their research first about the dogs and their issues, however, Hsuan said.\n\"They have breathing issues because of the anatomy of their faces, airways and noses, are prone to yeast infections in their skin folds, which are always moist, and have allergies and sensitive skin,\" she said. \"They have a lot of ear infections, because their ear canals are narrow and twisty. They're also prone to heat exhaustion, since they don't move air very efficiently because of their faces. They pant a lot.\"\nThese dogs shouldn't be allowed to overheat or exercise in warm weather, Hsuan said. Keep them indoors with air conditioning on very hot days, DiNardo added.\nPay attention to cleaning and hygiene, Hsuan said. \"Minimize contact with dust, grass and pollen, which can cause skin inflammation,\" she said. \"Bathing frequently helps to avoid contact with environmental allergens. A lot of medicated shampoos have anti-yeast and anti-bacterial ingredients.\"\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done\nEnergy levels vary among individual dogs and breeds, Hsuan said.\n\"Boston terriers can be wild sometimes, and are pretty high energy,\" said Hsuan. \"Bulldogs tend to be nice, and low energy.

Lola is prissy. She's a sitting dog. She likes comfort. If the ground is too rough, she doesn't like it because it hurts her little paws.\"\nSharon Freeark of Pasadena had reservations about getting a bat-eared, squish-faced French bulldog five years ago, but since then has fallen in love with sporty, pool-loving Booboo.\n\"She's darling with kids, and is so smart, but incredibly disobedient,\" said Freeark, as Booboo panted loudly next to her on a recent walk. \"'Sit, stay, come' mean nothing to her. She's also hilarious, and she'll sit with her feet sticking straight out.\"\nLos Angeles artist Lili Chin's 12-year-old Boston terrier, Boogie, is the muse and model for her business, Doggie Drawings, which specializes in pet portraits, dog art, and infographics on dog behavior and training.\n\"Boston terriers' faces are so expressive and full of character,\" said Chin. \"Perhaps smush-faced dogs look more like people, with their big eyes and pouty mouths.\"\nBoogie used to develop staph infections on his skin every summer. He takes allergy medicine daily. Yet he plays like a puppy, and enjoys long walks.\n\"I love that Boogie likes to sleep in in the mornings.

But once it did, Radtke decided to turn her fixation into a larger project, which ultimately became the new graphic novel-memoir “Imagine Wanting Only This.”\nMany people today, it seems, are drawn to scenes of abandonment — from urban explorers like “Abandoned NYC” to photographers who capture places in decay. In part, Radtke thinks this is because America is a relatively young country, so “we’re being confronted with ruins” for the first time. It’s “alternately interesting and frightening because they’re very recognizable. They resemble the way that we live now.”\nWhile the ruins of ancient Greece seem of a bygone era, for example, the haunting images of America’s abandoned theme parks look very familiar.\nIn “Imagine Wanting Only This,” Radtke weaves together an examination of decaying places — including a church in Gary, Indiana, an island in the Philippines and a forest fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin — with an exploration of the frailty of the human heart. In the end, she imagines a future New York City, underwater, and what that would feel like.\nBelow, see some of Radtke’s images of these decaying places, and her commentary on them. In her words:\nOne of the first places in the book is Gary, Indiana. I stumbled into town with a boyfriend. We were young wannabe artists, looking for something new to see. That was a not mindful way to approach these ruins.\nIt’s like this idea of “ruin porn,” which makes sense to me, but is also troubling. If you Google abandoned places, you find thousands of blogs and people who have wandered around these places, people commenting how beautiful it is, or how gorgeous the way a wall decays is. Very often the spaces are beautiful, but I think to look at something without context is to just aestheticize, or fetishize, like porn. You’re not looking for context, and I think that becomes very dangerous.\nI think we sort of have to look at place like a traveler and not like a tourist. We have to remember that there is no such thing as entering a place without context. If we are ogling it, then it is all about the place, not about the people who were affected.\nWe learned a little about the Peshtigo Fire of 1871 in school. Later, my mother became really fascinated with genealogy and started tracing its roots, and we realized there was a woman in the fire who was our ancestor. According to the Catholic Church, there was a miracle, and our ancestor saved people in a fire. This made me reconsider that fire.\nOnce I started researching the fire more, I realized it was one of the most bizarre and terrifying moments in natural history in America. It was this perfect storm of everything that collided in this way that made it so deadly. And there was also the fact that scientists studied it later to make firebombs.\nI found these historical documents and thought they were so extraordinary, so I layered them with drawings over photos.\nWhether it was in the Philippines, or Gary, Indiana, or elsewhere, I started noticing something — that it was hard to notice what caused a structure to decay. Whether it was bombed out or just decayed on its own, ruins become so similar in their appearance. To me, that was the most alarming thing. Because if you’re just dropped into a place, if you’re not told why something became ruined, you wouldn’t know.\nThere are so many ways to reach the same end. That’s what I saw in so many places. So many possibilities for how something can become abandoned and useless.\nI’ve always been a restless person, anxious about time passing. When I watched a number of my family members die of this rare heart disease that is in my family, I became attuned to how little time we potentially have. And I saw that reflected in our surroundings — and I think I was attracted to those surroundings.\nI drew the section of New York underwater just a year before I finished the book. There was the environmental piece, the fever pitch of climate change, which felt to me more present the longer I worked on the book. With every year we understand the damage we’ve done a little bit more. As I was working on the book I became a little more attuned to that, to how these things impact the physical decay.\nBut I was also thinking so much about the apocalypse. Apocalypse literature and media is so present now. How many movies are about the end of the world? I wonder: Why is that? Why are we so fascinated with these things?\nEarlier Tuesday, Radtke drew from her new graphic novel project, about “difficult men,” with us live on Facebook.

Andrew Cuomo on Monday issued emergency regulations aimed at deterring insurers from leaving the state’s Affordable Care Act exchange market as Congress weighs repealing former President Barack Obama’s signature health-insurance law. The ACA, often dubbed “Obamacare,” set up marketplaces where consumers can buy coverage from different insurers and obtain federal subsidies to help with the cost. But the House of Representatives has passed legislation that would bring huge changes to the current exchange markets. The Senate is working on its own version of the bill. (Vilensky and Wilde Mathews, 6/5)\nBloomberg: Cuomo Takes Steps To Keep New York Insurers In Obamacare\nNew York insurers have concerns about the plan, especially since the regulations to put it in place aren’t yet available, said Leslie Moran, senior vice president at the New York Health Plan Association. “We’re not sure that they can legally just say we won’t contract, because there are already contracts in place,” she said. “We just have some questions and concerns about where they’re trying to go with that.” (Tracer, 6/5)\nIn other Medicaid news —\nThe New York Times: Obamacare Didn’t Destroy Insurance Markets, But It Also Didn’t Fix Them\nRepublican lawmakers and President Trump have criticized Obamacare, saying it took away people’s ability to choose their health plans and doctors, pointing to a recent exodus of insurers that could leave areas with a single insurer or none at all. Mr. Trump has insisted the markets are failing. Supporters of the Affordable Care Act hoped the law would spur more competition among insurers across the country. But so far, the law has not delivered on that promise, especially in states that never had much competition, but it didn’t create the lack of choice in those states, according to a Times analysis of insurer participation provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Without them, the organization would not be able to provide the programs it offers. He especially enjoys working with younger volunteers, like students from Lawrence University, many of whom come from all over the world.\n“It’s fun to watch the young people volunteer,” he said. “They are willing to do anything on the farm and it’s fun. People will donate their time and help out with no expectation of repayment other than walking away and feeling good about having done something.”\nRoberts said retirement allows him to give his time. He used to work at Kaytee Products in Chilton.\nWork “really did not give me enough time to volunteer for things,” he said. “When I retired two years ago, it was fun to all of a sudden have some time.”\nRoberts also volunteers at Habitat for Humanity.

","date":"","full_text":"Note: the opinions expressed in this column are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of High Country News, its board or staff. If you'd like to share an opinion piece of your own, please write Betsy Marston at betsym@hcn.org.\nLuther Propst is a contributor to Writers on the Range, the opinion service of High Country News. He founded and ran the Sonoran Institute for 21 years and now chairs the board of the Outdoor Alliance. He lives in Jackson, Wyoming.\nI spent a week last month backpacking and pack-rafting in and around Utah’s new Bears Ears National Monument. But even while I paddled the silty San Juan River and hiked under blue skies up Cedar Mesa, I worried about the future of Bears Ears National Monument and the state’s other stunning public lands, as well as the rural communities that adjoin those public lands.\nI thought about Utah’s elected Republican leaders, led by Rep. Rob Bishop, Gov. Gary Herbert and Sen. Orrin Hatch, and asked myself: Are they deliberately misleading their constituents about the economic and social consequences of stripping away protections for our public lands? But that conclusion requires a degree of cynicism about our republic that I have not yet reached — at least not while enjoying our wild country.\nPerhaps these politicians truly believe that sacrificing our public lands to development or private ownership will bring back the rural prosperity of yesteryear. If so, they are deluded.\nThe anti-public lands stance of Bishop and his adherents already shut down a major economic engine when it caused the Outdoor Retailer show to pull out of Salt Lake City after a nearly 20-year run. This resulted in a loss to the state of around $45 million annually.\nWhat’s the encore? Will Utah’s high-paying outdoor gear companies, such as Black Diamond, Petzl and many others, respond to consumer pressure and abandon Utah for new homes that are friendlier to outdoor recreation and the nation’s public lands?\nWe moved closer to that scenario on April 26, when Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13792, which initiated a process that looks like it will eliminate, shrink or reduce protection for Bears Ears and more than two dozen other national monuments.\nYet the evidence is overwhelming that monuments and other protected public land actually contribute to the prosperity of rural communities. Just check out the website of Headwaters Economics. Several factors explain why counties rich in public land fare better economically, but two stand out.\nFirst, the West’s most economically successful counties prosper by attracting businesses, entrepreneurs, skilled workers, investors, retirees, tourists and recreational visitors who value public land. Outdoor recreation assets, most often in the form of trails and unscarred public land, are generally the most important amenity a county can offer, and such assets are also among the easiest to provide with local investment.\nSecond, despite his bluster, Trump cannot return rural America to the type of economic prosperity that past generations enjoyed. Those were the decades when mining, oil and gas production, logging, milling and manufacturing provided steady, high-paying jobs to people right out of high school. Those rural-job generators have long been in decline due to automation, global competition and many other factors.\nI can find no credible evidence that good stewardship of our public land impairs the economies of Western rural communities. But such economic fantasies obstruct realistic action to advance prosperity, which depends upon good schools and vibrant downtowns as well as outdoor recreation and access to public lands.\nOf course, there are uncertainties. Can San Juan County, the home of Bears Ears National Monument, develop a balanced economy while avoiding the excessive tourism and commercial growth that characterizes nearby Moab? I think the answer is yes. Across the country, many rural communities have shown that it is possible to balance recreation-based economic opportunity with protection of local values.\nIf those of us who value wild lands act decisively, we can counter Utah’s war on Bears Ears and our public lands.

Becky called 911 while her younger brother, a firefighter, and his girlfriend, a registered nurse, tried to save David’s life. Her call was routed to a dispatch center in Westminster, Vermont. Two mountains and two hours separated her and the call center. When the same dispatcher asked to confirm her address, it was incorrect. By the time the ambulance arrived, David was already dead.\n“I remember [the call taker] saying our address was 705,” she recalled. “I said, ‘No, our address is 707,’ and they kept saying 705. Then they said 747. I don’t even know if that exists [on our street]. Meanwhile, more time was going by and no one came. No one from first response, no police, nothing.”\nTurns out, 747 doesn’t exist on her street in Castleton, Vermont, a small college town with a population of 4,700. Emergency services were sent to the wrong address. It took a local police officer overhearing everything on his radio to clear up the confusion. Seguin recalled absolute chaos at home and lack of understanding on the phone.\n“It’s a pretty horrible feeling knowing your brother is dying and help isn’t coming,” Seguin said. “Then you see the police go flying by your house and you know it’s because they have the wrong address via 911.” Becky said that David’s death was probably not preventable because he “either had an aneurysm or a stroke [and] he would have passed no matter what.” But she doesn’t want anyone else to go through a similar experience.\nAcross the United States, every disclaimer about emergencies tells you to call 911. The American Red Cross teaches certification courses in life-saving skills like CPR, and before administering aid you’re advised to call 911. But most of us don’t know what happens between the time we call and the time help arrives.\nWhen you call 911, the call taker confirms your location, sometimes asking for information to figure out where you are. Then she collects information about the emergency and provides you with pre-arrival instructions. Next, she gets in touch with the necessary remote dispatchers in your jurisdiction. The call taker continues to provide you with further guidance until help arrives. Ideally, fire, police, or medical assistance should arrive in seven minutes — though this response time varies nationwide.\nBudget cuts and shifting priorities have meant that, in many parts of the country, 911 centers have consolidated and become private. Consolidated centers, in theory, have more oversight, better technological capabilities, and more efficient transfer systems. They’re also supposed to be cheaper than local 911 facilities. In the future, we will likely be seeing more of these consolidated systems. The current political climate has made it evident that privatization of public services is a priority for many regions.\nHowever, consolidated 911 centers appear to be riddled with problems, especially in rural parts of the country.\nIn 2010, Seguin’s call would have been handled in Rutland, only 11 miles away. Elizabeth Adams, the site administrator, used to manage a staff of 16 full-time and seven part-time employees. Vermont had already consolidated down to four centers in 2000, so her staff needed to be intimately familiar with 25 percent of the state — including up-to-date knowledge on road closures during periods of heavy snowfall, detours, and areas without mobile connectivity.\nThe problem is exacerbated by inconsistent technology and connectivity issues. In Vermont, one of the most rural states in the country, you can lose a radio station around a corner. The state is littered with dead zones without cell service. Even radio communications suffer in remote parts of the state.\nUber might know exactly where you want to be picked up, but that technology isn’t available to 911 operators. Even in areas of the country known for technological innovations, cellphones do not always transmit location data. In Silicon Valley, California, precise location data was shared in only 10 to 37 percent of emergency calls in 2012.\nThe 911 emergency call scheme was designed to be used in a landline telephone system. Upgrading the tech without upgrading the hardware is like trying to install Windows 10 on a PC circa 1991.\n1999 saw 26% of 911 calls originate from cell phones, while the number today has tripled to over 75%. With the signal bouncing off of cellphone towers all over the place, it can be more difficult to use a computer system to locate callers. The most reliable way to ensure 911 has the right address is to call from a landline, but even that isn’t flawless. Frequently, dispatchers must rely on descriptions of landmarks and other local information.\n“[Often], the caller has no idea where they are and the technology is not there with cell companies,” said Adams. “Local knowledge absolutely matters when a caller can only cite a house color or what the street around them looks like or what they think a road or town is called. [In one case,] we had people trapped in a cave [who] didn’t know what town they were in.”\nEspecially because of the lagging technology, local knowledge is crucial. “Accuracy went downhill since local knowledge was not there anymore,” said Lucas Hall, a firefighter who worked out of Rutland County before and after consolidation. “I can recall one time that I could attribute a death to [dispatch consolidation]. Vermont State Police could not tell if the address was Route 30 North or Route 30 South. It took them over 10 minutes to figure it out. By the time it got figured out and we got on scene, the person was dead.”\nAround the country, in addition to dispatchers no longer having local knowledge, they now have to work longer hours. In many cases, they have less required training than their predecessors.\nToday, Vermont has two consolidated 911 centers — which, according to Adams, are short-staffed by at least 11 people. 911 centers in Washington, DC are staffed by people who do not always know the ins and outs of the city’s roads. Boston’s 911 calls sometimes go unanswered because there just aren’t enough people to answer the phones. In Denver, employees must work up to 16 hours a day. Connecticut experienced issues with their regionalization efforts and even reversed several consolidation decisions.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics says that there will be 3,000 fewer dispatcher positions in 2024 than there were in 2014. In 2010, the BLS projected a 10-year job growth rate of 12 percent. Clearly, the current trends of privatization and technological advancements have shifted that estimation.\nEven in the best conditions, 911 workers have increased risk for developing PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). When dispatchers are overworked, particularly in understaffed centers, they risk burnout.\nResearch has found that decreased shift rotations and shifts longer than eight hours are positively correlated with lengthier call times. “There have been several major medical incidents with remaining dispatchers [in Vermont] who are overworked and overstressed,” said Adams. Recently, a dispatcher passed out at her keyboard and needed an ambulance.\nBecky Seguin said she doesn’t blame the dispatchers for what happened to her family, but rather the government officials who authorized the budget cuts.\nConsolidation of 911 services has often been followed by privatization. Vermont appears to be going that direction under the guise of saving money, even though any economic advantage is negated when the cost of new office spaces and overtime pay is factored in. Vermont’s Public Safety Commissioner Keith Flynn said in 2016 that he no longer wanted the responsibility of handling at least 75 percent of 911 calls. Under the new system, it isn’t clear who would be responsible for emergency calls as Flynn’s statement was refuted by Governor Peter Shumlin. If such a move were finalized, the burden on local municipalities could push the sector into privatization.\nWhen dispatch jobs are privatized, there is always a shake-up in the organization and people lose their jobs. Those who keep their jobs no longer have the benefits of being a government employee. According to news reports spanning the past five years, private dispatch centers experience a high turnover rate, a lack of local knowledge, and communication failures. Even when they continue to be ran by the government, people still lose their jobs. In Vermont, at least 20 veteran dispatchers were laid off.\nThese changes are being made because governments are grappling with a budget crisis that has yet to ease up. Private companies, and private equity firms in particular, have capitalized on the budget gap and sought to fill the void with a for-profit business model. Regions that have made the move to private call centers have done so reluctantly. In Lawrence, New Jersey, council members who voted to transition to a privatized center have said they were not happy about what they had to do.\nFrom callers to dispatchers to first responders, everyone is feeling the consequences of putting fewer resources into 911 services. It will take concerted efforts to ensure public safety is a higher priority than political maneuvering. Privatized emergency services might save the government money right now — but ultimately come at a steep cost to human life.\nThe Development Set is made possible by funding from the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation.

These challenges are particularly pressing given that fathers’ financial and emotional support for their children provides a critical foundation for child well-being. In response, with funding from the Office of Family Assistance, the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation engaged MDRC to conduct the Building Bridges and Bonds (B3) study. The B3 study is rigorously testing new program approaches to support low-income fathers in working toward economic stability and improved relationships with their children. MDRC is partnering with MEF Associates, Abt SRBI, and Mathematica Policy Research to conduct this study.\nThis report describes the three new program approaches being evaluated in the B3 study and outlines the research design of the study. The new program components are:\nthe Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Justice Involved Individuals Seeking Employment(CBI-Emp, which works with fathers recently involved with the criminal justice system and aims to encourage sustained employment by improving coping skills, and encouraging positive thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors;\nthe Just Beginning (JB) parenting intervention, which works with fathers and children together to improve the quality of fathers’ interactions with their young children; and\nthe DadTime engagement intervention,which evaluates the effects of a smartphone app that guides and supports fathers in making and following through on plans for attending JB parenting intervention sessions and prompts them to practice the skills they learned at home.\nEach of the three added program components will be rigorously evaluated using an experimental research design in which fathers are randomly assigned either to a group offered the added program component or to a services as usual group. All fathers can receive the usual program services, but only fathers randomly assigned to the new program component group are offered the new services. In all, the B3 study is expected to enroll around 2,200 fathers across six Responsible Fatherhood program sites.\nThe B3 study includes a process study and an impact study. The process study will provide lessons for the field on key elements for successful program implementation as well as barriers to be overcome when adding these new program components. The impact study will provide rigorous evidence of program impacts over a six-month follow-up period.\nThe B3 study began enrolling fathers and implementing the new program components in the fall of 2016. The B3 study team plans to release initial findings from the process study in 2018 and impact findings for the CBI-Emp, JB, and DadTime engagement interventions in 2019.\nFull\nExecutive Summary"},{"url":"http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/12/12/organic-christmas-trees","title":"Does Your Christmas Tree Need to Be Organic Too?","author_text":null,"keywords":["Food"],"publication_text":"TakePart","description":"The answer has less to do with pesticide exposure at home than ag chemicals polluting waterways where trees are grown.","date":"","full_text":"The answer has less to do with pesticide exposure at home than ag chemicals polluting waterways where trees are grown.\nI was on a bright, brisk winter walk recently in my Brooklyn neighborhood when I saw a folksy hand-painted sign lashed to a chain-link fence: “Organic Christmas trees.” It was like learning I’d been singing the wrong Bon Jovi lyrics for 20 years, another recent revelation. My Christmas tree needs to be organic too?\nOr does it?\nThe answer is a little nuanced, but the short version is yes.\n“As with food, local and organic is best,” The Nature Conservancy advises for your tree choice. Conventionally grown Christmas trees present the same problems as the “Dirty Dozen,” the Environmental Working Group’s annual list of pesticide-tainted produce: To keep trees looking lush, Christmas tree farms use chemical sprays to control pests, and farmers use the pesticide Roundup to control weeds.\n“A lot of stuff growers are using can’t be used in the home anymore, and you can’t wash a tree off like a tomato,” said John Kepner, the project director at Beyond Pesticides, a nonprofit group in Washington.\nBut we also don’t eat Christmas trees, and no studies have been conducted to see if the boughs still have pesticides on them at the time of harvest. By the time the tree stands in your living room, pesticides shouldn’t be a cause of concern, according to Chal Landgren, a Christmas tree specialist at Oregon State University, who says the amount of residue at that point is minimal.\nPesticides inside the Yule log may not be an issue, but toxins trickling into the watershed where the trees are grown is another story. In Oregon, the nation’s leading Christmas tree producer, more than 6 million trees are harvested every year; most of those farms are concentrated along the Clackamas River watershed. Since 2005, Oregon’s Department of Environmental Quality has monitored pesticide levels and found that many exceed EPA benchmarks, including at least two used by the Christmas tree industry. It’s one reason Landgren helped develop the Socially \u0026 Environmentally Responsible Farm program to help teach growers how to reduce chemical use.\n“It’s better for the environment for the tree to be grown without pesticides,” said Adam Parke, who sells organically grown Christmas trees from his Vermont farm in Brooklyn during the holidays, and whose sign I saw on my walk. “It’s better for the health of the growers and the people around them, and it’s better for you not to bring something into your living room that has been coated with pesticides over the several years of its life. Everyone wins.”\nThe Nature Conservancy advises looking for trees native to your region and to check farmers markets for local dealers. But a local, organic Christmas tree may be tough to find. Only 1 percent of the 33 million live Christmas trees sold each year are organic, according to Oregon State University’s extension service. In that case, you’re better off buying a locally farmed tree than a SERF-approved one shipped from Oregon.\nOr make an outing of it, and chop an always organic wild tree. Many of the public lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are open to tree cutting—all you need is a $5 or $10 permit—and selective thinning is good for the health of the forest ecosystem. There’s no worry of deforestation by saw-wielding Charlie Brown types yet: Only 2 percent of Christmas trees are wild chopped. Turning it into a group outing will help reduce the carbon footprint of the jingle bell jaunt.\nWhat about a living Christmas tree that can be planted in the New Year? Parke says it’s only a good option for those who have the time to keep the tree healthy while it’s in the house; most of them die shortly after the holidays because pine trees don’t thrive in the arid, overheated environment of a house or apartment.\n“Remember, though, that cut trees are farmed,” he said. “They’re a renewable resource like any other vegetable you use.”\nEvery expert agrees on one thing: Don’t buy a fake. (Although the reusable wooden trees available on Etsy seem a noble enough choice.) The tinselly, oil-based plastic trees available at drugstores can’t be recycled and don’t decompose once chucked—a tale more befitting the saddest Radiohead song ever written than a jolly rendition of “O Christmas Tree.” That’s hardly befitting the spirit of the season."},{"url":"http://www.newsminer.com/opinion/community_perspectives/nursing-cuts-jeopardize-all-alaskans/article_22026a5c-473f-11e7-a777-cb34a6837173.html","title":"Nursing cuts jeopardize all Alaskans","author_text":"Andrea Nutty","keywords":["Community Perspectives"],"publication_text":"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner","description":"News-Miner Community Perspective:","date":"","full_text":"News-Miner Community Perspective:\nIn the smallest and most remote communities across Alaska, public health nurses serve in incredibly significant roles: They are advocates for the health of our children; they are catalysts for health improvement in our communities; they are a valued resource and trusted confidant regarding family health and wellness issues and they are the safety net for some of Alaska’s most vulnerable residents. That is why the Alaska Nurses Association is urging the Alaska Legislature to reject the proposed budget cuts to the state’s public health nursing program made by the Senate. To underfund public health nursing is to put all our communities at risk.\nPublic health nurses are a high-quality, cost-effective workforce. They know the communities and the individuals they serve, which allows them to provide localized care and establish relationships with their patients. PHNs work to improve the overall health for a population, providing well child checks, immunizations, high-quality screenings, prenatal and postpartum care. They often serve on health-related boards and committees, helping to build healthy communities. Their expertise on parenting and safety, as well as general nutrition and obesity prevention, contribute to the health education of Alaska’s residents. Public health nursing services help build options for community members to choose healthy behaviors, a responsibility that should, in part, continue to fall on the state.\nAlaskans have a long history of combating issues that impact our communities, families and individuals — high rates of suicide, alcohol abuse and sexual assault. Often, a public health nurse is the only resource available to individuals who are homeless, suffering from addiction or struggling with mental illness. PHNs invest skill and time in reaching the vulnerable populations in communities — a workload that cannot easily be absorbed by community health centers. Through their responsiveness to local health needs and their efforts in health education and prevention, PHNs help lay the foundation for sound community health.\nA nearly $2 million cut to the Department of Health and Social Services’ Section of Public Health Nursing is a step backward. It would further unravel the important mission that Alaska’s health advocates work toward. There is no doubt that Alaskans would feel the impact of these cuts. Our state’s public health nursing budget has already seen dramatic reductions of more than 20 percent in the last two fiscal years, resulting in the loss of five health centers in smaller communities as well as over 35 positions, the majority of which were public health nurses. These extensive cuts over the two previous fiscal years have resulted in a significant reduction in services, including restrictions to the age ranges that can be seen for clinical services. Further cuts would eliminate even more positions in communities such as Kenai and Kodiak, which would lose their health centers entirely, leaving these areas without public health resources. Losing more staff and health centers would result in public health nurses being forced to further prioritize and restrict some health services to specific age groups or populations. In short, fewer Alaskans would receive vaccines, fewer children would receive well child exams and there would be fewer investigations into cases of infectious diseases. Further cuts to the Section of Public Health Nursing jeopardizes the health of all Alaskans.\nOther parts of the country have had significant consequences from cutting local public infrastructure, including dramatic increases in cases of HIV and syphilis. Infectious diseases that once threatened us all may return if our public health safety net is damaged.\nLet’s urge our lawmakers to prioritize the health of Alaskans. Let’s keep crucial health services in place and support the wellbeing of our children, our families and our communities. While there are difficult decisions and reductions that will occur in this cost-saving climate, a cut to public health nursing — the backbone of public health in our state — is one that Alaska cannot afford to make.\nAndrea Nutty is the programs director for the Alaska Nurses Association, which advocates for nearly 9,000 nurses statewide."},{"url":"http://www.yesmagazine.org/planet/why-you-want-one-of-these-dutch-weed-burgers-20170526","title":"Why You Want One of These Dutch Weed Burgers","author_text":"","keywords":[],"publication_text":"YES! Magazine","description":"","date":"","full_text":"The hamburger is an icon of the meat-eating world, making it the perfect vehicle to introduce seaweed and the wonders of maritime farming.\n“In Amsterdam, people always ask us whether we smoke weed every day. And weed is a little bit illegal, a little bit naughty. It’s a good way of getting people interested,” says Mark Kulsom, a Dutch entrepreneur with a background in history.\nThis is not exactly accurate. Cannabis and other soft drugs may be illegal in many places around the world, but they’re available in Amsterdam’s many coffee shops.\nAnyway, it’s not cannabis that he wants everyone to feel excited about. It’s seaweed.\nFive years ago, Kulsom and his colleague Lisette Kreischer founded a company called The Dutch Weed Burger after they shot a documentary about the role of seaweed as a future source of protein. Kulsom says the company’s mission is “to work on the acceptance of seaweed becoming a part of the new paradigm.”\nEnter their first product: the weed burger.\nAt first, a seaweed burger seems like an unusual choice, but it begins to make sense after a while. The hamburger is already a global icon in the meat industry. And it’s the epitome of comfort food (there is something about greasy, saucy food you can eat with your hands).\nBut Kulsom, who is vegan, thinks that food free of animal proteins can be just as satisfying as meat, and seaweed seems like a logical choice because it can be used as an alternative to land-based production.\nIt also carries a number of benefits. “Seaweeds grow quite quickly. And nowadays, it’s good to have production systems you don’t have to fertilize, as they will use naturally available resources,” explains Sander van den Burg, a researcher in economy and sustainable development at the Wageningen University and Research. He adds somewhat jokingly, “And you don’t have to give them water.”\nThe Journal of Phycology estimates that there are 72,500 species of algae populating our seas, lakes, and ponds worldwide. About 9,000 of those are seaweed, and the North Sea grows five to six species that are used for human consumption.\nThe largest farms are based in the Dutch province of Zeeland, especially in an area known as the Oosterscheldte, or Eastern Scheldt. “It’s a relatively quiet sea, so there aren’t many waves, and the currents aren’t strong. It’s clean water. So it’s a good location for seaweed farming,” van den Burg says.\nThe maritime equivalent of agriculture is known as mariculture, the farming of marine species; the broader term aquaculture refers to aquatic farming, in both seawater and fresh water. Seaweed is propagated by spreading a long line between two anchors spread apart approximately 1 meter (about 3 feet). Seaweed seedlings (or propagules, as they’re called) are attached to the line and left to grow. Winter is the best time to plant them, with harvest usually taking place in April and May.\n“If you can use seaweed proteins as meat proteins, you can reduce the total environmental impact that comes from the production of meat and soy,” explains van den Burg. Although soy is a popular meat substitute, its impact on the environment has been connected to deforestation and soil erosion; meat’s impact, which takes incredible land and energy to produce, is well documented.\nThe Dutch weed burger is made out of three types of algae: chlorella, a species of microalgae, to dye the bun a subtle green color; sea lettuce for the sauce; and royal Kombu, which grows in the winter and spring, for the burger itself. The Kombu used in the patty is farmed in the Eastern Scheldt province.\nAccording to research from Sheffield Hallam University, seaweed is full of fiber, vitamins, trace elements, and proteins, and has several purported health benefits. “The beauty of seaweed is that there are trace elements that we can’t find in other places,” says Kulsom.\nIt’s also low in calories and can be used as a substitute for either vegetables or meat and other land-based proteins. In Japanese cuisine, it’s used in soups and salads, but it can be added to stir-fries or eaten as a side dish. Microalgae like spirulina and chlorella also act as edible dye.\nEating seaweed carries some controversy. Carrageenan, a seaweed extract added to meat and dairy products and used as an alternative to gelatin in vegan or vegetarian products, has been reported to cause inflammation. Iodine, an element in seaweed, can cause thyroid issues if overconsumed. This makes seaweed tricky: If we eat too little of it, we won’t get the nutritional benefits. But if we eat too much, there are health risks.\nStill, seaweed farming has a lot of potential, and Dutch Weed Burger is just the first step.\nKulsom and his colleagues have recently launched the Dutch weed bagel, which is already sold in Bagels \u0026 Beans, a Dutch chain of bagel cafes. The next product is called weed bites, a vegan equivalent of typical Dutch food known as “kibbeling,” which are chunks of flaky, deep-fried fish.\nBecause climate change is a huge concern, Kulsom and his team don’t harvest wild seaweed. “We believe that seaweed grows in the ecosystems for a reason. We’re not going to harvest seaweed out of the environment because we don’t think it’s the sustainable way,” he says.\nBut there are many other obstacles to sustainable production of seaweed. Profitability is just one of them.\nIn Europe, seaweed isn’t as much a part of people’s daily diet as it is in many Asian countries. And labor is more expensive, and regulations are stricter. “Still, there are couple of seaweed companies that produce seaweed and make money because they can sell it for relatively high prices,” van den Burg explains.\n“People have to be seduced to buy seaweed. And if there are more food products that contain it, its value will increase,” he adds.\nWhile countries like China and Indonesia have a long tradition of seaweed cultivation, the Netherlands still lacks the developed infrastructure for that. “We’re still figuring out how to cultivate it in Europe; it really is something new,” van den Burg says, although he notes as an exception the Dutch tradition of collecting seaweed to flavor products like cheese.\nBut making the switch from agriculture to mariculture isn’t easy. First of all, it requires switching to totally different organisms. And the sea makes for a challenging environment because of the weather conditions such as waves and wind. “If you build something there, it has to be very high quality or otherwise it will be destroyed by the sea,” explains van den Burg.\nHe adds, “If we want to compete with land-based production, we need to bring down the costs.”\nBut lack of infrastructure is not the only issue mariculture faces in the Netherlands. “We need to take care of the environment. We need to take care of the people who work there,” van den Burg says. This is why finding new markets is important. He and his colleagues look to other potential uses for seaweed: green chemicals, fuels, animal feeds, bioplastics.\nSeaweed seems to be popular at the moment, but van den Burg doesn’t want it to be just a trend.\nHe says, “I hope that seaweed will be a real and lasting addition to our diets. Because only then we can really reduce use of other land-based products and make use of its potential.”"},{"url":"http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Police-say-Fremont-officer-holstered-Taser-before-11192953.php","title":"Police say Fremont officer holstered Taser before shooting man","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"SFGate","description":"A Fremont Police officer identified Friday as the one who shot and seriously injured a man armed with a metal pipe had first taken out his Taser before turning to his gun, police said.

She decided to go vegan, abstaining from meat, fish, eggs, dairy and other foods made from animals.\nOn the new diet, her health improved so much that she wondered if Portland, her golden retriever who was suffering from bouts of diarrhea and itchy hot spots on the skin, could also benefit from a vegan diet.\nShe switched him from a meat-based dog food to v-dog, a vegan kibble that uses a pea-based protein and forgoes corn, soy and wheat, and saw his symptoms clear up. She supplements his diet with homemade smoothies and vegetables.\n“He’s a cancer survivor, and he has way more energy than ever,” she said of Portland, who now has a clean bill of health.\nDog owners turn to plant-based foods for ethical, environmental and health reasons, noting that byproducts from mistreated or diseased livestock sometimes make it into foods and that animal agriculture is a leading source of greenhouse gases requiring copious amounts of water. Unlike cats, which are obligate carnivores (cats need nutrients found in meat to survive), dogs can draw the nutrients they need from animal or plant sources.\nMakers of plant-based dog foods, which include brands like v-dog, Halo and Evolution, say their food meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials, an organization of commercial feed producers and government officials that seeks to safeguard consumer and animal health. Vegan dog foods contain protein from plants like soybeans, potatoes or peas and are supplemented with the vitamins, minerals and amino acids, like vitamin B12 and calcium, that the feed organization recommends for dogs.\nVeterinarians agree that dogs need a balanced diet, but are divided over whether plants and supplements make for an adequate meat substitute.\nDr. Lisa M. Freeman, a board-certified veterinary nutritionist and a professor at Tufts University, said that there were no long-term studies on the effects of veganism in dogs. A vegetarian herself, Dr. Freeman understands the ethical argument for avoiding meat but believes that a balanced diet for dogs should include meat. She recommends feeding a dog a high-quality fish-based diet as an alternative.\n“We know a lot about dog nutrition, but there are unknowns as well,” she said. “We want them to be eating a diet that is nutritionally balanced. That means it has all the proteins, vitamins and minerals that they need in the correct ratios and with the best quality control. It isn’t easy to formulate a high-quality diet for dogs, and it’s particularly difficult with a vegan diet.”\nA study published in 2015 in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association that looked at vegetarian commercial pet foods found that of the 24 foods tested, most were not compliant with the minimum labeling standards set by the feed producers’ group. Because some foods aren’t always formulated correctly, Dr. Freeman said, a meat-based diet from a reputable company is the best way to ensure that nutritional gaps are filled.\n“If people are doing this because they are under the impression that it’s healthier, that’s just not true,” Dr. Freeman said.\nWhile plant-based diets are known to have health benefits for humans such as reducing the risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease or Type 2 diabetes, pets will not necessarily get the same benefits.\n“While dogs and cats get some of the same heart diseases that people do, they are very resistant to coronary artery disease, the main heart disease affecting humans,” Dr. Freeman said. “So the nutritional strategies that are beneficial for preventing heart disease in humans are not useful in dogs and cats.” Since obesity is the main risk factor for diabetes in cats and dogs, she said, maintaining a pet’s ideal body weight with a consistent diet is the key to successful treatment of that disease.\nDr. Michael Roth, a veterinarian in Richmond, Mass., and himself a vegan, said that some dogs have an allergy to common dog food ingredients like beef or dairy and that some may benefit from a vegetarian or vegan formula to help ease skin rashes and other allergy symptoms. He recommends that his clients try a vegetarian formula for 12 weeks to see if it relieves itching and improves the skin and coat. Many owners who see an improvement in their dogs, he said, are reluctant to move their dogs back to a meat-based diet.\n“Is the vegan diet the best diet for all dogs out there? I don’t think anyone would say that, just like nobody would claim there was one best diet for all the people on the planet,” Dr. Roth said.\nDogs, like humans, have varying degrees of tolerance for certain foods, he said. He fed his most recent dog, Dawn, a golden retriever, a vegan diet. She lived to age 11 before developing a fatal cancer, about the same age that her brother, Sam, raised on a diet that included raw meats, also died of cancer.\nDr. Lorelei Wakefield, a veterinarian who regularly sees vegan dogs as part of a consultancy service she runs in the Philadelphia area, says that her clients do completely fine on the diet. “We don’t know yet what the healthiest diet is for them, but ethically, for someone who believes in vegan ideals, it makes sense,” she said.\nMary Straus, who runs a website called DogAware.com and writes for the WholeDog Journal, a holistic dog newsletter, disagrees. She says that some nutritional deficiencies take months and even years to show up in vegan dogs. Signs of malnutrition range from a dull coat and digestive issues to heart disease and early death.\n“Our knowledge of nutrition is not great enough to ensure that this is the case, even if A.A.F.C.O. guidelines are met,” she said in an email, referring to the feed-makers’ group. “To be safe, a new set of guidelines would have to be developed for vegan diets, along with long-term testing to ensure that the diets actually meet the animals’ requirements. This has never been done.”\nMs. Straus, who feeds her Norwich terrier Ella a mostly homemade diet with meat, worries about the consequences of forcing dogs to eat a diet they were not designed for.\nIf you aren’t willing to give a dog the diet it really wants, she says, get a rabbit or a guinea pig: “There are lots of herbivores out there that make great pets.”"},{"url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/after-two-lung-transplants-one-brain-tumor-and-15-years-seattle-u-student-earns-his-degree","title":"After 2 lung transplants, 1 brain tumor and 15 years of hardship, Seattle U student earns a degree","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Seattle Times","description":"Beset by health problems so severe they almost killed him over and over, Steven Jenkins is graduating from Seattle University at age 33, 15 years after he started.","date":"2017-06-11","full_text":"Steven Jenkins spent 15 years trying to earn his bachelor’s degree at Seattle University, dogged by health problems so severe they nearly killed him.\nBorn with cystic fibrosis, he survived a double-lung transplant.

Helfgott, professor and chair of criminal justice. “I have never seen anything like it in my life.”\nSeattle U President Stephen Sundborg, who gave Jenkins a full-ride soccer scholarship despite his diseased lungs, called it an amazing story.\n“The number of times through the years he almost didn’t make it, the way the other players responded to him — the family is heroic, and so is Stevie, for just persevering through it all,” Sundborg said.\nCoach Fewing said Jenkins “was not a token sick guy on the team — we brought him on because we thought he could help us, and we thought we could help him. We knew he was going to educate our guys.\n“He was a good soccer player,” Fewing added. “He just couldn’t run.”\nLast week, the slim 33-year-old with shaggy brown hair juggled a soccer ball on Seattle U’s field, looking fit, if a bit wan. He’s just recovered from another hospitalization, this time for meningitis.\nHe shrugs that off as a minor setback. Three years ago, after his first lung transplant failed, he lived in the shadow of death for months, bedridden and barely able to move.\nSon of a Sounder\nSoccer is in Steven Jenkins’ genes. He is the son of Tommy Jenkins, who was a midfielder from 1976 to 1979 for the Seattle Sounders in the old North American Soccer League. Tommy Jenkins later coached Fewing for the Seattle Storm in the late 1980s.\nAt the age of 2, Steven Jenkins was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a progressive genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits a person’s ability to breathe.\nBut Jenkins loved soccer. Keeping the disease a secret from everyone but his high-school coach, he played for his Kentwood High team — and took some abuse from fellow players for not being able to run well.\nFewing knew the family and Jenkins’ spirit, and when he asked Sundborg about bringing him to Seattle U and putting him on the team, Sundborg went a step further, offering him a full-ride soccer scholarship.\nAt first, Jenkins’ lungs were working well. He was on the team in 2002 and 2003, and played in four games. His health deteriorated in 2004, and he had to sit on the bench. But even when he wasn’t on the field, the team looked to him for inspiration.\nFewing remembers putting his team through a punishing running drill one day, and as he asked them for more, his players started to fade. But then, for the last few sprints, they gave it their all.\nFewing later realized they’d looked across the field and seen Jenkins running a drill of his own, pushing himself with his damaged lungs.\nIn 2005, the disease worsened. Jenkins had to withdraw from school and move back home. He got on the list for a transplant and tried to stay healthy. But his lung function dipped to 17 percent. “I was pretty close to not making it,” he said.\nIn an 11-hour surgery in March 2007, Jenkins received new lungs. By the fall, he was back in school.\nBut soon afterward, he began experiencing bad headaches. In December, a doctor discovered the cause: a 3-inch tumor under his brain.\nWhen a first round of chemo did nothing, doctors told him his chances of beating the tumor were less than 20 percent. Jenkins hung on to those odds. Perhaps, he reasoned, he’d be one of the lucky ones.\nHe underwent strong chemo and a stem-cell transplant, as well as radiation that made his throat so sore he couldn’t eat solid food for two months.\nWiped out, Jenkins didn’t re-enroll in college right away. But by the middle of 2010, he started to feel like himself again. He began to look forward to going back to school.\nAnd then in December of 2010, he came down with swine flu and pneumonia, which caused his immune system to begin to reject his lungs.\nThis time, he was ineligible for a lung transplant, having had cancer a little more than two years before. Because donor lungs are so scarce, under transplant rules he needed to be in remission for at least five years.\n“I was devastated,” he said.\nHis parents did some research and found that the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio was willing to bend the rules and take his case. Jenkins moved to Cleveland.\nHis sister Kelsey was on the verge of dropping out of Seattle Pacific University and moving to Cleveland to support him when he got a call from Dr. Michael Mulligan, the director of the Lung Transplant Program at UW Medicine.\nI’ve looked into your case, the doctor told him. Come back to Seattle. We’ll do it here.\nJenkins went back on a waiting list for new lungs in June 2011, but he was low on the list because he’d already had one transplant. His health steadily declined. By early 2014, he was living on the first floor of his parents’ house in Kent, bedridden and on oxygen.\n“I felt so lonely, so depressed,” he said.\nA turning point\nIn February, he called his old soccer coach for words of inspiration — a conversation Fewing remembers well.\n“So I’m on the phone with him, and he’s really struggling, and I said we would pray together,” said Fewing, who caught the call on his cellphone while he was in the driveway walking toward his house. “I got on my knees. It was raining a little bit. I just prayed. I could not tell you what I said.”\nBut for Jenkins, it was a turning point, a powerful moment that helped him hang on. He thought to himself, Lord, my life is yours. If I make it through this surgery, I’ll do what you want.\nOne month later, on March 3, 2014, the call came from the hospital: A match had been found.\nJenkins posted a message to friends on Facebook before his family rushed him to the hospital. Tonight’s going to be a long night. If you want to stay up with me, come to the hospital. You know what’s happening.\nThis time, the surgery did not go as well. Jenkins’ kidneys stopped working, and he gained 30 pounds of fluid in 24 hours. Doctors warned he might not make it. Surrounded by friends and family in the intensive-care unit, half-conscious, Jenkins rallied. His kidneys started up.\nJenkins started back at Seattle University in early 2016, beginning with a single class. When it went well, he took two more. By winter 2017 he was taking three classes. He needed to finish three more courses this spring to graduate.\nStill, it was touch-and-go. In March, he came down with the flu and pneumonia. Three weeks ago, he had a case of viral meningitis and shingles.\n“These are speed bumps for me,” he said. “I didn’t want anything to get in the way of graduating.”\nHelfgott, the criminal justice professor, said through it all, Jenkins kept working on his degree, taking some online courses and keeping in contact with his professors via email.\nJenkins thinks often about the prayer with Fewing, and how he can make a difference in life. After graduation, he’ll do an internship with Urban ArtWorks, a Seattle nonprofit that offers opportunities for artists and young people to work together to create public works of art. He’s spoken to a class at a Seattle elementary school about the importance of perseverance, and he’d like to do more of that.\n“Everyone has the ability to make a positive impact on the world,” Jenkins said. “Hard work, believing in yourself and persevering — I just want to convey that message to anyone and everyone.”\nHe’s deeply grateful to the university for its support — especially Fewing, Sundborg, his professors — and to his family, including his sister and his mother, Barbara.\nJenkins knows the world is full of germs and infections. Every time he goes outside, he risks catching something that puts his life at risk.\nBut he isn’t about to stay inside.\nHe shakes hands to say goodbye with a firm grip, and without fear.\n“I can’t live in a bubble,” he said. “That’s not why I got lungs. I went through the hardships of getting them to live a full life.”"},{"url":"http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/05/31/521940884/english-learners-were-hurt-the-most-when-texas-limited-special-education","title":"English Learners Were Hurt The Most When Texas Limited Special Education","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"NPR.org","description":"Texas has the lowest rate of children in special education in the country. A closer look at the numbers shows that English language learners are missing out the most.","date":"","full_text":"Angel Vazquez is 9 years old, has hearing loss in both ears, has trouble speaking and struggles to concentrate in class. He's a year behind in school, just learned how to read and is still learning English. For nearly two years, his mom, Angeles Garcia, tried to get him evaluated for special education at his elementary school in Houston.\nGarcia sent the school three letters, pleading for an assessment. She even included medical documents describing some of his disabilities, but she says the school ignored her.\nWhen a response finally came, officials at the Houston school district told Garcia that Angel would have to wait another year to be evaluated because he'd emigrated from Mexico and needed time to assimilate. According to federal law, that's no excuse. To make matters worse, the school communicated with Garcia using letters written in English, not her native language, Spanish.\n\"I really feel bad because my son is growing up and time is going by,\" Garcia says in an interview in Spanish. \"And what's going to happen with him? He's not advancing at all.\"\nIn Texas, Garcia's story isn't rare.\nThe background\nA major investigation by The Houston Chronicle recently revealed that districts in Texas were pressured by the state to provide fewer students with special education services, which can be expensive. In 2004, the Texas Education Agency told districts to restrict special education enrollment to 8.5 percent of all students. At the time, Texas' average was close to the national rate of 13 percent.\nAfter that, the state's rate plummeted to the lowest in the country.\nAn analysis of the numbers shows that children like Angel, who are learning English, have been shut out even further. The rate for English language learners enrolled in special education was just 7.6 percent in 2016.\nThe numbers and why they matter\nWhile the overall number of English language learners in Texas has increased by about 40 percent since 2006, their enrollment in special education has fallen by 5 percent.\nWhile 9 percent of English-speaking students in Texas are identified with special needs, only 7.6 percent of English learners were in 2016 — even below the state's arbitrary mark of 8.5 percent.\nThat's nearly half of the national rate. In the United States, 13.8 percent of students learning English are identified for special education, according to federal data.\nIn the Houston Independent School District, where Angel goes to school, the disparity for English learners in special education is even worse. Their overall enrollment has increased by 11 percent since 2006, at the same time their special education enrollment has dropped 35 percent.\nGraciela Reyes-McDonald, a school psychologist who works with many Spanish-speaking families, says extra barriers, like language and culture, make it more difficult for these families to navigate the system. They may not even know about special education services or how to access them.\n\"What's going to happen to all these kids if they're not getting the intervention that they need now?\" Reyes-McDonald asks.\nIn Houston, Angel's mom, Garcia, did find some extra help with Disability Rights Texas, an advocacy group.\n\"We are meeting parents every day who have stories very similar,\" says Dustin Rynders, an attorney with the group. \"We're fed up,\" he says.\n\"If it's more difficult for [parents] to write letters to the school, if it's more difficult for them to find agencies like me to advocate for their rights, they're more likely to be left out.\"\nThe response\nThe Houston school district would not address details when asked why Angel Vazquez, and so many English learners, seem left out of special education.\nThe district did say that the state's target of 8.5 percent doesn't guide its policy.\n\"HISD's goal is to meet every child's unique academic, social, and emotional needs, regardless of whether they are given the 'special education' label,\" wrote Jason Spencer, HISD spokesman at the time.\nSpencer also pointed out the district has new translation services for families who don't speak English and are involved in special education.\nWhen asked why English learners count for so few of the children receiving services statewide, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency said in an email that they've reminded districts of their legal obligations.\n\"In his visits with superintendents across the state, Commissioner Morath is confident school districts are aware of their obligations to identify and provide special education services to students,\" said spokeswoman Lauren Callahan.\nBut federal authorities have put Texas on notice and Texas lawmakers recently passed a bill that ensures the state can never create a limit on special education again.\nThe good news\nThis spring Angel was finally evaluated and is doing better in school. He now has hearing aids, receives speech therapy and is learning how to manage his ADHD. His mom, Angeles Garcia, says the whole thing is bittersweet.\n\"Maybe if they had paid attention to what I told them, he would be a little better off. But now we're looking ahead and the good thing is that now he has help.\"\nGarcia worries about other immigrant families who still struggle to receive services because they don't know the laws or speak English."},{"url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/05/why-do-iranians-even-bother-voting/526866","title":"Why Do Iranians Even Bother Voting?","author_text":"Shervin Malekzadeh","keywords":["The Atlantic","The Atlantic Magazine","The Atlantic.Com","Atlantic","News","Opinion","Breaking News","Analysis","Commentary","Business","Politics","Culture","International","Science","Technology","National And Life"],"publication_text":"The Atlantic","description":"On Friday, they will cast ballots in their presidential elections—precisely because they do not believe in their system.","date":"","full_text":"“However much you remove yourself from politics, you’re still inside this system” read the meme imploring me to vote during my last visit to Tehran in 2016. It was one of the many dozens of Facebook, Telegram, and text messages delivered by grassroots activists anxious to secure a friendly parliament for Iran’s incumbent president, Hassan Rouhani. Their shoestring get-out-the-vote campaign—loosely advanced on social media and amplified by a sprawling network of classmates, teachers, and second cousins—ran alongside an official state apparatus determined to signal its legitimacy to the world by producing a healthy turnout on election day. All told, more than 61 percent of Iran’s eligible voters showed up to vote in an off-year legislative election, nearly double the 36 percent participation rate in the 2014 U.S. Congressional elections.\nAs Iran nears the end of another election season, its 12th for president and the 35th overall since 1979, dozens of analysts are already explaining why elections in Iran do not really matter or, should Rouhani lose, why they do. Most point to the limited range of choices offered to Iranian voters as proof that the vote there is mostly theater, cover for the feckless pursuit of power between elites in an autocratic system. Some use the perceived charade as a pretense to renew the call for regime change in Tehran, left dormant under the Obama administration and its peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue in 2015.\nAlmost none of these analysts will say much, if anything, about the nearly 40 million citizens who are expected to turn up to vote of their own accord on May 19, or why they bother. Voting in Iran, one is left to imagine, is only for the true believers or for the easily duped, participants in a collective act of dissembling that adds up to nothing.\nIn fact, however, many Iranians vote because they do not believe in their system; they vote precisely out of a lack of faith.\n“Voting is a religious duty and a holy act,” they are told by those in charge, and so citizens double down on the premise as an act of vigilance, determined to meet the state on its own terms as well as to bear witness should the authorities deny citizens their votes. Against the fevered proclamations of radicals on either side of the Iranian political spectrum, the grassroots opposition stands firmly for the belief that presence at the ballot box is prevention, and that prevention is “better than a cure.”\nIran’s diminished democracy offers few guarantees, but one certainty is that low turnout opens a path for reactionary elements to take control of the government. This was the painful lesson of the era of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose rise to power was abetted by a boycott of the 2005 elections by the public. Disillusioned with the reform movement of outgoing president Mohammad Khatami, and convinced that it made little difference who occupied the presidency, many Iranians stayed home on election day. Just under 28 million Iranians, 60 percent of the voting population, bothered to vote in the second-round runoff between Ahmadinejad and the late Hassan Rafsanjani—anemic by Iranian standards. It wasn’t long before a bevy of incompetents took advantage of the voters’ apathy, rushing in to occupy the political field abandoned by those holding out for more democratic conditions in Iran.\nIt was a mistake that many in the opposition have sworn to never repeat. In 2009, some 40 million Iranians, a record 85 percent of the eligible population, cast their ballots in the presidential election in an effort to put Ahmadinejad and his allies out of office. The implausible reelection of Ahmadinejad sparked Iran’s worst crisis since the overthrow of the monarchy, producing the Green Movement protests that paralyzed much of the country for nearly a year.\n“Even those who don’t believe in the system and the leadership,” Ali Khamenei implored last spring, “come to the ballots.”\nNearly 37 million would turn out in 2013, despite the violent suppression of the Green Movement just four years earlier. They were determined to vindicate the movement’s imprisoned leaders, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrobi, and to finally force an answer to its slogan, “Where is my vote?” That these many voters were empowered to do so by the very system that they oppose is the story missing from the coverage leading into this month’s presidential election.\nThere is a sense among some Iranians that the current impasse between state and society actually offers the best situation for all involved. Although electoral participation ensures the survival of the Islamic system, as so many critics have correctly pointed out, the reform movement does want to sustain a political structure that at the very least prevents Iran from tumbling into chaos. Trapped in the logic of a political system that craves participation, and chastened by the street protests that for a time appeared to put the very survival of the 1979 revolution at risk, Iran’s authorities appear willing to go along for now despite the risk that a popular president will emerge to challenge an unpopular leadership.\nExamples of what could happen if they don’t go along are not difficult to find, and lie within easy reach in the lived experiences of Iran’s regional neighbors, in Egypt and Iraq. At stake, as so many voters told me in 2013 and again in 2016, is whether Iran will avoid becoming “another Syria,” the site of a bloody civil war that invites the intervention of foreign powers. Participating in a system, no matter how flawed, is better than having no system at all. Seen in this light, an election is not a mere one-off, an opportunity for a revolutionary breakthrough leading to the demise of the current system; it represents one piece in an open-ended process of incremental reform and progress.\nThere is no mystery to all this, no “Persian paradoxes” for analysts to solve. If anything, the traumatic events of recent years have invited a new and unexpected transparency on the part of the public and the authorities alike. “Even those who don’t believe in the system and the leadership,” Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei implored in an astonishing statement last spring, “come to the ballots, as the election belongs to the nation.” Eager to avoid a reprise of 2009, the electorate has, in earnest, taken him up on his offer to put the country first and believe in civil redemption. Their participation in elections is still more about hope than an expression of bad faith."},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-05-16/first-and-second-generation-dutch-wonder-whether-theyll-ever-be-considered-locals","title":"First- and second-generation Dutch wonder whether they'll ever be considered locals","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Public Radio International","description":"Identity, integration and Islam were critical issues in the Dutch spring elections in the Netherlands. At the heart of the debate was who belongs in the Netherlands.","date":"","full_text":"CROPlina.jpg\nLinawati Sidarto surveys the shelves in a small toko, or Indonesian grocery store, in Amsterdam.\n\"I need to get sambal of course, the hot sauce,\" Sidarto says as she selects the biggest jar of a fiery-red paste commonly used in Indonesian cooking.\nSidarto, 51, often comes to this toko to buy food that reminds her of home. She was born in Jakarta, but has lived in Amsterdam for 19 years, almost as long as she lived in Indonesia. She has a Dutch husband and two teenage daughters whom she describes as \"very Dutch.\" She also speaks fluent Dutch — yet she still doesn't quite feel like she belongs.\n\"There's a bit of a derogatory word for [non-Western] migrants, which is allochtoon,\" Sidarto explains. \"My children will always say, 'Ah yeah, but mum, you're an allochtoon, you would never understand.'\"\nShe laughs before adding: \"It’s a running joke, but there's some truth behind it. Emotionally, I will never feel like I'm Dutch. I will probably never ever be able to say that I’m Dutch.\"\nThis question of who is Dutch — and what being Dutch means, and who gets to decide — has been fiercely debated in the Netherlands during recent months, with a divisive election in March revolving around issues of identity, integration and Islam. Extreme right-wing politician Geert Wilders was instrumental in stirring up nativist sentiment. Elements of his rhetoric were also adopted by the incumbent Prime Minister Mark Rutte. His open letter to people in the Netherlands to “act normal or get out” was widely interpreted as a call for immigrants to integrate — assimilate, even — to the greatest extent possible.\nFor relative newcomers like Sidarto, however, it's not always so straightforward.\n\"[The Dutch] don't necessarily easily let other people in their inner circle,\" she explains, recalling her first years here when she was in her 30s. \"They do not ask you to come around to have dinner at their house or have a drink. They're polite with you at work, and then they leave. That was very, very difficult for me in the beginning.\"\nComing from Indonesia, a former Dutch colony, Sidarto spoke the language pretty well before she even arrived and had relatives already living in the Netherlands. Still, she struggled to make it her home. Even now, most of her friends are other immigrants or Dutch people who have lived abroad.\nFor Kami Zarker, 42, the experience of trying to become Dutch was even trickier.\nZarker arrived as a refugee from Iran in 1994; he was then a 21-year-old with no Dutch language skills and zero knowledge about the Netherlands. At a botanical garden in Amsterdam, where he goes to be reminded of his home country, he explains how, in his first years here, he worked hard to learn Dutch and make friends. His application for asylum was denied, but he managed to get a study visa instead, and eventually was granted citizenship.\nZarker now has an Iranian wife and two kids in Amsterdam. When he goes back to Iran, he says he no longer feels at home — but nor does he feel fully at home in the Netherlands. He jokingly describes himself as 60 percent Dutch and \"40 percent myself.\"\n\"I think if I'm here over 100 years, I will not really be Dutch,\" Zarker says with a shrug. \"I try to be that, but I am not.\"\nFor second-generation immigrants, the question of how Dutch they are is even thornier.\n\"I get that question all the time,\" says Huda Abu Leil, a 22-year-old social work student who was born in the Netherlands. Her father is from Palestine, and her mother is from Morocco. \"'What do you feel? Do you feel Palestinian or do you feel Moroccan or do you feel Dutch?'\"\n\"Sometimes I feel Dutch, but with all these things that happen in the world, some Dutch people don't see me [as] Dutch,\" Abu Leil adds, a note of frustration in her voice. \"I always think, 'Oh, OK, what am I?'\"\nAbu Leil went to an Islamic school here and wears a loose headscarf. She says all but one of her friends are Muslim, which she admits she finds “weird.” Still, she has never felt she had to justify her identity to anyone, apart from one time.\nPouring some sweet Moroccan tea, a staple in her house, she recalls an incident during her first year at the university when her classmates reproached her and her Muslim friends for being too “cliquey.” Abu Leil couldn't see what was wrong — she says everyone at her university hung around in a clique of some sort. It got so tense that a professor intervened and asked Abu Leil and her friends what was going on.\n\"And we were angry, because we thought, 'Why are you coming to us, why don’t you talk to the classmates [too]? Why is it always us? What did we do wrong?' When I think about it, it makes me angry and confused.\"\nThe idea that a newcomer has to go the extra mile to fit in is a common one in the Netherlands, indeed in many countries.\nBut at what point does someone who has built their life here just get to be themselves and still feel like they belong?\nVenetia Rainey reported this story from Amsterdam.\nOne more thing…\nPRI takes a global approach to the news of the day.

In addition, labor and delivery will also move from Albert Lea to Austin.\nAll inpatient behavioral health and addiction recovery services will move to the Albert Lea campus, Siems said.\n“Both the Albert Lea and Austin campus will continue to offer 95 percent of the services our patients use on a regular basis, including primary and specialty care, pregnancy care, outpatient surgeries and procedures, emergency room care, and services such as lab, radiology and pharmacy,” she said via e-mail. “The Austin campus will house inpatient care (medical/surgical/pediatrics), ICU, inpatient surgeries and childbirth.”\nAcross the country, a growing number of health systems have been consolidating services at nearby hospitals.\nLast year, Minneapolis-based Allina Health System merged two acute care hospitals in Anoka County under one license in order to eliminate duplicate services at the nearby medical centers. Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids and Unity Hospital in Fridley continued distinct operations, but the smaller medical center in Fridley took the name “Mercy Hospital — Unity Campus.”\nAs part of the changes at the medical centers, Allina shifted maternity care to Mercy and consolidated mental health service at Unity."},{"url":"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2017/0417/Under-new-framework-for-student-progress-states-try-new-ways-to-grade-schools","title":"Under new framework for student progress, states try new ways to grade schools","author_text":"The Christian Science Monitor","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Christian Science Monitor","description":"The Obama-era Every Student Succeeds Act, which comes into effect this year, gives states greater flexibility in how they judge schools.","date":"2017-04-17","full_text":""},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/16/us-teenager-dies-after-succession-of-caffeine-drinks-in-two-hours","title":"US teenager dies after succession of caffeine drinks in two hours","author_text":"Haroon Siddique","keywords":["Us News","World News","Health"],"publication_text":"the Guardian","description":"Doctors said healthy 16-year-old died from ‘caffeine-induced cardiac event’ after latte, Mountain Dew and energy drink","date":"2017-05-16","full_text":"A teenager in the US died because he consumed too many high-caffeine drinks in a short space of time, a coroner has said.\nDavis Allen Cripe died last month, about an hour after collapsing in his high school near Columbia, South Carolina. The 16-year-old had consumed a latte from McDonald’s, a large Mountain Dew drink and a highly caffeinated energy drink in just under two hours, Richland county coroner Gary Watts said.\nDoctors said Davis died from a “caffeine-induced cardiac event causing a probable arrhythmia”, according to Watts.\nHe added that the teenager was considered healthy and the autopsy showed no sign of an existing undiagnosed heart condition.\n“This is not a caffeine overdose,” said Watts. “We’re not saying that it was the total amount of caffeine in the system, it was just the way that it was ingested over that short period of time.”\nDavis weighed about 90kg but would not have been considered morbidly obese, according to Watts, who added that he would have been unharmed by the same amount of caffeine on another day.\n“We’re not trying to speak out totally against caffeine,” said Watts. “We believe people need to pay attention to their caffeine intake and how they do it, just as they do with alcohol or cigarettes.”\nThe particular energy drink Davis drank was not known but a witness said it was from a container the size of a large soft drink.\nAccording to caffeineinformer.com, a McDonald’s latte has 142 milligrams of caffeine, a 20-ounce Mountain Dew has 90mg, and a 16-ounce energy drink can have as much as 240mg.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both say that caffeine consumption of up to 400mg a day – about four or five coffees – is believed to be safe for adults. The EFSA says 200mg a day is safe for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and that single doses of up to 200mg do not give rise to safety concerns. The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages the consumption of caffeine and other stimulants by children and teenagers.\nCaffeine has been linked to previous deaths, although the cases are few and far between and the link not always clear-cut. In 2011, 14-year-old US schoolgirl Anais Fournier, who had a pre-existing heart condition, died after drinking two cans of Monster energy drink, containing a total of 480mg of caffeine. The company denied any responsibility.\nIn 2015, two students at Northumbria University, were were left fighting for their lives after they were accidentally given the equivalent of 300 cups of coffee in a botched experiment. They eventually made a full physical recovery.\nTony Heagerty, professor of medicine at Manchester University, said it was likely that Davis had a genetic heart condition, which may not have revealed itself in the autopsy, and that the caffeine put stress on his heart.\n“I think the caffeine must have interacted with something wrong with this heart,” he said. “If you are an unfortunate person with a pre-existing condition and put yourself in a stressful situation by drinking too much caffeine you are in danger.”\nBut he said the levels consumed by Davis would not be harmful to the overwhelming majority of people, except for making them feel strange.\nMike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: “It is well known that caffeine increases a person’s heart rate but it can also trigger more serious effects, including heart palpitations, in those who are more sensitive to caffeine.\n“People with cardiac abnormalities, including inherited heart conditions, and those who drink toxic amounts of caffeine are more susceptible to the side-effects of caffeine. Tragic accidents like this are rare but, with increasingly strong coffees and caffeinated drinks on the market, moderation is key to monitoring your caffeine intake.”\nCaffeine: what are the dangers?\nThe World Health Organisation recognises caffeine use disorder and caffeine dependence as illnesses.\nDrinking large amounts of coffee can lead to unpleasant side-effects such as irritability, problems sleeping, restlessness, according to the NHS.\nIt can also result in babies having a low birth weight, which can increase the risk of health problems in later life, or miscarriage.\nCaffeine constricts the coronary arteries, leading to a temporary rise in blood pressure. If drunk in sufficient quantities it causes calcium to be discharged from inside cells and causes the heart to beat faster. In the most extreme cases – caffeine toxicity – it causes major organs to shut down.\nSymptoms of a caffeine overdose include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, convulsions and a high heart rate."},{"url":"http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2017/05/the_city_of_cleveland_should_n.html#incart_river_home","title":"The city of Cleveland ignored airport safety in demoting Abdul-Malik Ali: editorial","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"cleveland.com","description":"The city of Cleveland showed a shocking disregard for airport safety when it demoted the field maintenance manager who sounded alarms about snow-removal staffing and de-icing supplies at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, writes the editorial board.","date":"","full_text":"The city of Cleveland needs to move quickly to right a grave wrong -- and to show it takes airport safety seriously -- by making things right with whistleblower Abdul-Malik Ali.\nAli was demoted more than two years ago from his job as Cleveland Hopkins International Airport field maintenance manager after he sounded snow-removal safety alarms with federal officials.\nA May 23 federal order directing Ali's immediate reinstatement -- that also ordered the city to pay more than $20,000 in back pay and damages to Ali and more than $75,000 to his lawyers -- severely chastised Cleveland for its handling of the matter and for ignoring airport safety concerns during winter storms. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited violations of a federal aviation whistle-blowing statute in directing Cleveland to reinstate Ali as soon as the city received the order, no matter whether the city planned to appeal.\nThe report paints a picture of retaliation by leaders at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport -- followed by efforts to justify their actions – after a whistle-blowing employee raised safety concerns to the FAA.\nThere are indications that efforts may be underway to settle the matter along with a related civil lawsuit Ali has filed.\nThe city should swiftly settle. And it ought to learn a little respect: An employee willing to put his own job on the line and report dangerous conditions is an employee worth keeping. Don't waste any more of the taxpayers' money in fighting this case.\nAli, credited by OSHA with improving airport snow-removal safety after he became airport maintenance manager in about 2003, was demoted to menial tasks in February 2015 right after he revealed to the Federal Aviation Administration serious understaffing for snow and ice removal at the airport.\nPart of Ali's new job included counting garbage cans.\nAirport whistleblower Abdul-Malik Ali said Wednesday that the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is woefully unprepared for winter weather, with only a fraction of the airfield maintenance workers it needs to clear snow and ice from the runways.\nOSHA's recent report, much like its preliminary finding in February, makes it clear that then-airport Director Ricky Smith wrongly demoted Ali hours after learning the whistleblower held a private meeting with an FAA inspector.\nThe city didn't respond immediately to requests for comment. It has claimed that it demoted Ali because he was a poor manager, failed to follow the chain of command and refused orders to return to the airport from his home after his work shift had ended because he'd consumed two beers and felt it would be unsafe to drive back immediately. The OSHA order said the evidence indicates that these were not the actual reasons for his demotion.\nAli's demotion hurt airport safety. OSHA found there were 16 diversions of aircraft for snow and ice conditions in the weeks immediately after Ali was relegated to counting trash and recycling bins during his demotion -- a 33 percent increase over prior diversion rates.\nThe OSHA report also portrays a bean-counting mentality at the city that caused key airport officials repeatedly to ignore Ali's input or overrule his concerns about continuing staffing deficiencies relative to city snow-removal-safety agreements with the FAA.\nIf Cleveland officials had listened to Ali, the city might have avoided a $735,000 FAA-ordered civil penalty in September 2015 -- later reduced to a $200,000 fine -- for violating an agreement to staff the airport adequately during the winter.\nIn a settlement the FAA announced Tuesday, Cleveland agreed to address complaints about poor snow and ice removal that created safety issues at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and forced flights to be diverted.\nThe city needs deeply committed and knowledgeable airport maintenance officials such as Ali. It needs to take them and their concerns seriously, and it needs to spend the money necessary to assure safety at Hopkins airport during winter storms. Besides revealing shameful details of this episode -- and the need to make Ali whole for his professional and personal distress -- the OSHA report and order are a wake-up call to Cleveland officials to put airport safety front and center from now on.\nAbout our editorials: Editorials express the view of the editorial board of cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer -- the senior leadership and editorial-writing staff.

Stanley A. McChrystal shares his personal experience with service — both in and out of uniform.\n“Over the past few decades, we’ve come to equate service with military service,” says McChrystal. “In reality, service is much broader: education, healthcare, conservation. I’d like to see us expand that term ‘service members’ or ‘people in service’ as people doing the complete spectrum.”\nMcChrystal is the chairperson of Service Year Alliance, which is partnering with NationSwell to make a national service year — a paid opportunity to develop real-world skills while solving some of the most pressing challenges facing local communities — a common opportunity for all young Americans.\nService year corps members, including Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, and YouthBuild participants, earn modest stipends that are funded by public and private dollars. Occasionally, some members also receive money to pay for school or student loans.\nAs these programs face potential elimination under the current White House budget proposal, they continue to garner bipartisan support from voters and members of Congress. Local and national leaders, social entrepreneurs and members of the nonprofit and business communities are calling for service years to become a rite of passage for young Americans.\n“Federal funding for national service is not where most of the funding comes from, but it’s essential. It is something that precipitates all of the programs moving forward, and so it’s a key part,” says McChrystal. “If the federal government won’t invest in young people — the most critical part of our nation — there’s no point in rebuilding our roads and bridges in America.”\nAt a time when our communities are deeply divided, studies show that service year alums are more civically engaged. They vote. They volunteer. And they purposely seek out friendships with people they didn’t know growing up.\n“In communities across the nation and around the world, tens of thousands of service year corps members are already working to address local needs — making a huge impact on important issues such as education, inequality, opportunity youth, the environment and health,” says Shirley Sagawa, CEO of Service Year Alliance. “Imagine the impact if we unleash the energy and idealism of the next generation of young Americans through a service year.”\nNationSwell asks you to join our partnership with Service Year Alliance.

But his Chamber of Commerce speech didn't say how to achieve economic growth. Here are some ideas.","date":"2017-02-10","full_text":"Back in November, I found myself at a dinner party with 20 or so of the region’s most accomplished business movers and shakers. One attendee estimated that the net worth of the room was in the billions. (Obviously, my presence significantly brought down the curve.) As the conversation ebbed and flowed, a common theme emerged: Concern for the economic future of the city. And puzzlement over the Mayoral vision, a year into the new administration, for how to grow the local economy.\n“It’s been a year, and all we’ve been hearing about is ‘soda tax, soda tax, soda tax,’” said one macher. “Well, I support pre-K. But where’s the economic development plan? How are you going to grow jobs?”\nOthers agreed, and soon the room was full of commentary attesting to the city’s lack of business friendliness. There were complaints about our status as the highest-taxed big city in America this side of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and about the inaction of our elected officials: “The only time I hear from a politician is when he wants a check,” someone said. Then came a rundown of a string of recent laws—ranging from paid sick leave to the ban on employers’ asking about applicants’ salary histories to the speculation that Councilman Bobby Henon will soon be introducing paid family leave legislation. We have to compete for talent and market share with our surrounding suburbs, I heard time and again; unilateral laws like these render us uncompetitive. A tipping point may have been reached earlier this week when Dan DiLella, President and CEO of Equus Capital Partners, announced that he was taking his 135 employees to Berwyn—in part, due to the city’s challenging business climate.\nOur dinner party Masters of the Universe were all doing quite well, and had been for some time. Yet they shared a concern about the trajectory of Philadelphia’s story: low growth (of the top 10 major cities, we rank ninth in economic growth at a paltry 1.9 percent), high taxes, high poverty, struggling schools. In the year since Jim Kenney’s election, where was the plan to grow jobs? Where was our new story?\nWorldwide, cities are having a moment as engines of innovation; my impression has been that Mayor Kenney has been incurious about that trend, attached instead to old school tax and spend, redistributive policies. His signature year one accomplishment, after all, was the soda tax; not once did the Mayor tell the taxpayer what the return on that investment would be. Would it cause the graduation rate to increase 13 years from now? By how much? He posited pre-K as long-term economic development…well, cool: What’s the goal for how many jobs we derive from this tax? In other words, how do we judge success?\nWe were never really told. In fact, we weren’t even told during Mayor Kenney’s job interview—the campaign—how he’d pay for pre-K. Back then, you’ll recall, it was to be funded by zero-based budgeting, a truly inventive idea that would have placed the city at the forefront of urban innovation. Once in office, though, that reform morphed into the soda tax.\nThat’s why I eagerly awaited Mayor Kenney’s second annual address to the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce last week. Would he drop a new vision on us?\nSadly, no. What we got was more of the same. Yes, there was the recap of the Mayor’s two big ticket investments, the pre-K program and Rebuild, the administration’s $500 million investment in parks, libraries and rec centers. And, yes, there are green shoots of disruptive thinking in Kenney’s government, like Startup PHL. But Kenney’s Chamber speech was mostly a recitation of small-ball policies—L\u0026I’s cutting in half the time it takes to process permit applications, the Commerce Department’s Capital Consortium of lenders that have made four loans totaling $385,000—and announcements of plans to study issues like “transportation and planning” in order to take action at some point down the road. The speech wasn’t devoid of content, so much as lacking an animating idea that might lead you to say to yourself: “Wow. Someone’s rethinking who and what we are.”\nIn effect, as last week’s speech illustrates, Jim Kenney is an old-time big city mayor who believes in redistributing wealth. Problem is, given our tax base, there’s precious little to redistribute. What the times call for is a vision that neither seeks to tax and spend or cut its way to growth. Rather than slicing more pieces of an ever-shrinking pie, we need to grow by changing what we think about city government, and the role of the mayor in it. That’s what the most cutting-edge cities have done, as The World Bank’s 2015 Competitive Cities report found.\nIn a study of 750 cities that outgrow their home countries, the World Bank concluded that all share these traits: “(a) business leaders were consulted about their needs and the constraints they encountered in their operations; (b) infrastructure investments were made in collaboration with the firms and industries they aimed to serve; (c) skills initiatives were designed in partnership with firms, ensuring that curricula addressed their practical needs; and (d) industries were supported where they had a real commercial potential, through collective initiatives with the private sector rather than through the public sector alone.”\nIn other words, rather than piling more taxes and regulation upon businesses, forward-thinking urban leaders have learned to partner with them. That might not play well on the political Left, where outrage over crony capitalism tends to obscure what pro-growth mayors in our fastest-growing cities have long known: Their citizens won’t have jobs without the businesses to hire them.\nSo what if Mayor Kenney announced that Philadelphia was going to unleash the genius of capitalism to help cure our problems? That would require widening the aperture of his lens and getting beyond our usual zero-sum debates. Just imagine if his pro-forma laundry list before the Chamber included some of these ideas:\nThe City of B Corp Love. Philadelphia is already arguably the most B Corp friendly city in the nation, but few know it. Here’s the background: Berwyn-based nonprofit B Lab created a new type of company, the B Corp, which extends members’ fiduciary responsibility beyond just shareholders, to stakeholders such as employees, the environment and the surrounding community. B Lab confers a type of Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval when it comes to social responsibility for its more than 2,000 member companies, including well-known brands such as Patagonia and Ben \u0026 Jerry’s.\nMarketing Philly as the B Corp city would set us apart, sending a much-needed signal that private sector bottom line success and civic health needn’t be at cross purposes. Already, thanks to then-Councilman Jim Kenney, Philly is one of the few cities to give companies a B Corp tax break. Expanding it would also be a way to attract and keep millennials here: “All of the startups that come see me?” venture capitalist Richard Vague once told me. “It’s a settled issue for them. They’re B Corps.”\nGreenlight Governing. Why is it that Pittsburgh is the testing ground for Uber’s experiment with driverless cars, while Philly only recently okayed the use of ride-sharing? In part, it’s because Mayor Bill Peduto practices the art of “Greenlight Governing”—and Jim Kenney should do the same. Peduto did more than pay lip service to his city’s burgeoning startup community. He went out of his way to give them the freedom to experiment…and even fail.\n“It’s not our role to throw up regulations or limit companies like Uber,” said Peduto. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st Century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.” Peduto has given Uber unprecedented free rein, including exemptions from regulations. You want to attract talent? Let it be known that you’re a city that will let it flourish.\nBe The Convener-in-Chief. The old way of being the city’s chief executive uses the power of your office to reward friends and punish enemies, and to prescribe solutions from on high. The new way is to invite others to join you at the problem-solving table.\nRather than piling more taxes and regulation upon businesses, forward-thinking urban leaders have learned to partner with them. That might not play well on the political Left, where outrage over crony capitalism tends to obscure what pro-growth mayors in our fastest-growing cities have long known: Their citizens won’t have jobs without the businesses to hire them.\nCase in point: Every couple of years, headlines are made because, unlike in other cities, our nonprofit universities don’t pay a set fee to the city as a Payment In Lieu of Taxes. The debate rages for a few days…and then fizzles out. Well, how about we move past the predictable back and forth and, instead, Mayor Kenney brings the presidents of the city’s universities into City Hall and tells them the issue is settled: They’ll never again be asked to pay PILOTs. Rather, he’s inviting them to partake in a new challenge—call it Solutions In Lieu of Taxes, whereby each institution deploys its arsenal of intellectual talents and its resources to develop new answers to the intractable problems that plague us beyond the borders of its own campus.\nThis idea of government convening the best and the brightest to work for the common good is already making inroads elsewhere. In Dallas—one of the fastest-growing local economies in the nation—numerous stakeholders have come together to form the Dallas Innovation Alliance, a nonprofit public-private partnership recognized by the White House for turning Dallas into a smart city. Corporations, private sector firms, nonprofits and government officials have all worked together to make Dallas a hotbed of innovation and economic growth strategies. For Philadelphia, what might be most innovative about the Dallas Innovation Alliance is the simple idea of the business community and government working so closely together.\n“In Philadelphia, there’s a history of outsourcing leadership to local government,” says Professor Richardson Dilworth of Drexel’s Center For Public Policy. “Public-private partnerships like in Dallas can offer us a way to get all key stakeholders to sit at the problem-solving table together.”\nTo be clear, the idea of widening the net of problem-solvers isn’t just about adding more voices to our civic conversation. Social impact, or pay-for-success, bonds have actually been used by governments to pay for public policy programs. In this model, the private sector works with governments and philanthropies to fund social programs—and investors only see a return once clearly defined social impact goals are met. This type of collaboration with the business community stands in stark contrast to how Philadelphia has long approached governing, with an emphasis on broad-based taxing and stringent private sector regulation.\nThink Huge. Finally, perhaps the most important thing Mayor Kenney can do to jumpstart the local economy is to think more ambitiously, to summon JFK’s audacious call to put a man on the moon in 10 years. People want to be inspired. So what can Jim Kenney’s moonshot be? I’ve argued before that it ought to be high-speed rail in the Northeast Corridor. The timing may be fortuitous, now that we’ve got a president who, despite some odious thinking in other respects, says he wants to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. Kenney should convene a broad-based coalition that lobbies for a resurrection of Amtrak’s $150 billion 2012 plan for high-speed rail.\nThirty-seven minutes from 30th Street Station to Penn Station? What would the economic impact be of that? It would make our city a bedroom community of New York, which would grow jobs, real estate values and tax revenue. For those who worry that such an eventuality would lead to a type of Upper East Side-ification of Center City, that’s a justifiable concern worthy of study. But the fact remains that the type of incrementalism and outdated thinking outlined in Mayor Kenney’s Chamber address doesn’t align with the pressing needs of this moment. You want to finally adequately fund our schools? Make a dent in the poverty rate? Grow jobs in every neighborhood? Address the pension crisis that, left unchecked, will only further drain education and infrastructure spending?\nWell, think big, Mr. Mayor. Because only after you grow, can you then redistribute.\nHeader photo by Philadelphia City Council via Flickr"},{"url":"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/compass-points/2017/05/22/japan-vows-to-close-ports-to-illegal-fishing","title":"Japan Vows to Close Ports to Illegal Fishing","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Japan, one of the world’s largest fish importers, has joined 47 other governments in ratifying the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA)—an international treaty designed to stop illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU ) fishing. ","date":"","full_text":"Joining U.N. treaty shows commitment to keep illicit catch out of global market\nThis blog has been updated to reflect the current number of Parties to the Port State Measures Agreement.\nJapan, one of the world’s largest fish importers, has joined 47 other governments in ratifying the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA)—an international treaty designed to stop illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU ) fishing.\nAdopted by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in 2009, the PSMA helps governments strengthen their port controls to better recognize suspicious catch and, when appropriate, reject or seize it. The pact also facilitates regional cooperation among parties to the treaty to help reduce the once-common practice of “port shopping” by illegal fishing operators.\nIllegal and unreported fishing is estimated to account for up to $23.5 billion worth of seafood each year—or as much as 1 in 5 wild-caught marine fish. Illegal fishing practices destroy marine ecosystems, deplete fish populations, and threaten the livelihoods of those in coastal communities whose economies rely heavily on fishing.\nWhile Japan maintains its long tradition of fishing, its fleets no longer catch enough to meet domestic demand. As a result, Japan has become the third-largest market for fish imports, after the European Union (EU) and the United States.\nAs more governments join and implement the PSMA, illegal fishermen will have a harder time getting their ill-gotten catch into the global seafood market, which will greatly reduce the profit potential of fishing outside the law. The treaty calls for an information-sharing system that requires countries to notify nearby ports when a vessel may be seeking to land illicit catch. This reporting structure and information exchange aim to improve port-level data on fish landings and vessel activity.\nJapan maintains significant influence on international fisheries issues and seafood markets: the country is, among other things, the world’s top consumer and fishing nation of the bluefin tuna, a species that fishing has depleted by more than 97 percent. With such stature, Japan must engage with other governments to implement precautionary, science-based catch limits that support sustainable commercial fishing.\nStill, the government’s efforts to curb illegal fishing have been gaining momentum for several years. As a member of all regional fisheries management organizations, Japan has consistently supported the adoption of catch documentation schemes and other anti-IUU fishing measures.\nAfter an EU-Japan statement in 2012 on fighting IUU fishing, Japan showed a real commitment to ratifying the PSMA. Now that it has done so, Japan is setting an example for other fishing nations in the region, and the work must persist. With each ratification the treaty becomes more effective. The Pew Charitable Trusts applauds Japan’s commitment to fighting IUU fishing, and we are confident that more governments will sign on to the PSMA this year.\nTony Long leads The Pew Charitable Trusts’ efforts to end illegal fishing worldwide."},{"url":"https://ensia.com/articles/soil-protects-plants-devastating-disease","title":"What is it about this soil that protects plants from devastating disease?","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Ensia","description":"Figuring out why certain soils keep plant parasites at bay could be a boon for agriculture around the globe","date":"","full_text":"September 21, 2016 — Plants around the world are constantly under attack — often with big implications for humans. In the 1960s, millions of elm trees in Britain, France and the U.S. fell victim to Dutch elm disease, which clogs the vessels that carry life-giving water to the trees’ leaves. Starting in the late 1980s, Brazil’s thriving chocolate industry crumbled when witches’ broom disease devastated its cacao trees. Lately, banana growers have become increasingly concerned about Panama disease, which is spreading rapidly and threatening to wipe out their crops. The attackers, like many of the infectious agents that harm humans, are tiny but devastating fungi, bacteria and other microbial parasites.\nNow, global change is giving these parasites an edge, helping spread deadly diseases around the globe. Desperate to find a way to fight back, some scientists have turned their attention to a special type of soil known as “disease-suppressive soil.” The plants that live in it seem to magically remain relatively free of disease, even if disease-causing parasites are present. These scientists hope to improve understanding of this phenomenon so they can use it to help make agriculture more sustainable.\nPerfect Combination\nIn the same way forts have armies to protect themselves against invaders, plants growing in disease-suppressive soil have beneficial bacteria to defend themselves against parasites attacking them from the ground. While all soil has microbes living in it, disease-suppressive soil has certain types of microbes that can fight off disease.\nNot all soils are disease suppressive, and those that are weren’t always that way. In many cases, soils develop protective qualities only after they host a single plant species and that species has experienced years of disease outbreak. It appears that, much as our bodies gain defenses in the form of antibodies after we get sick from the illnesses such as chicken pox or measles, soils can gain defenses in the form of the perfect combination of microbes that fend off future attacks from the same pathogen.\nJust as each human has a unique set of fingerprints, each type of soil has a unique signature based on the kinds and numbers of microbes present.The phenomenon was observed as early as 1931. Since then, scientists have tried to understand which specific microbes can defend plants against their attackers and how they do so. Today, advances in microbiological and sequencing technology are enabling researchers to tease apart the complexities of the microbes that live in soils — which organisms are they, exactly, and just what do they do? It turns out that, just as each human has a unique set of fingerprints, each type of soil has a unique signature based on the kinds and numbers of microbes present.\nA team of researchers based at Washington State University has focused on the suppression of take-all disease in wheat for decades. Take-all, which destroys grasses’ roots, is caused by a fungal parasite. Even before this group started its research in the 1960s, it was clear that growing wheat continuously in an area that had experienced take-all would lead to a decline in the disease. Plant pathologist David Weller, a member of the research team, determined that these suppressive soils had greater amounts of a type of bacteria called pseudomonads. When research geneticist Linda Thomashow joined the group in 1985, she used molecular methods to learn more about pseudomonads and how they produce antibiotics to fight off pathogen.\nIn the 1990s, Linda Kinkel and Neil Anderson, plant pathologists at the University of Minnesota, went looking for a microbial explanation for an inexplicable decline in scab, a disease that disfigures crops like potatoes or radishes with dark, splotchy growths, in a potato field in Minnesota. Kinkel and her colleagues found that the soil contained greater amounts of a certain type of bacteria called Streptomyces than soil that does not suppress disease. These bacteria produce antibiotics used as weapons against parasites.\nCharacterizing such “microbial signatures” is just the first step toward further harnessing soil microbes to prevent disease.\nUnderstanding the soil microbes that protect plants from disease can be a matter of life and death — not just for the plants but for us as well. “Technology provides a static picture,” says Kinkel, “but these systems are so not static. … We need to understand not just which species are present, but how they are interacting.” Translating their discoveries about disease-suppressive soil into management solutions, she says, will require a shift in thinking. While many researchers are searching for a “silver bullet” microbe that can be added to soil and fight off disease, the system is much more complex than that.\nUnderstanding the soil microbes that protect plants from disease can be a matter of life and death — not just for the plants but for us as well. Human population is growing, and plants are key to ensuring our future food security. Enlisting the help of microbes found naturally in the soil is critical, Thomashow explains, because “the agricultural systems are weakest in parts of the world where population growth is the greatest and the people can’t afford chemicals.”\n“It’s not this pie in the sky,” Kinkel says. “[These soils provide] long-term, stable, virtually complete disease suppression without any pesticide input.”\nSo what do we need to bring disease-suppressive soil into management practices more widely?\nIf scientists can learn more about how disease-suppressing microbes are functioning in this soil and how suppression originates, they can inform management practices to better protect plants against disease while reducing the need for artificial chemicals.\nHowever, Kinkel points out, for that to happen smoothly, communication will be key. Scientists may figure out ways to introduce disease resistance into soil, but that won’t do any good if their recommendations don’t mesh well with practices farmers use in real life such as rotating crops. “I may know things [growers] don’t, but they know a lot of things I don’t,” says Kinkel. In other words, successfully applying what has been learned about disease-suppressive soils to agriculture will require both scientists and farmers to listen to each other.\nAs Thomashow puts it, “We have a big toolbox, but we are not yet employing all the tools we have.”\nEditor’s note: Kayleigh O’Keeffe produced this feature as a participant in the Ensia Mentor Program.

Collins III, an incident that is being investigated by the FBI as a hate crime.\nCollins, who is black, was killed early Saturday morning while waiting for an Uber with two friends on the University of Maryland campus in College Park. He was 23, had last week been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army and was scheduled to graduate from Bowie State University on Tuesday.\nUrbanski, who is white, is being charged with first- and second-degree murder and first-degree assault in the attack according to a press release from the University of Maryland Police Department.\nAccording to reporting by ABC News, at the hearing Urbanski’s lawyer, William Brennan, asked that he be released under a combination bond of money and GPS monitoring device. Brennan told the court that Urbanski was intoxicated and incoherent at the time of the attack, and that his travel would be restricted to his parents’ home. Both of Urbanski’s parents were in court, ABC reported. The judge ordered Urbanski held without bond while his lawyers did further research on the GPS monitoring option. His next court appearance is scheduled for June 15.\nAuthorities said Urbanski did not know Collins. The attack is being investigated as a hate crime because Urbanski’s involvement in a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation.” University of Maryland Police Chief David Mitchell described the content as “despicable,” saying it shows “extreme bias,” particularly toward African Americans.\nAt Bowie State, friends and mentors mourned the loss of a promising future military officer.\n“Richard was an outstanding kid. He was everything we look for in a leader,” said Lt. Col. Joel Thomas, a professor of military science who worked closely with Collins in the campus Reserve Officers Training Corps, better known at ROTC. “He was a scholar, he was an athlete he was a leader. But most importantly he was a guy with good character and that’s what counts the most for us.”\nAccording to court documents, Collins and his friends were approached by Urbanski as they were waiting for a car about 3 a.m. Saturday. As they were waiting, Urbanski approached and said “step left, step left if you know what’s best for you.” Collins said “no.” Urbanski then attacked him.\nThe attack was also captured by security cameras.\nCollins’s friends called 911, and he was taken to Prince George’s Hospital Center, where he later died. The friends also identified Urbanski as the attacker. According to court papers, Prince George’s County police apprehended Urbanski about 50 feet from where Collins collapsed.\nBowie State spokesperson Damita Chambers told the AP that students are planning a vigil Monday night for Collins, the eve of what would have been his graduation. The school also plans a moment of silence during the commencement, according to Chambers. A candlelight vigil was also held at the site of the stabbing on Sunday evening.\nUniversity of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh led Maryland graduates and their families in a moment of silence during the university’s commencement on Sunday, according to the Washington Post. “We are still in shock that a young man, so full of promise, should have his life cut short, so suddenly,” Loh said in a statement to the university community.\nBut to some students, the specter of racism was not a total surprise at the College Park campus, where, earlier this month, a noose was found at a fraternity house, and posters featuring white nationalist themes were discovered on several campus buildings earlier this spring.\n“Racism is real. It’s real on this campus,” said Darius Craig, a black University of Maryland student. “Administration needs to begin to take it seriously. This has got to stop. This has got to stop.”\nThe message was the same at a makeshift memorial where Collins was killed. “It has to stop,” said Diane Teichert, as she added a pink rose from her garden to a bus stop bench overflowing with flowers and candles. The 64-year-old from nearby University Park wept as she spoke of her “terrible sadness and anger” and resolve to respond. “I don’t think putting flowers on a memorial is enough,” Teichert said.\nOn Twitter, the #FearTheTurtle hashtag normally used by Maryland sports fans became a forum for discussion about whether university officials have done enough to respond to what writers said is an undercurrent of racism on campus.\nWriting on a local community page, Anne Arundel First Alert, on Facebook, people who said they were acquaintances of both men reacted to the tragedy.\nThe disturbing developments prompted American University President Neil Kerwin to issue a statement “given the hate crime that occurred on our own campus on May 1.” The reference was to the appearance of bananas, hung from nooses and inked with the letters of a predominantly black sorority, on AU’s Northwest D.C. main campus the same day that a member of that sorority became president of student government.\nWhile the AU campus police work with the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office to investigate the crime, the campus has stepped up visibility of its public safety personnel, Kerwin wrote.\nWAMU is licensed to American University."},{"url":"https://ww2.kqed.org/news/the-trials-of-marvin-mutch","title":"The Trials of Marvin Mutch","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"KQED News","description":"Marvin Mutch is a former California lifer inmate, one of thousands of men recently paroled as the state strains to reduce its prison population.

Hundreds of thousands of pages of records were temporarily posted online, downloaded and brought to the attention of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nThe documents show the foundation is using the same tactics as environmental groups, albeit with the opposite aim:\nBradley dollars have been used to fight federal regulations that limit emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants, challenge scientists who warn of the threat of rising levels of greenhouse gas and to tout the economic benefits of fossil fuels.\nOne example is the Washington, D.C.-based Competitive Enterprise Institute.\nA November 2015 Bradley memo describing a $100,000 grant notes the conservative think tank \"continues to aggressively use the federal Freedom of Information Act process to expose the collusion between (Environmental Protection Agency) officials and global warming alarmist groups.\"\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a federal agency, says that \"97% of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.\"\nNevertheless, the debate over global warming policy has persisted, with critics — including many funded by Bradley — arguing the concerns are overblown.\nThey have also raised objections over the cost of making changes, such as those tied to the Obama administration's plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants by about one-third by 2030.\nMichael Grebe, president and chief executive officer of the Bradley Foundation from 2002 to July 2016, said the foundation under his leadership did not hold a formal position on man-made global warming.\n\"The foundation has supported some organizations that are skeptical — that the science actually bears out what’s been predicted or projected,\" he said.\nBradley’s current CEO, Rick Graber, declined an interview on the foundation's spending on energy and environmental issues. In an email, Graber said the expenditures are not a major focus of the organization and would not be in the future.\nThe internal records show the foundation issued at least $2.1 million in grants involving energy and environmental issues between 2013 and 2015, a period in which Bradley gave out about $112 million.\nThe money spent on energy and the environment is likely higher, but totals for some groups with multiple grants were often lumped together in the documents.\nTaking on environmental groups\nBradley's donations over the years have challenged the activities and claims of environmental groups.\nYear\nBradley fund recipient\nAmount received\n2015\nFoundation for Research on Economics and the Environment\n$20,000\n2015\nIndependence Institute\n$50,000\n2015\nManhattan Institute for Policy Research Inc. - Center of Energy Policy and the Environment\n$250,000\n2015\nSand County Foundation\n$100,000\n2015\nThomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy\n$50,000\n2015\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute\n$100,000\n2014\nUrban Ecology Center\n$10,000\n2014\nCenter for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change\n$10,000\n2014\nFoundation for Research on Economics and the Environment\n$20,000\n2014\nSand County Foundation\n$100,000\n2014\nThomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy\n$50,000\n2014\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute\n$75,000\n2013\nUrban Ecology Center\n$10,000\n2013\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute\n$100,000\n2013\nCenter for Consumer Freedom\n$150,000\n2013\nCenter for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change\n$10,000\n2013\nConsumers' Research - Center for Energy Innovation and Independence\n$150,000\n2013\nConsumers' Research - Center for Energy Innovation and Independence\n$100,000\n2013\nFoundation for Research on Economics and the Environment\n$25,000\n2013\nHeartland Institute\n$92,500\n2013\nIndependence Institute\n$75,000\n2013\nManhattan Institute for Policy Research Inc. - Center of Energy Policy and the Environment\n$250,000\n2013\nSand County Foundation\n$263,591\n2013\nThomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy\n$50,000\nIn one instance, it provided $150,000 to Washington, D.C., public relations executive Rick Berman to launch a campaign starting in 2014 known as “Big Green Radicals,” which takes aim at national environmental organizations and some of their affluent supporters.\nThe money, according to a Bradley memo, went to the Center for Consumer Freedom — one of the several organizations Berman runs. The center has targeted labor unions, food activists and environmentalists.\nAccording to the memo, Berman's group conducted research profiles of the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the group Food and Water Watch. It also seeded “several thousand fans” on Facebook and posted videos disparaging — and sometimes poking fun — at the environmental left.\nIn one video, Big Green Radicals portrayed actor Robert Redford, a member of NRDC’s board of directors, as a hypocrite for opposing development of an eco-friendly housing development because of how close it was to his own Napa Valley home in California.\nAfter the Beverly Hills City Council voted in 2014 to ban fracking, an oil-drilling technique, the group created a video deriding opponents as out of touch. In it, a woman standing on upscale Rodeo Drive said she agreed with the ban and tries to be energy conscious.\n“When we go out on the weekends, we see no point in paying the valet three times when three of us get together,” she said. “(We) either drive the same car or Uber it.”\nIn 2014, Bradley donated $100,000 to the Madison-based Sand County Foundation to oppose \"radical environmental groups\" seeking to place the greater sage-grouse on the federal endangered species list in 11 western states, according to a memo.\nBradley officials were interested in protecting the bird, but through private efforts, not government ones.\nThe documents show the foundation's view that environmentalists are using the Endangered Species Act to \"curtail economic activities related to energy development through the use of fracking in the western part of the United States.\"\nThe Sand County Foundation initiative was successful. In September 2015, the U.S. Interior Department announced it would not put the grouse on the endangered list.\nA Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman said last week that the population of the grouse swings in 10- or 15-year cycles. Biologists are expected to conduct a review of its status in 2020, she said.\n“The idea behind the project was to bring together energy developers and ranchers, both of whom were being blamed for the decline of the sage-grouse and have them develop proactive and positive conservation solutions,” said Kevin McAleese, president of the Sand County Foundation. “The idea was to reverse the role of being on the defensive to being on the offensive.”\nSand County has received $14.3 million from Bradley since 1992 to support voluntary efforts for soil and water conservation and to improve wildlife habitat.\n“The principles that we shared were respect for property rights, liberty and voluntary local solutions to environmental problems,” McAleese said\nQuestioning climate change\nIn a 2013 ranking of energy and environmental recipients, Bradley named the Heartland Institute of Arlington Heights, Ill., the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research of New York as the best.\nThe organizations have expressed skepticism at times over the role humans play in climate change and have emphasized instead the economic costs of shifting away from fossil fuels.\nIn 2014 and 2015, Bradley gave a total of $175,000 to the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s energy and environment program, which is led by Myron Ebell who was in charge of President Donald Trump’s transition team at the EPA.\nEbell has been critical of what he calls “alarmism” of climate scientists who contend that increasing levels of greenhouse gas and warmer global temperatures are a cause of rising oceans and vanishing arctic ice.\nAnother recipient has been the Virginia-based CO2 Coalition, a group that has downplayed the harm of rising carbon dioxide levels — and cited what it describes as potential benefits of global warming, such as plants that grow faster and are more resistant to drought.\nFormerly known as the George C. Marshall Institute, the organization has received more than $4 million from Bradley since 1986 for its work on a variety of issues, including environmental ones, according to the internal documents.\nWilliam Happer, a Princeton University professor emeritus of physics, heads the coalition. Happer was among those who were invited to meet with the president-elect at Trump Tower before the inauguration.\nIn 2015, Happer told a U.S. Senate subcommittee in 2015 that “few realize that the world has been in a CO2 famine for millions of years,” adding that “increased agricultural yields and modest warming far outweigh any harm” from rising levels of greenhouse gas.\nNick Surgey, director of research at the left-leaning Center for Media and Democracy, which tracks Bradley’s philanthropic activities, said science has already settled the question of human impact on the changing climate.\n\"The alarmists and their supporters’ whole purpose for existing are to try to suggest that there is a debate,\" he said. \"It is trying to create an idea in people’s minds that there is some debate about the fact that the climate is changing.”"},{"url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/05/30/deadliest-storm-in-more-than-100-years-mauls-moscow","title":"Deadliest storm in more than 100 years mauls Moscow","author_text":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1526386","keywords":["Post Keywords"],"publication_text":"Washington Post","description":"16 people are reported dead and more than 160 injured.","date":"","full_text":"An intense thunderstorm swept over Russia’s capital city Monday.

After moving four times to accommodate its expanding business, Haslam’s, which is still run by members of the family, now takes up about three-quarters of a city block and offers upwards of 300,000 new and used titles. Rumor has it that in the 1950s, Jack Kerouac would visit when he was tipsy and surreptitiously place his books in more prominent positions on the shelves.\nCalled the “cultural heart and soul of Big Sur,” the Henry Miller Memorial Library was designated as such by Miller’s close friend Emil White a year after Miller’s death, in 1981. (Miller called Big Sur home between 1944 and 1962.) It encompasses a small coastal cabin, which White himself built in 1961, and the surrounding property.\nMiller disapproved of memorials, saying that they “defeated the purpose of a man’s life. Only by living your own life to the full can you honor the memory of someone.” Nevertheless, this bookstore/art gallery/event space has been a countercultural hub in Big Sur, regularly hosting musical performances, films, readings, and other events that honor Miller’s literary and artistic legacy.\nThe legendary City Lights Books, founded in 1953 by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Peter D. Martin, originally made a name for itself after Ferlinghetti published Allen Ginsburg’s Howl and Other Poems in 1956, prompting an obscenity trial the following year. (Ferlinghetti won.) Located at an intersection of the city’s North Beach and Chinatown neighborhoods, the store offers visiting book lovers three floors of bliss. City Lights was a hub of 1960s counterculture in San Francisco, and in 2001, the city made it an official historic landmark—the first time this designation was granted to a business, rather than a building. It’s a must-see for any bibliophile visiting the Bay Area.\nThe Tattered Cover itself has been an institution in the Denver area since 1971 and has expanded to four locations, but its flagship store has inhabited the 1896 Morey Mercantile building on the corner of downtown Denver’s 16th and Wynkoop Streets since 1994. Visitors can find an expansive selection of titles in a cozy setting that encourages lingering and browsing.\nLongtime Tattered Cover owner Joyce Meskis, who purchased the first store in 1974, is transitioning to a consulting role this year after passing the torch to new owners, but her impact on independent bookselling in the United States can’t be underestimated: she’s won multiple awards, including the Author’s Guild of America Award for Distinguished Service to the Literary Community.\nAfter opening in 1994 in the front section of the Bryant Building, a 1922 former Chevrolet dealership in Minneapolis’s Uptown neighborhood, Magers and Quinn eventually expanded to occupy the entire first floor. It has since taken over all three stories of the structure, securing its title as one of the largest independent booksellers in the Midwest.\nAside from carrying a plethora of new titles, Magers and Quinn prides itself on specializing in unusual and hard-to-find editions. Don’t miss the “rare and collectible” section—you never know what you might find.\nBuilt in 1822, this five-story former milking house is the perfect spot to peruse shelves upon shelves of used books, cozy up to a wood stove, or make friends with one of the resident cats. William and Lilla Baldwin established a used book and collectible business in nearby Wilmington, Delaware, in 1934, eventually moving their operation to “The Barn” in 1946, where it has resided ever since.

Here's their story.","date":"","full_text":"Coptic Christians in Egypt have been attacked while traveling on pilgrimages and bombed while praying on Palm Sunday, amid an accelerating series of attacks over the last decade. The interrelated challenges of violence, economics and discrimination have led to the increasing departure of Christians from the Middle East. For centuries they have been part of the rich religious diversity of the region.\nSo who are these people that National Geographic has called “The Forgotten Faithful”?\nCoptic history\nAmong the Christians of the Middle East, the largest number – some eight million or so – is made up of Egypt’s Copts. Since I first visited Egypt in the 1990s, I have been interested in this community and its contribution to pluralism.\nCopts are the indigenous Christian population of Egypt, who date back to the first decades following the life of Jesus Christ. The biblical Book of Acts tells how Jews from Egypt came to Jerusalem for the feast of Pentecost, a Jewish harvest festival that marked the birth of the Christian church merely weeks after Christ’s crucifixion. Many of these Egyptians took the message of Christianity back to their own country. Christian tradition holds that St. Mark, one of the early disciples of Jesus, became the first bishop of Egypt.\nBy the fourth century, the majority of Egyptians had embraced the Christian faith. Even after the Muslim conquest in the seventh century, the majority of Egyptians were still Christians. It was only during the Middle Ages that greater and greater numbers embraced Islam, and the Christian population dwindled.\nToday, Egyptian Christians make up approximately 5 to 10 percent of the Egyptian population. The word “Copt” is used for all Egyptian Christians. It is derived from an ancient Greek word that simply means “Egyptian.”\nCopts are fiercely proud of their Egyptian heritage that dates back to the age of the pyramids as early as 3000 B.C. The vast majority of Copts are members of the Coptic Orthodox Church, an independent church that arose in A.D. 451, long before the divide that created the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches in 1054.\nThe language of the Coptic Orthodox church service (or liturgy) used in daily worship is also known as Coptic. It is the original Egyptian language written in Greek script.\nCopts live throughout every corner of Egypt and at every socioeconomic level. One of Egypt’s richest men, Naguib Sawiris, is a Copt, and so are most of Cairo’s garbage collectors, the zabellin. Though Copts are largely indistinguishable from the Muslim majority, many are given tattoos of a cross on their wrists as children, signifying their permanent commitment to the community. In addition, Coptic women are unlikely to veil, making them stand out from Muslim women.\nThe head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, and the most significant Christian leader in Egypt, is the bishop of the See of St. Mark, known among Egyptians as the Coptic pope or patriarch. Today the Church is led by Pope Tawadros II, who studied pharmacy before deciding to pursue a religious career in the 1980s.\nReligious practice\nCopts practice a form of Christianity that hearkens back to the earliest traditions of the church.\nPope Tawadros and all of the bishops of the Coptic Orthodox Church begin their vocation as monks – celibate men living in seclusion in monasteries. The Coptic Orthodox Church is unique in its preference for placing monks in the highest positions of authority.\nIn fact, the world’s first Christian monks, St. Anthony and St. Paul, established their monasteries in the eastern desert of Egypt in the early fourth century. Both of these monasteries, and numerous others, continue to operate.\nIn his book “Desert Father,” Australian author James Cowan describes how the monastic tradition became an important support for Egyptian Christians under persecution and helped to preserve culture throughout the Christian world.\nModern-day Copts often visit the monasteries for spiritual guidance, community retreats and to rediscover their heritage.\nBut while Copts may go to the deserts of Egypt for their religious practice, most live in the cities among their Muslim compatriots. Their churches and community service organizations – and even Coptic news sites and media – contribute to the vibrancy of Egyptian social and intellectual life.\nPeter Makari, a church leader with extensive experience working with Coptic organizations, writes about the ways in which Copts have organized community initiatives, development projects and solidarity movements with fellow Egyptians to promote national unity and peace. Copts regularly celebrate feasts with Muslim leaders and host public dialogues with Muslim intellectuals and leaders.\nIn particular, Copts participated alongside their Muslim compatriots in the proteststhat brought down the authoritarian rule of former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.\nThe condition of Copts today\nNonetheless, Copts have faced systemic discrimination in employment and limitations on their ability to access public services and education ever since the establishment of the modern republic of Egypt in 1952.\nGoverning authorities made it very difficult for them to build or refurbish their churches. After the 2011 revolution, Copts initially enjoyed newfound freedoms to organize and voice their concerns about these practices.\nHowever, their aspirations were dashed when the Egyptian Armed Forces clashed with Coptic protesters in a deadly confrontation in October 2011. When subsequently the Muslim Brotherhood came to power in 2012, there was an attempt to push through a constitution that gave special powers to Islamic authorities. These developments seemed to undermine Copts’ ability to participate as equal citizens.\nMost Copts were therefore content to see the restoration of authoritarian rule under Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, who in 2014 introduced a new constitution that limits the role of Islam in Egyptian government.\nUnfortunately, the Coptic community has now become an easy target in the fight between al-Sisi and his Islamist enemies. Violent attacks on Copts have led them to flee certain areas of Egypt, such as Sinai, and there is a steady stream of Coptic emigration from Egypt.\nThis must concern all Egyptians, since the presence of Copts is essential to the health of intellectual, cultural and political life in the Middle East."},{"url":"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/transit-agency-santa-clara-train-run-u2-concert","title":"Transit Agency Shells Out $61,000 for U2 Concert","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"The latest in ongoing struggle with the local stadium. ","date":"","full_text":"Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, the public agency serving California’s southern Bay Area, is accustomed to losing money to Levi’s Stadium, new home of the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers.\n“When all goes well, the VTA loses $50,000 to $60,000 per event at Levi’s,” the San Francisco Chronicle reports, citing agency spokesperson Stacey Hendler Ross.\nBut last Wednesday’s U2 concert cost the agency an extra $61,000 for roughly an hour of service.

They’re using green techniques to keep the water from ever reaching the drain.","date":"","full_text":"When a hard rain falls on a city, it can turn quickly into an ecological disaster. That’s because in 775 mostly older cities where sanitary and storm water sewers are combined underground, the rushing stormwater often overwhelms treatment plants, forcing a stew of oil, brake dust, heavy metals, pet and human feces into nearby waterways. The resulting pollution can shut down beaches, enter the food chain and contaminate drinking supplies.\nThe traditional and costly remedy for the problem of “combined sewer overflow” has been to build underground tunnels or sinks to capture the excess. In large cities, such as St. Louis, such projects can total close to $5 billion. But engineers are discovering greener and often cheaper ways to prevent water flowing into storm drains by recreating (and in some cases improving upon) the earth’s natural filtering system.\nBasically, these cities are becoming better sponges.\n“We appeal for guidance to the ecosystems that are being taken away,” explains North Carolina State University professor Bill Hunt, a stormwater expert. “We build a constructed stormwater wetland that’s modeled on a naturally occurring wetland. It’s not a perfect cognate,” he says. “But it’s close.”\nThat’s a big change from the past. “The old approach was to get stormwater into the pipe and into the ground as fast as possible,” explains Jennifer Drake, who teaches at the University of Toronto’s Department of Civil Engineering: “But in nature, it’s a much slower process and the path is quite long, the water meanders so it doesn’t end up overwhelming a downstream river or flooding the banks. So we want to create porous places within a city to act like a sponge.”\nThese places include vegetated swales and bio-retention cells, fancy names for low tracts of land that collect and filter water, green streets and green roofs, rain gardens and rain barrels, bump-outs, infiltration galleries and pervious pavement. They are all designed to capture water and hold it until it until the water has either naturally percolated through the soil and been absorbed by plant roots or released into the atmosphere through the plants’ leaves, a process known as evapotranspiration.\nThe beauty of an intensive investment in green infrastructure is that the impact goes well beyond curbing stormwater flow. Green roofs, road gullies, curbside bio-retention plots and swales planted with trees and flowers and designed to hold water while it seeps into the ground, not only clean the water, but provide carbon sequestration, which helps slow global warming and combat urban heat islands, where temperatures can be as much as 5 degrees higher than the surrounding countryside.\n“You’re creating urban habitats,” says Drake, “so you’re also making pollinating spaces for bees, and public spaces that are beneficial for mental health.”\nHere are five cities using innovative green technology to manage stormwater runoff before it ever hits the drain:\nChicago — A 55-gallon rain barrel might not solve the world’s stormwater runoff problems, since a 1,000-square-foot roof delivers more than 10 times that much water from a 1-inch rain. But rain barrels are still a vital tool, which is why the city spent $6 million over two years to give away 123,000 rain barrels to its customers. “It’s the gateway drug into storm water management because it gets people thinking about water and thinking about managing water,” says Hunt at North Carolina State University.\nThe key, notes David St. Pierre, executive director of Chicago’s Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, is to encourage people to “disconnect” by removing their downspout from that direct connection to a main sewer line. “If you can take these direct stormwater connections out of system, that’s your highest return on investment,” he says. And while “it might be a rain barrel today, tomorrow it could be a 500-gallon cistern included underneath every new home, so that people could reuse their stormwater runoff in a very significant way.”\nFayetteville, N.C. — This eastern North Carolina city, home of Fort Bragg, took a dilapidated, two-block slice of downtown already slated for revitalization and turned it into the state’s first fully developed green street. A “road diet” eliminated three superfluous lanes, allowing a wider sidewalk and the creation of 13 sunken “landscape islands,” where water enters through a break in the curbing. The islands are filled with 3 feet of “expensive dirt mixed with sand and organic topsoil,” explains city engineer Giselle Rodriguez, who shepherded the project last year. Interlocking concrete pavers were put down in some parking areas, which also allow water to drain into the ground.\nThe goal of the $1.3 million project: to permit 85 percent of rainwater to drain into the ground instead of nearby Blounts Creek, where it would normally run. And it seems to work. Rodriguez says the green street was “able to tolerate Hurricane Matthew’s 15 inches of rain without a problem.”\nPhiladelphia — The nation’s fifth-largest city announced plans to spend $2.5 billion from 2011 to 2036 to turn 10,000 acres into green spaces. That includes one-third of the impervious areas in the older, urban core, which has a combined sewer and stormwater system. By doing so, the city hopes eventually to cut stormwater pollution in local rivers and waterways by 85 percent.\nBut that’s not all. As part of its stormwater management program, the city helps subsidize residents who want to replace their water-shedding driveways and concrete patios, with porous pavers. Philadelphia is also one of the few municipalities with a separate stormwater fee based on the percentage of a property’s impervious surface. New developments the size of three townhouse lots or bigger are required to put systems in place that will guarantee the capture of the first inch of any stormwater runoff.\nOak Creek, Wis. — You’ve heard of highly efficient homes with net-zero energy use. Why not highly efficient developments with net-zero stormwater use? The town of Oak Creek, a few miles south of Milwaukee on Lake Michigan, did just that with its 2016 Drexel Town Square development. The 85-acre site, a former Delphi Automotive plant, already had a large wetlands area, although it was dominated by cattails and red canary grass, an invasive species. So Sue Winnen, an environmental engineer for the town, decided to turn it into a “fully functioning wetland, with flowers and pollinators and birds, something that would soak up the water and hold it, while slowly releasing it into the ground.”\nOld parking lots were replaced with pervious pavers set on top of stone. After a rain, says Winnen, you can feel the water under the pavers as you walk on them. And a sloped parking lot sends that runoff into three bioswales on the opposite corner from the wetlands. The result: Despite a very wet spring, says Winnen, the amount of water flowing out of the entire development’s sole drainage pipe is the equivalent of a few garden hoses of water.\nToronto — North America’s first green roof bylaw took effect in Toronto in 2010 for commercial and residential buildings that had more than 20,000 square feet of floor space. Depending on the size of the building, anywhere from 20 to 60 percent of the available roof space must become a green roof, outfitted with a waterproof membrane, a growing medium, and plants. By the end of 2016, some 400 green roofs had either been built or were in the permitting process, covering the equivalent of about 60 NFL football fields.\n“There’s not a sea of green roofs yet, just a patch here and a patch there,” says Jane Welsh, the team lead for environmental policy in the Toronto planning department, looking out over Canada’s largest city from her office on the 22nd floor. “But we get excited, of course. And there’s a very strong perceptual flavor that you’re starting to feel that Toronto is a green city.”"},{"url":"https://www.devex.com/news/5-climate-smart-investments-90365","title":null,"author_text":null,"keywords":null,"publication_text":null,"description":null,"date":"","full_text":"Rising temperatures and sea levels have long been issues that global development stakeholders have sought to tackle, most recently with renewed impetus thanks to the Paris climate agreement.

While more students in recent years have been enrolling in postsecondary institutions, the U.S. has struggled to enable more to graduate with a bachelor’s or associate’s degree. According to one respected tally, just under 55 percent of students who entered college in 2010 had earned degrees after six years – an increase of two percentage points since 2009.\nFor higher education institutions to continue at that pace or boost it, they’ll need to find new ways of educating a student body increasingly composed of people who are the first in their family to enter college. And because those students tend to have fewer financial resources, colleges may feel pressure to expend more resources to help students handle the costs of college.\n“Well prepared, well resourced, full-pay students: Those are the students all institutions want because they help them meet their bottom line,” said Joe Garcia, president of the organization that released Tuesday’s report, the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education. “But there are fewer and fewer of those students as a percentage of the total.”\nThough the country’s number of high school graduates grew by 30 percent between 1995 and 2013, to 3.47 million students, by next year colleges will see a high school graduating cohort that is smaller by 81,000 students – a dip of 2.3 percent. After a few years of some growth, the report projects that from 2027 to 2032 the annual graduation totals will each be smaller by 150,000 to 220,000 people than the ones the nation had in 2013.\nFueling the decline will be decreases in the overall student population and growth among specific student groups. According to the report:\nThe number of Latinos graduating from high school is projected to reach 920,000 students by 2025 – an increase by 50 percent since 2014.\nThe Asian-American and Pacific Islander student body is set to increase by 30 percent from 2013 to the early 2030s, reaching nearly 60,000 graduates.\nThe number of whites is slated to decline by 14 percent between 2013 and 2030.\nThe decline in black high school graduates is anticipated to be 6 percent between 2012 – when 480,000 graduated – and 2032.\n“Graduation rates have not dipped” in the projections, Demaree Michelau, one of the report’s co-authors, wrote in an email. The projected enrollment declines are “related to overall declines in births and student enrollments in K-12.”\nRegions will show wide differences in graduating high school students, the report forecast. Southern and western states, which combined already represent 72 percent of the nation’s high school graduates, will increase their share by a few points in the next two decades – though the total number of graduates in western states is anticipated to dip. The Midwest, however, is set to lose 93,000 graduates – a decline of 19 percent. Similar projections are forecast for the Northeast, which is slated to lose 72,000 graduates.\nIn Texas, which the report considers a southern state, only 56 percent of high school graduates go to college. “It’s a number that has to increase tremendously,” said William Serrata, the president of El Paso Community College. The national average is nearly 70 percent.\nSerrata said some innovations have been shown to help. For example, students in dual-enrollment courses, which allow high school students to take college-level courses for course credit, enter a postsecondary institution 80 percent of the time in the El Paso area. That’s 30 percentage points higher than students who don’t enroll in dual-credit classes.\nPolicymakers and university presidents “should not come away with the sense that this is hopeless, that institutions are going to close, and that we’re not going to meet our workforce needs,” began Garcia. But, he added, “if institutions continue to do the things they’ve always done, but with a different population, they’re going to have worse results, lower enrollment, and they’re going lose them to other institutions that are more forward-looking and more progressive.”\nGarcia also cautioned that the report shouldn’t be used to censure universities that are increasing capacity for additional students. California, for example, is enduring a space crunch due to the popularity of its colleges, and is so far behind in providing seats for students that the prospect of a downturn in high school graduates won’t allay the current building boom, he said.\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

King, Texas Perspectives\nIn opinion polls, election results, television viewing habits and social media chatter, we can see the increasing polarization among us. Practically all explanations for this increased polarization revolve around social and political factors. These factors are important, but they don’t tell the entire story.\nCivilizations rise and fall, and it is important to have context for how they evolve over time. Part of this context relates to understanding what we can choose to avoid versus what we can’t avoid no matter what we choose.\nThe classic example of the rise and fall of a civilization is the Roman Empire. As the empire expanded, it brought prosperity to Romans at the expense of those in the newly conquered provinces. This expansion continued until control of new territories became too burdensome. The size of the empire was self-limiting largely because of diminishing returns on the acquisition of more natural resources.\nSome scholars say the U.S. today parallels the Roman Empire, and I agree. There are parallels from resource constraints, and we must heed the implications.\nThere were three phases of progression of the U.S. economy between 1947 and 2012. The three phases are distinguished by the changing rates of U.S. power consumption; the cost of food, energy and water; and distinct changes in structural indicators.\nBefore the 1970s, when power consumption was increasing rapidly and energy and food were becoming cheaper, the U.S. economy distributed money more evenly across all economic sectors as it grew rapidly. After 2002, when power consumption was stagnant and energy and food became more expensive, the U.S. economy distributed money less evenly as it acquired high quantities of debt and grew much more slowly. In between the 1960s and 2002 was an intermediate transition affected by both energy constraints (e.g., Arab oil embargo and Iran Revolution) and social changes (e.g., reduction of union and other labor power).\nThe more energy you have and the cheaper it is, the easier it is to expand and distribute. Both higher power consumption and cheaper energy, along with food, are associated with increasingly uniform distribution of money among economic sectors. The corollary is that if the U.S. is not consuming energy at a higher rate, and if we’re not making energy and food substantially cheaper, then we might expect it to be harder to distribute proceeds.\nEnergy and food costs have declined tremendously since World War II, but since 2002, that hasn’t been the case. This change in trend is new, unprecedented and unappreciated. Food and energy will never compose zero percent of our spending, so they cannot decrease in cost forever. Physical resource constraints eventually get translated into economic constraints. It is irresponsible for us to assume the social changes are not influenced and governed by these constraints.\nThese physical constraints help explain the increase in polarization. As many citizens were excluded from global prosperity, it was easier to take an “us” (excluded Americans) versus “them” (bankers, China, the elite, etc.) mentality. During the last election, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders each had a base of “us” with many common members, but with a more dissimilar group of “them” to attack. Before the fall of Rome, warring factions of politicians emerged, no longer working together. Since 2008, Congress has passed very little legislation, much less bipartisan.\nWe can’t legislate changes to the energy supply and assume they can always overcome physical challenges, just like the Roman Senate couldn’t just tell the army to take over new territory like the “good ol’ days.” Consider the Renewable Fuels Standard. Policymakers, economists and Silicon Valley venture capitalists thought the production of more than 30 billion gallons per year of liquid biofuels was simply a matter of human effort and ingenuity. It wasn’t, and it isn’t. On the fossil side, while Trump’s aim to bring back coal helped get him elected, it cannot “make America great again.”\nWe must recognize and accept that physical constraints do govern our lives, and that we can choose to change how to distribute our wealth as a separate goal to increasing overall wealth. One way to do this is to reward business and political leaders who accept and plan for, rather than deny, such constraints.\nCarey W.

It gives the user, in this theoretical case, the Iranian government, access to all information flowing through the system - potentially allowing it to access the private emails and internet history of every citizen in the country.\nUgo Santillo told Al Jazeera's reporter that he was happy to make the 20 million euro ($21.2m) deal happen.\n\"Fortunately, we have a sister company, RESi,\" Santillo said. \"RESi sells some software analytics for, statistics for traffic congestion.\"\nAnalysis: Citizens pay cost of illegal spyware trade\nHe explained that by using RESi, he could describe the product as a simple traffic management system on the export paperwork - and not mention the spyware capability - to avoid strict surveillance export regulations.\nAl Jazeera showed the undercover video to export compliance lawyer Charles Giacoma who suggested that RESi would not get a licence to ship to Iran and that any attempt to circumvent EU regulation 428 on dual-use items involved the commission of a crime with the possibility of a prison sentence of five to 10 years.\nIn response to these allegations, the RESi Group told Al Jazeera they operate with full respect of the regulations. They also said they had been aware of the identity of Al Jazeera's undercover reporter. They said they had only met him because they believed he might be working for a competitor.\nThey added, \"We had no intention of completing this or any deal with the individual our staff met with. Any deal that we may have discussed with him would have to be dependent on obtaining the full legal authorisation from the authorities.\"\nSide-stepping restrictions\nIt was the same game - with different players - when Al Jazeera's undercover reporter approached another Italian surveillance giant, AREA.\nOn this occasion, the undercover reporter claimed to be acting on behalf of the government South Sudan which has a well-documented record of human rights abuse.\nThis time, the reporter was seeking to acquire IMSI-catchers - suitcase-sized surveillance boxes that act as dummy mobile phone towers, sucking up information from all nearby devices. They are powerful surveillance tools, heavily restricted to law-enforcement and intelligence agencies.\nAREA Vice President Marco Braccioli explained to the undercover reporter that securing IMSI export licences for South Sudan is a slow process. As a theoretical solution, he explained a typical industry work-around: launder the sale via a third-party.\nEXPLAINER: What is electronic surveillance?\n\"If I have an end user statement, signed in Tanzania, and then if Tanzania give this system, as a gift, to South Sudan, (this) is something I can't control as a company,\" Braccioli said on hidden camera.\nIn order to facilitate the transaction, he suggested that Al Jazeera's reporter deal directly with his Turkish spyware manufacturer, BTT, and connected the reporter to BTT cofounder, Alper Tosun.\nOnce again, the \"dual-use\" method was proposed as a means of fast tracking the sale - and sidestepping export restrictions.\n\"Yeah, I say this is dual-use telecom equipment, okay,\" Touson said on hidden camera. \"And most of the time, it is a telecom-testing equipment. This is the main purpose that I am declaring.\"\nAs with IPS's \"traffic management system\", BTT was proposing to simply not mention in export paperwork that the equipment was capable of spying on civilians.\n\"Anything which is considered to be dual-use, which is our case, because my equipment is actually a telecommunication, okay,\" Tosun told the reporter. \"I don't want to mention the software side, but actually, it's a box where you can make calls through it.\"\nAl Jazeera approached BTT for comment on Tosun's proposal, but they did not provide a response.\nWhen AREA was asked to comment on its role in this proposed transaction, the surveillance company said it \"works with the relevant governments to ensure the proper export and legal use of our equipment.\"\nAREA added that they wouldn't be able to comment further until they had seen the material secretly recorded by Al Jazeera.\nFalsifying documents\nAnother deal featured in Spy Merchants concerned the proposed acquisition of 10 military-grade IMSI-catchers.\nThis time, Al Jazeera's undercover reporter told the manufacturer that his clients wanted to remain anonymous. That meant that the surveillance provider, China-based manufacturer Semptian, would have no way of knowing if the IMSIs were being ordered by criminals or even \"terrorists\".\nSemptian founder Frank Feng said on undercover camera, \"We don't know who is the end user. And we don't care. We have done it before.\"\nBut in China, selling this powerful equipment raises enough red flags that Semptian proposed a \"dual-use\" ruse of its own.\n\"Nobody really will say this is an IMSI-catcher. We only say this is a wi-fi router,\" said Semptian's Senior Product Manager Paul Liang, referring to the IMSI-catcher he had delivered to the Al Jazeera's reporter's hotel room for him to inspect. \"So we just apply for the Chinese government that this is the router, so that's okay, you can sell it.\"\n\"Basically, you falsify the documents, the shipping documents?,\" asked Al Jazeera's undercover reporter. \"And you say this is not what it is?\"\n\"Yeah. Actually, you don't know what this is at all. You see this wi-fi router.\"\nThe Semptian representatives said on hidden camera that they would ensure that any evidence of the origin of the spyware would be eliminated.\n\"We wipe everything,\" they said.\nSemptian did not respond to a request for comment.\nSpy Merchants can be viewed on Al Jazeera:\nMonday, April 10 - 20:00 GMT\nTuesday, April 11 - 12:00 GMT\nWednesday, April 12 - 01:00 GMT\nThursday, April 12 - 06:00 GMT\nFriday, April 14 - 12:00 GMT\nSaturday, April 15 - 20:00 GMT\nSunday, April 16 - 01:00 GMT\nMonday, April 17 - 06:00 GMT\nSource: Al Jazeera"},{"url":"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865681449/Sen-Mike-Lee-Trumps-decision-to-kill-the-Clean-Power-Plan-put-Provo-before-Paris.html","title":"Sen.

Meeting the emissions reduction targets President Obama agreed to in Paris would have been impossible without it.\nSo as soon as President Trump killed the Clean Power Plan back in March, he also functionally killed the Paris Accord. Both actions, contrary to the lamentations of our liberal elite, are fantastic news for the American people.\nAccording to The New York Times, President Obama’s Clean Power Plan would have “closed hundreds of coal-fired power plants” and “frozen construction of new plants.” Since coal provides approximately 40 percent of America’s electricity, and 75 percent of Utah’s, these new regulations would have raised electricity costs, sending shockwaves through the U.S. economy.\nConsumers would have been forced to pay more to cool and heat their homes, leaving less to spend on groceries and mortgages. Businesses would have been forced to raise prices, lower wages or invest less in order to pay their higher power bills. As a result, NERA Economic Consulting estimated that the Clean Power Plan would have cost the U.S. economy over $40 billion annually.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done\nAnd for what? Even if the Clean Power Plan had been implemented to perfection, climate activists admit it would have lowered global temperatures by just .02 degrees Celsius over the span of one hundred years.\nOf course, if you are a billionaire hedge fund manager or a famous Hollywood actor, you probably wouldn’t notice if your power bill went up a couple of hundred dollars a month, or your latte cost an extra $1.\nBut if you aren’t wealthy and famous, if you are a low- or middle-income American, then the economic costs of the Clean Power Plan would hit a lot closer to home.\nThis is exactly why President Obama’s push for a carbon regulation scheme failed in Congress in 2010. Faced with an honest debate the American people wisely chose not to gamble with their household budgets for speculative environmental benefits.\nAfter losing fair and square, President Obama abandoned the democratic process and pursued his climate priorities through executive fiat. He twisted the Clean Air Act to enact policies the law was never intended to allow. Then he ran to the international community seeking a blessing of legitimacy that the American people never gave him.\nPresident Obama never submitted his Paris Accord to the United States Senate as the Constitution requires for treaties. Instead he hoped that future presidents would bow to foreign pressure and go along with an international regulatory regime the American people never approved.\nThe 2016 election was about many things, perhaps none greater than the growing sense among Americans that our political elites were working for themselves and their foreign counterparts instead of for the American people. For all of Donald Trump’s flaws as a candidate, the American people elected him to, as he said, “put America first” again. The American people care — deeply — about our environment, and they are perfectly capable of protecting it, both privately and when necessary through government policy. But those decisions are not for a single politician, and certainly not a committee of foreign dignitaries we never elected, to make.\nAgree with his decision or not, President Trump stood up last Thursday for the Constitution and the citizens it protects. And we are all better off that he did.\nMike Lee is the junior U.S. senator from Utah."},{"url":"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/will-one-companys-mixed-mission-yemen-sow-suspicion-aid-groups","title":"Will one company’s mixed mission in Yemen sow suspicion of aid groups?","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"PBS NewsHour","description":"For aid organizations, especially those in conflict zones, remaining politically neutral is crucial for trust.

They say it’s the only way they can safely do their jobs.\nBut a recent investigation by The New York Times reveals how one company may have endangered that neutrality for many humanitarian groups.\nWilliam Brangham has that story.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: UNICEF and the Red Cross are two of the humanitarian groups working in Yemen, where a brutal civil war has killed or injured at least 12,000 people.\nThe Times today revealed that a logistics company known as Transoceanic Development wasn’t only helping those aid groups get their supplies into Yemen, but the company was also secretly helping U.S. special forces do the same. The Times reports how this dual relationship could drive suspicion that the aid groups were somehow acting as agents of the U.S. government.\nI’m joined now by Eric Schmitt. He’s one of The Times’ reporters who broke this story. And by Daryl Grisgraber. She’s a senior advocate at Refugees International, which is an aid group that operates in the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. She previously worked for Amnesty International.\nWelcome to you both.\nEric Schmitt, I would like to start with you.\nLet’s just go over some of these details again. So this logistics company, Transoceanic Development, is working to deliver and help deliver aid supplies to Yemen for these aid groups, while they’re also doing some work for U.S. special forces.\nCan you explain those two relationships a little bit?\nERIC SCHMITT, The New York Times: Right.\nSo, Transoceanic is this giant global logistics company. And its job is really to ferry materials and shipments all over the world for various customers. And a couple of its customers, as you mentioned, are the Red Cross and for UNICEF. And, in this case, they did some warehousing, they did some basic bringing materials and shipments of supplies into Yemen that would then be delivered to — through other humanitarian organizations to the needy in that strife-torn country.\nSo that’s one of their jobs. And they were very open about this. And when Mr. Darden was kidnapped, his story became quite public, because …\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is the main, the central character in your story, who was sort of organizing this organization in Yemen. He was kidnapped by some rebels there, and then was released after several years.\nERIC SCHMITT: That’s right. Scott Darden was the country director for Transoceanic. So, he was responsible kind of at the front end for getting these shipments of aid into Yemen. So, that story is quite public.\nWhat’s new here is that it turned out that Transoceanic and Mr. Darden were also working on secret contracts involving shipping similar types of materials into Yemen for the military, specifically for the very specialized special operations forces, the commandos, who are operating in Yemen today.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: And just for the record, there’s no evidence that the aid groups had any idea that the company they were hiring to do work for them was also doing this work for the U.S. government.\nERIC SCHMITT: That’s right.\nSpokesmen for both UNICEF and for the Red Cross said they had no idea that Transoceanic was carrying out these kind of contracts with the military on the logistics side of things. And had they known, they may have opted for another company.\nBut I must say, there aren’t a lot of companies that get into these kind of very dangerous war zone type of places. So it’s not unusual to find a company like Transoceanic dealing with multiple kinds of customers.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, Daryl Grisgraber, what is your reaction? You read this story. What was your response?\nDARYL GRISGRABER, Refugees International: Initially, we were all quite dismayed as humanitarians, because there’s meant to be a very strict separation between military assistance, political assistance, and humanitarian assistance.\nAnd there is quite a lively debate that goes on right now in the humanitarian world about keeping those separate and when and how is it possible to combine them.\nBut the initial reaction then is, because these got combined, it’s going to look bad for humanitarians everywhere. Humanitarians tend to be a little bit under suspicion anyway, just because they’re foreigners often in a country, where we talk about the U.N. or big INGOs.\nAnd they operate very significantly on trust, building trust with the people they serve, as well as the governments that allow them to operate. And to know now that the humanitarian principle of neutrality in particular has potentially been compromised or even perceived to be compromised is going to affect all humanitarians.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, the concern, just to spell it out even more clearly, is that if a government or groups operating in a certain country somehow thought that you were receiving shipments from a company that was also working for a partisan group in that nation as well, that the humanitarian aid workers might come under attack.\nDARYL GRISGRABER: Oh, for sure, yes.\nOrganizations could be banned from operating in a country. The humanitarian individuals could come under attack. And, in general, it’s really important to remember that this just erodes the trust that allows humanitarians to do work everywhere and get access to the people who really need them the most, because that often involves really emphasizing the fact that you are neutral and not on the side of a conflict, and so it’s OK for you to be serving people.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: Eric Schmitt, in your piece you remind us that there was a more notorious incident where the CIA was operating in Pakistan, and it literally did blur these very lines that we’re talking about. Can you tell us what happened in that story?\nERIC SCHMITT: Sure, absolutely.\nIn an effort to try and determine whether Osama bin Laden was actually hiding in a walled compound in Abbottabad, in this town in Pakistan, they devised a system where they would go door-to-door in that city and do inoculations, and hoping that somebody would come to the door, they would be able to come inside, take inoculations from presumably family members, and then get some type of DNA readout on this.\nWell, this all came to light, of course, after the death of bin Laden, and it very much jeopardized not only the doctors that were involved, but it basically turned much of that community in Pakistan against polio vaccinations.\nSo, it became — actually, it was very counterproductive for public health reasons in that country. And the CIA has said it won’t do that again.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: Daryl Grisgraber, what do you — what is your sense of what revelations like this could do for the effort in Yemen right now?\nDARYL GRISGRABER: Well, there are very few aid groups, relatively speaking, operating in Yemen as it is because of the security situation.\nThere are many U.N. agencies and INGOs, international non-governmental organizations, that had to withdraw their staff. And so compared to the need in Yemen, there are really very few groups addressing it.\nAnd if this breaks trust or puts humanitarian under fire in some way, it will be completely comprehensible that organizations pull their staffs out of there. But that means even less help for — what are we talking at, at this point? Potentially, 17 million people might begin starving to death in a few weeks.\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Daryl Grisgraber, Eric Schmitt, thank you both very much.\nDARYL GRISGRABER: Thank you.\nERIC SCHMITT: Thank you."},{"url":"http://khn.org/news/a-community-seeks-answers-assurances-about-health-care-in-10-languages","title":"A Community Seeks Answers, Assurances About Health Care — In 10 Languages","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Kaiser Health News","description":"A forum for Asian immigrants in Oakland draws a crowd so large some attendees had to be seated in an overflow room. Many immigrants are eager for information relevant to them as changes to the health care system are debated in Washington.","date":"2017-06-05","full_text":"OAKLAND, Calif. — Ten years ago, Mary Thach unexpectedly needed throat surgery to improve her breathing and spent two weeks in the hospital. Her bill: $69,000.\nHer first reaction was panic, said Thach, speaking through a Vietnamese interpreter. Uninsured at the time, she had no idea how to come up with the money. Then she learned from the hospital staff that as a low-income legal resident, she qualified for Medicaid, which ultimately paid the bill.\nAt a recent community meeting in this city, the 54-year-old Alameda resident teared up as she expressed her fear of losing Medicaid (known as Medi-Cal in California) under the Republican-sponsored American Health Care Act. The Congressional Budget Office estimates could lead to the loss of health coverage for 23 million Americans.\n“I’m scared that Mr. Trump will cut Medi-Cal. How will I take care of my health?” Thach said.\nFacing concerns over immigration and GOP-led efforts to dismantle the Obama administration’s signature health care law and cut Medicaid, community groups in Oakland, Bakersfield, Fresno, Houston and other cities with large immigrant populations are holding meetings to allay fears, debunk myths and inform people of their rights.\nMore than 400 people attended the Oakland forum on Wednesday sponsored by the Oakland-based clinic system Asian Health Services. Some came to ask questions, others to share stories they hoped would motivate elected officials to help them. The room was so packed, a group of Chinese attendees had to observe from an overflow room. Most participants were middle-aged or senior citizens, many with notebooks and pens in hand.\nWith the help of headphones and a tableful of interpreters, the meeting was translated in 10 different Asian languages, including Cantonese, Mandarin, Mongolian and Korean and Tagalog. Questions were fielded by Asian Health Services staff, local politicians and an immigration attorney, who gave advice on interacting with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials.\nSome attendees feared the use of government programs like Medi-Cal and CalFresh (food stamps) could prompt ICE inquiries or deportation. The attorney, Nancy Wong with Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach, said she’d seen no evidence of that and urged the audience to continue using those programs for now.\nRepublican Congress members from California contend the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — is failing and has raised costs to the point that care has become out-of-reach for many Americans.\nDevin Nunes (R-Tulare) who supports the GOP replacement bill, favors moving people from the “broken” Medi-Cal program “into better, private coverage plans.” The GOP’s AHCA would reduce federal funding for Medicaid by $834 billion from 2017 to 2026, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.\nMany Americans are concerned about major changes to their health coverage, organizers said, but members of Oakland’s Asian immigrant community face additional language, cultural, legal and other barriers to getting the health care they need.\nSome at the forum feared that a preexisting condition, or being an immigrant — even a legal one — would disqualify them from future health coverage and other public benefits. In most cases, adults without authorization to live in the U.S. cannot qualify for full Medi-Cal coverage, although permanent residents with green cards can. Children in California whose families meet income limits can receive Medi-Cal regardless of their immigration status.\n“Many of you went from worrying … that insurers would not cover you to overnight being entitled to full benefits,” Sherry Hirota, CEO of Asian Health Services, told the audience. “We can’t roll back, and we can’t let immigrants be criminalized for using health services. That’s why we’re here.”\nHirota said the ACA, including the expansion of Medicaid, allowed her clinic system to treat more than 9,000 new patients. More than 90 percent of the center’s patients are on Medi-Cal, she said.\n“More [forums like these] are emerging, and they’re important because there are many questions and not enough information out there,” said Doreena Wong, a project director with Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Los Angeles.\nThe organization has helped put together similar informational events about health care and immigration in Spanish and Asian languages in Los Angeles and Orange counties.\nCary Sanders, director of policy analysis for the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, an advocacy group, said the difficulty is that immigrants historically have been excluded from certain government health programs.\n“California has certainly gone much further than other states to expand health care for immigrant communities,” Sanders said. “For certain groups, it’s still very difficult. They may only be eligible for emergency care. Because of that people often delay care. They have to use home remedies to limp along to take care of and manage health problems that, if left untreated, can become a lot more serious.”\nAt the forum, Alameda County Supervisor Wilma Chan pointed out that Asians make up close to 30 percent of the population in her county. Together with Latinos, they comprise more than half.\nShe asked that people not be afraid to access health care services or make use of any other public benefit.\n“There is this idea that if you’re not a citizen, you can be deported if you go to a clinic or use food stamps … this has not happened,” Chan said.\nOne woman said her friends have encouraged her to stop using CalFresh to draw less attention to her family. A man asked whether paying cash at the clinic instead of using his Medi-Cal coverage would be safer for his mixed-status family.\nMandy Xue of Alameda was grateful for the meeting even though her concern had little to do with the goings-on in Washington. She learned two weeks ago at her son’s dentist’s office that his Medi-Cal coverage had ended. When she called the state for an explanation, she was told there was no record of her or her 13-year-old son, even though the Alameda resident says they have been covered since she was pregnant with him.\nXue, 45, was not sure what to do, and worried that she and her son would not be able to continue seeing their doctors.\nThe event was “very helpful,” Xue said through a Cantonese translator, because now “I know what the next step should [be] and what should I look for.”\nNgoc Nguyen, editor of California Ethnic Media Partnerships, contributed to this story.\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation."},{"url":"http://www.postcrescent.com/story/life/2017/05/28/mental-health-addiction-often-dual-fight/101543920","title":"Mental health, addiction often a dual fight","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Post-Crescent Media","description":"We underestimate how deep this problem is and the true costs of dual diagnoses.","date":"","full_text":"Each year millions of Americans face the reality of living with a mental health condition. One in five Americans will be affected by a mental health condition in their lifetime — and every American is affected or impacted through their friends and family.\nAccording to the Journal of American Medical Association, 50 percent of the people who have a severe mental condition also have a substance abuse problem. JAMA also found that 37 percent of alcoholics have a mental illness, as do 53 percent of drug addicts.\nI believe the numbers might be even higher than JAMA predictions.\nDual diagnosis is very common with the patients in our groups. We often need to treat the addiction first before we can help patients deal with their mental health issues. The first thing we need to do is to clear their minds. It often takes 30 days just to help them feel better so we can help them seek the kind of mental health resources they might need.\nI work with two groups — each with eight people. Recovery planning requires exploring six dimensions of the wellness wheel: Physical, Intellectual, Emotional, Social, Occupational and Spiritual. Each person keeps a planner that they need to update each week demonstrating how they have touched at least three dimensions, three times each week. So, they may have started a new exercise routine, started volunteering for a nonprofit and participated in new social situations. This is a six-week program. Our goal is to help them get balance in their lives so they can achieve success.\nI see patients twice each week during the program, and provide additional support once they graduate. In addition to the six weeks of group, I also conduct three individual sessions to address issues that are not group fodder. After the six-week group, patients do “step down” treatment called, “Continuing Care For 8 More Weeks,” but it is less intensive (two-hour sessions, once per week).\nLong-term recovery requires ongoing support. We encourage them to do things they don’t want to do each day. Little by little, they begin to change their behaviors and turn their lives around.\nMany people who are in the program have been in previous treatment programs. There is so much public shame for those who seek long-term recovery. The government has no idea how deep this problem is and what the true costs of dual diagnoses are in our communities. The individuals who need treatment the most continue to churn between addiction and mental health because there isn’t enough support or education about the issue. They have become so used to using drugs or alcohol for self-medication to address mental health issues like anxiety or depression that it’s very difficult to break the cycle without serious intervention.\nTreatment options vary state by state and county by county. Some counties, like Outagamie, Winnebago and Dane, have good services for those seeking treatment. Other counties, particularly in rural areas of the state, have few treatment options. We need to make it easier for people who have a problem to get the treatment they need.\nI’m concerned about the mixed messages about substances and mental health. One example is legalizing marijuana throughout the country. There are serious consequences for heavy marijuana use. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana affects brain development. When people use marijuana regularly, the drug may reduce thinking, memory and learning functions. Marijuana's effects on these abilities may last a long time or even be permanent. There have also been increases in fatal car crashes due to marijuana use in states like Washington and Colorado that have legalized the practice.\nWhat kind of message are we sending to our children? We should be educating people about the risks and importance of preventing drug and alcohol use. Instead, we’re making it easier for addictive personalities to have access to dangerous substances.\nI speak from experience. I am in long-term recovery myself (nine years clean). This is an issue I’m very passionate about and I am doing everything I can to lead others to wellness.\nJerome Mutchie is a clinical substance abuse counselor for ThedaCare Behavioral Health in Menasha."},{"url":"http://www.hcn.org/articles/why-the-endangered-species-act-cant-save-the-vanishing-whitebark-pine","title":"Why the Endangered Species Act can’t save whitebark pines","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Politics, money and climate change threaten one of the West’s iconic trees.","date":"","full_text":"U.S. Forest Service research ecologist Bob Keane has studied whitebark pine, a coniferous tree of the high country, for more than thirty years. Still, when asked to describe a whitebark to someone who’s never seen one, he takes a breath and pauses for a moment. “Gosh,” he says.\nThe shape of the tree is very distinctive, Keane says. Instead of growing cone-shaped like other conifers, whitebarks branch like hardwoods. “A lot of the undergrowth is very small, so you see these open park-like stands of beautiful spreading trees,” he says. This shape is an adaptation that shows Clark’s nutcrackers flying past that a tree below has many nutritious cones and might be worth a travel stop.\nClark’s nutcrackers cache thousands of whitebark seeds, dispersing the pine across the high country, where the tree is a keystone species. Whitebark pine is one of the first trees to break ground after a fire, thanks to those nutcrackers, and it stabilizes soil and snowpacks at timberline. Living a millennium or more, whitebarks shape the West’s high mountain ecology in countless ways.\nBut the whitebark is going extinct and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the agency) hasn’t given the species federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. In April 2017, two conservation organizations from Montana lost a lawsuit against the agency for its failure to list the pine. No one – not the plaintiffs, defendants, or panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals – questioned the precariousness of the tree’s fate. At question was how the agency prioritized which species it protects. Species, the court ruled, could be passed over because the agency didn’t have the necessary funds. As the story of whitebarks demonstrates, extinction has as much to do with politics as it does with biology.\nThe whitebark pine is an iconic tree of the West’s high mountains, ranging from Wyoming’s southern Wind Rivers to northern Alberta and British Columbia. In the fall, in a whitebark pine forest, “there are tons of cones and it is alive with animals, just alive,” Keane says. “You don’t see that with subalpine firs.” Researchers have found that whitebark cones feed more than 100 animal species and, in Glacier National Park, 40 percent of the understory plants in whitebark pine communities grow only there. The tree’s fatty, protein-rich seeds are an important food for Greater Yellowstone grizzlies; when the seeds run short, the bears eat more meat.\nThe whitebark pine faces intertwined threats that have killed the trees across much of their historic range. In 1910, Gifford Pinchot imported white pine blister rust, a fast-moving European fungal disease that kills whitebarks, to the West in a tree shipment.\nAnd a century of fire suppression has imperiled whitebarks, too. The shade-intolerant trees rely on fire to open areas; without fires, trees such as subalpine firs shade out whitebarks. Often, Keane says, permanently stunted pines linger in the shadows of those new neighbors. “You’ll see an overstory of subalpine fir, but an understory of tiny whitebark pine saplings that are probably older than the canopy,” he says.\nMeanwhile, native mountain pine beetles have taken out swaths of whitebark pines weakened by overcrowding and drought; a 2009 beetle outbreak killed whitebarks across more than 3,000 square miles. Exacerbating blister rust’s spread, wildfire suppression, and pine beetle outbreaks is an ever more pervasive threat: “The fourth big one is climate change and how climate change is interacting with all of these things, ” says Amy Nicholas, endangered species listing coordinator for the agency’s Wyoming field office.\nConservationists have requested federal protection for whitebark pines under the ESA for more than 25 years, beginning in 1991. In 2011, the Fish and Wildlife Service found that the pine was likely to go extinct across much of its U.S. range in as little as 100 years, or less than two generations. Yet instead of listing whitebark pine as endangered, the agency listed the tree as a “candidate” species, essentially waitlisting the species for help.\nThe reason came down to a funding shortage: listing whitebark pine as endangered would have required the agency to devote resources to saving it. Without enough money to care for all disappearing species, the agency focuses on listing species that are part of legal settlements, for example.\nAs a candidate species, whitebark pine got a listing priority number, based on how likely it is to go extinct. In 2011, whitebark pine received one of the highest priority rankings, yet other species were being federally protected and whitebark pine was not.\nTwo Montana-based conservation organizations – WildWest Institute and Alliance for the Wild Rockies – sued the agency, arguing that by prioritizing candidate species ranked lower than whitebark pine, the Fish and Wildlife Service wasn’t following its own guidelines for deciding which species to protect. The conservation groups felt species should be given help in order of biological need.\nThe court ruled in favor of the agency. While pointing out that current policies on listing seemed inadequate when “dealing with the potential life or death of an entire species,” the court concluded that the agency was not required to make decisions based on its candidate species ranking system. “Scarce funds and limited staff resources may prevent FWS from taking immediate final action to list or delist a species,” the presiding judge wrote.\nAccording to Patrick Parenteau, a Vermont Law School professor, the agency often makes listing decisions based on finances. “This is a systematic problem that the Fish and Wildlife Service has had for decades,” Parenteau says. He points to persistent resistance from Congress and some Republican administrations to fully fund the service’s endangered species listing program.\nFinancial considerations do not factor into whether a species gets listed, but rather in what order and when, agency biologist Craig Hansen says. “The listing budget is given to us by Congress and has an annual cap,” Hansen says. “We can’t pull funds from other programs to list.” The service’s funding woes have led to a backlog of organisms waiting to be listed, such as northern California’s Sierra Nevada red fox, which in 2016 included just 29 remaining adults.\nIn 2016, to stop the constant backlog of candidate species waiting to be listed as threatened or endangered, the Obama administration drafted a streamlined process that prioritized the most imperiled species backed by the best available science. It wasn’t adopted by the Trump administration.\nMatthew Koehler, executive director of plaintiff WildWest Institute, grows frustrated talking about the whitebark case. Koehler believes the funding shortage that stalled the whitebark’s listing is part of a strategy by Congressional members in both parties to tie the service’s hands. “Then, the same members of Congress complain that the ESA doesn’t work or that it moves too slow,” he says.\nIndeed, this past February, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., led a Senate hearing to “modernize the Endangered Species Act,” arguing in a statement that the ESA has not been successful enough and causes economic harm.\nFunding is only one of the ESA’s difficulties, though. Court battles also stymie species’ recoveries. For each species, a listing decision takes years, followed by litigation from whoever opposes the outcome. “It isn’t just a bunch of scientists sitting around a table saying ‘let’s list this species,” says Parenteau. And still, species such as the whitebark disappear.\nAnd then there’s climate change. Congress wrote the ESA in the 1970s, long before scientists understood the profound ways in which greenhouse gases affect species and their homes. The ESA is designed to address discrete problems: overgrazing, point-source pollution, exurban development. In its revision of ESA listing guidelines, the Obama administration acknowledged as much: the agency could have put off working on species endangered by climate change, including whitebark pine, since it has less power to help them.\nWith our existing environmental laws, whitebarks may yet survive in the northernmost parts of their range in Canada, Parenteau says. “But in the southern part of its range, unless we get serious about climate mitigation, it’s probably doomed anyway,” he says.\nIn any case, listing isn’t necessary for the feds to take action: Almost all whitebarks occur on federal public land, where the government can take steps to protect the species without listing, Parenteau says.\nIndeed, having given up on the ESA for now, the WildWest Institute is seeking other pathways to whitebark protection. The organization is supporting a bill introduced to Congress to designate public lands in the northern Rockies where whitebarks live as wilderness. “We see wilderness designation as a way to protect that entire ecosystem,” Koehler says.\nWhen pressed to make predictions for the longterm, Keane says areas where whitebarks used to flourish will probably eventually burn. By then, though, there will be no source trees left for birds to find seeds to spread to freshly burned areas. Instead, he imagines, shrub herblands will grow.\nStill, unlike Parenteau, Keane is optimistic about the climate extremes that whitebarks can survive, if the trees get help. He’s part of a new collaboration between the U.S. Forest Service and two NGOs – American Forests and the Whitebark Pine Ecosystem Foundation – that’s working to restore whitebarks in the West. The group’s even developing rust-resistant seedlings. “Whitebark pine doesn’t even start optimum cone production until it’s 200 years old,” he says. “What we want to make sure is what we’re doing now, 100 years from now we will see the fruits of our labors.”\n“If we do nothing,” Keane says, “we are making sure that it will be so low on the landscape, we will probably name the ones we see, there will be so few of them.”\nMaya L.

The coming crisis is more insidious, structural, and almost certain to blow up eventually.\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) predicts that by 2050 the world will face a $400 trillion shortfall (pdf) in retirement savings. (Yes, that’s trillion, with a “T”.) The WEF defines a shortfall as anything less than what’s required to provide 70% of a person’s pre-retirement income via public pensions and private savings.\nThe US will find itself in the biggest hole, falling $137 trillion short of what’s necessary to fund adequate retirements in 2050. It is followed by China’s $119 trillion shortfall.\nProjected retirement savings shortfalls\nUSChinaIndiaUKJapanCanadaAustraliaNetherlands$137 trillion11985332613962050USChinaIndiaUKJapanCanadaAustraliaNetherlands$137 trillion1198533261396\nData: World Economic Forum\nAsset returns have been lower than they were in the past and people are living longer, so some of this shortfall is to be expected. The WEF assumes many people born recently will live beyond 100, which may be a bit much (the Social Security Administration expects most Americans born today to live into their mid-80s). But much of the massive shortfall is baked into retirement systems; setups in which nobody, neither individuals nor the government, saves enough. About three-quarters of the projected comes from underfunded promises from governments, with the rest mostly accounted for by under-saving on the part of individuals.\nMichael Drexler, head of financial and infrastructure systems at the WEF, who edited of the report, likens the problem to climate change. “Like climate change, you don’t see the consequences today, but if you do nothing the problem builds up and then there is nothing you can do,” he says. “Today you can still change things, but if you do nothing you’ll wind up with a problem that is three to four times the global economy.”\nForecasting anything accurately in 2050 is tricky. We could get lucky, in a sense, and people might start dying younger. More happily, asset returns might pick up. Some argue that worries are unfounded, because we can still pay pensions today and sort out any future problems if they become acute. Others cite uncertainty around the estimates as reason to delay action today. But uncertainty goes both ways—things could be better or worse, and the worst-case scenario poses much bigger costs than we can bear.\nActing sooner ensures lower costs in the future. Putting money aside for retirement now confers the benefit of compound interest and provides certainty to financial markets that fear ballooning government debts. For example the US Social Security Administration estimates that its shortfall could be fixed with an immediate 2.58-percentage-point tax increase, or a 16% cut in benefits. If the government waits until 2034 (the year it can no longer pay full benefits given its current trajectory) it would need a 3.58-percentage-point tax increase, or a 21% benefit cut. If the shortfall proves bigger than expected, the costs of waiting will be larger, too.\nThe report offers several suggestions to address the shortfall. Most include ways to boost individual saving by offering retirement accounts to a wider population and expanding financial literacy. The authors advocate diversifying investments beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Drexler says that investing in a diversified portfolio of infrastructure projects can increase returns and enhance economic growth.\nFinancing a long and comfortable retirement requires contributions from multiple sources, as well as shared risk. “If in 2050 people reach 85 and run out of money they’ll need to rely on Social Security,” Drexler explains. “But if there’s a shortfall the government will be overwhelmed by demand or pensioners living in poverty. We must start educating people now, so we have a good [defined-contribution pension] plans so people have something.”\nStill, an overwhelming majority of the short-fall comes from government programs. In order to address this problem, governments must adequately and proactively fund their entitlements too, either by increasing taxes or by cutting benefits. Individuals alone cannot save enough to compensate for the unrealistic promises their governments have made."},{"url":"https://thedevelopmentset.com/trump-heres-why-you-shouldn-t-stop-funding-family-planning-e95d0a936143","title":"Trump, Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Stop Funding Family Planning","author_text":"Alex Silberman","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Development Set","description":"The Trump Administration’s recent decision to deny future United States funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) will unequivocally make the world a worse place.

UNFPA is not perfect, but it is an important program that delivers life-saving services to improve health in the world’s most vulnerable places. For instance, it supports reproductive healthcare in over 150 countries, leads programs to fight gender-based violence, and funds critical HIV/AIDS prevention initiatives.\nAnytime is a bad moment to reduce global health resources, but cutting aid now feels particularly unwise.\nFamine-like conditions in East Africa and Yemen have put millions in desperate need of assistance. Over 65 million people have fled their homes globally, including over 21 million refugees. 830 women died every day in 2015 due to complications related to pregnancy and child birth — the vast majority in low-income countries.\nIn 2015, the U.S. contributed nearly $31 million to UNFPA’s core budget and over $75 million total, making it one of the largest donors supporting maternal health and children in the world. In fact, the current U.S. contributions would support UNFPA’s requested humanitarian action in Syria, Iraq, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, combined.\nWithout American funding, there will be a dramatic increase in easily-preventable maternal deaths, unsafe abortions, and child suffering, especially in the world’s most volatile places.

Predictive analytics use schools’ and programs’ existing data to help them identify risk earlier and more accurately.","date":"2017-04-26","full_text":"THE PROBLEM: HOW TO ASSESS YOUNG PEOPLE’S RISK USING MORE DATA BUT LESS TIME\nMany low-income young people are not reaching important milestones for success (for example, completing a program or graduating from school on time). But the social-service organizations and schools that serve them often struggle to identify who is at more or less risk. These institutions often either over- or underestimate risk, missing opportunities to intervene with those who need more help or inefficiently providing services to those who do not need them. Most “early warning systems” of risk rely on only a few measures, mainly because in the course of day-to-day practice, one can keep track of only so much information at a time. Yet this approach ignores a wealth of data collected for different purposes that could help programs and schools identify risk earlier and more accurately.\nA school administrator sees students struggling to pass the ninth-grade algebra exam and wants to know each student’s risk of failing. She has access to students’ past course histories and math assignments. She also thinks more factors may be at work, but reviewing more data feels overwhelming.\nMDRC uses cutting-edge methods and a field-tested framework to capitalize on that wealth of data. With predictive analytics, we can:\nRank young people by their risk levels\nShow variation in young people’s risks and needs at a single point in time\nCapture changes in risk as new information is collected\nTo get a better sense of who is at risk of failing algebra, the administrator wants to take advantage of past course history and performance on math assignments, as well as factors such as whether a student is an English language learner, whether that student has moved frequently, and the student’s attendance patterns. Since she does not have time or know how to combine and analyze those data, she needs an approach that can help while producing an easy-to-interpret result.\nMDRC can apply predictive analytics to identify risk levels for individual young people but also aggregate risk levels for sites (schools or program locations), so that institutions can better direct their resources.\nPredictive analytics can answer questions such as:\nAbsence: What is the likelihood that an individual will miss school or program participation more than 10 percent of the year?\nCourse failure: Which students are most likely to fail a required exam in a given subject?\nCompletion: Is a young person more at risk of not completing Program A or Program B?\nVariation in risk: How is the risk of not graduating on time spread among schools or centers in a district?\nChange in risk: How do young people’s risks of not completing a program change during the course of a year?\nThe administrator wants to see whether students who are not at risk of failing at the beginning of the ninth grade become at risk of failing six weeks into the school year. This analysis can help her understand who might need additional services and when.\nMDRC works with an organization to assess whether predictive analytics are appropriate and valuable for its goals and questions.\nAlready assess or guess at young people’s risk of not reaching certain milestones, and want to improve the accuracy of your risk assessments.\nCan implement interventions meant to help young people at risk.\nMake the most of limited resources by directing services only to those at risk.\nBelieve that targeting services based on risk will increase the success of an intervention.\nIf so, we investigate how ready the organization is for predictive analytics.\nMake data readily available that are updated throughout the year.\nAre ready to communicate and act on results.\nEmploy a staff and a data system that can sustain predictive work.\nMDRC works with the organization to identify which milestones we should focus on. We choose ones where there are enough good data to work with and where the risk involved is relevant to the organization’s decisions about interventions.\nFor each milestone we choose with the organization, we calculate a likelihood that each individual will not reach that milestone.\nWe help the organization incorporate these results into its tracking systems. We help it prepare to sustain predictive analytics and incorporate the approach into its continuous improvement processes.\nWe also help organizations understand the limitations of predictive analytics. Predictive analytics can only assess risk — they do not reveal anything about the effectiveness of an intervention. But MDRC can use other rigorous methods, such as randomized field trials, to answer those questions. Our experience from evaluating dozens of youth programs as well as designing interventions informed by behavioral science can help organizations decide what to do next: how best to intervene and with whom.\nFull"},{"url":"http://www.takepart.com/article/2016/12/14/homemade-holiday-gifts","title":"How to Make DIY Food Gifts for the Holidays","author_text":null,"keywords":["Food"],"publication_text":"TakePart","description":"From herb-flecked butter to versatile spice blends, you can whip up great presents in the kitchen.","date":"","full_text":"Next week is the winter solstice, and take heart: We are closer to spring than we were in September. That said, we all still have the holidays to think about—this year brings a lively mash-up of Christmas and Hanukkah—as well as everyday meals.\nAlthough it’s great fun to write about seasonal treats such as holiday cookies, craft cocktails, potato latkes, or festive sides—it’s the latter challenge that interests me the most. Let’s face it: Trying to shop sustainably and then translating what you buy into nourishing meals on a regular basis isn’t the easiest job, especially now, when time and energy are in short supply. Last December, I wrote about a number of strategies and ideas that get me through the holidays and beyond, and this week, in what is my last column for TakePart (RIP), I feel compelled to circle back.\nThese are tough times, after all, for folks who love to eat and cook in a mindful way. Granted, it has never been simpler to find certified-organic produce or humanely raised meat, for example, or to feed vegetarians and vegans, Paleos, or raw foodists. But dealing with our present food system involves any number of difficult choices, leaving us stressed, depressed, hypervigilant, and just plain exhausted—and even more in need of the sustenance and connection that we find when we gather around a table together and eat something delicious.\nParticularly in cold weather, when most of us don’t have access to a great range of local vegetables and fruits, I find myself relying on homemade condiments to provide interest and intrigue in all sorts of dishes. Not only do you have control over the ingredients used (no nasty preservatives or high-fructose corn syrup, for instance), but you can minimize packaging waste while maximizing freshness. And did I mention that they make great last-minute presents? Just saying.\nWith the New Year rapidly approaching, this is also an excellent time for a kitchen reset. Reorganizing or updating your pantry is a biggish project but one that will pay dividends throughout 2017. At the very least, having a stockpile of power condiments—the ultimate quick fixes—in your culinary repertoire allows you to add complexity and brightness to any number of weekday meals. You will find four of my favorites below, and I can’t begin to tell you how hard it was to choose.\nHappy Hols! Happy New Year! Here’s hoping you’ve found Jane Says enlightening, entertaining, and yes, infuriating at times. Promise me you’ll never be afraid to step back from what you know—or think you know—about food. I sure as hell won’t. Now, let’s all go cook something sustainable and sustaining for the people we love.\nDukkah\nThe roasty-toasty Egyptian seed-and-spice mixture called dukkah (pronounced “dook-ah” and derived from the Arabic word meaning “to pound”) is typically eaten on bread dipped in olive oil and served at breakfast or as a starter—but why stop there? In My Paris Kitchen, David Lebovitz writes that dukkah is a great base for the world’s fastest-to-make dip, and it’s true. Mix it with good olive oil—I like to use a mild, fruity French one, such as Alziari—and serve with slices of seeded baguette, fresh pitas, or crudités. Dukkah is also delicious on roasted cauliflower à la Lebovitz or sprinkled on a fried egg sandwich or avocado toast. There are many different versions of dukkah, but my go-to recipe is from Lebovitz’s book. That’s not as much of a disconnect as it may seem; thanks to the Romans and Arabs, spices were used very early on in France.\nShopping and prep notes: Buy the hazelnuts, sesame seeds, and pumpkin seeds from a place with a high turnover and taste before using. If they’re rancid, take them back. Toast each spice separately so some don’t burn (they’ll be bitter), and let the mixture cool before grinding; otherwise, you may end up with a paste instead of a dry, loose, crumbly blend.\nCompound Butters\nA compound butter is simply butter creamed with a flavoring or two—minced shallot and thyme, say. A classic French accompaniment for topping everything from steak to steamed vegetables, it is basically an instant sauce—and an easy way to add finesse to the scratchiest of scratch suppers. What’s called maître d’hotel butter is reason alone for a (grass-fed) steak: With a fork, mash together a stick of softened unsalted butter with a quarter teaspoon finely grated lemon zest, a tablespoon of lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley, and half a teaspoon of coarse salt until combined well. Put the butter on a sheet of wax paper or parchment paper and form into a log, then refrigerate for at least an hour to let the flavors develop. In an anchovy butter, a dollop of anchovy paste adds depth and that certain something called umami without tasting the least bit fishy; it’s delicious on a steak or burger, lamb, or chicken. A mustard-lemon butter is especially good on chicken and fish and makes “eating the rainbow” more delicious than ever.\nPrep note: A compound butter keeps in the fridge for a couple days. Wrapped well in wax paper and foil, then frozen, it will keep at least a month; just lop off slices as needed, and voilà! Dinner is served.\nQuick Mexican Pickled Onions\nThis quick pickle from Zanne Stewart, former head of the food department at Gourmet magazine, was a staff favorite, as it adds a piquant crunch to everything from a turkey sandwich to tacos, burritos, or veggie burgers. Rosy-pink in color, the onions are as pretty as they are versatile, and a jar of them is a near permanent fixture in my fridge. Here’s how you make them: Bring 2 cups water, 2 tablespoons red-wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 1 teaspoon coarse salt to a boil in a 1-quart heavy saucepan. Stir in a medium red onion that’s been halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise. Simmer, uncovered, until the onions are crisp-tender, which takes all of about 3 minutes. Drain and cool to room temperature before refrigerating.\nHarissa\nThis blend of hot chiles, garlic, olive oil, and spices is a traditional condiment and flavor base in Tunisia and other parts of North Africa. Like dukkah (above), various versions abound. You can find commercial brands at specialty shops and online, but nothing beats the profound, elemental taste of homemade. My latest go-to rendition is from Jerusalem: A Cookbook, by Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi, and its heat is deep, rich, and perfectly balanced. Use it every which way—alongside grilled meats or fish, slicked onto a roasted chicken or vegetables, or stirred into stews, soups, couscous. I could eat it on cornflakes."},{"url":"http://www.newsminer.com/opinion/community_perspectives/congress-wise-to-reject-fake-privacy-rule/article_7af28410-4822-11e7-8201-878c6cadd3e2.html","title":"Congress wise to reject fake privacy rule","author_text":"David Boyle and Drew Johnson","keywords":["Geography Of Alaska","Medical Privacy","Fairbanks","Alaska","Alaska","Federal Communications Commission","High Speed Internet","Congress","Daily News Miner","Dan Sullivan","Google","Ajit Pai","Fairbanks Daily News Miner","Facebook","David Boyle","Ted Stevens","Internet Browsing History","Lisa Murkowski","Taxpayers Protection Alliance","Federal Trade Commission","Executive Director Of The Alaska Policy Forum","Washington","D.C.","Internet Service Providers","Drew Johnson","Chairman","Don Young","Senate Appropriations Committee","Senate Commerce Committee","Online Privacy"],"publication_text":"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner","description":"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner community perspective:","date":"","full_text":"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner community perspective:\nThose of us who live in Alaska understand there are real challenges to life in the 49th state. We all know a lot of the bureaucrats and politicians in Washington, D.C., don’t know what that means; they never have. The internet is making those challenges easier to face, but some people in government are fighting steps to make the net fair and open for everyone.\nLast week, the Federal Communications Commission moved forward on an agenda to promote fairness among all businesses that provide services on the internet. The move will help Alaska move into the 21st century and take advantage of the many educational and business opportunities that high speed internet makes possible.\nThe goal of the policy decision by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is to return how the internet is regulated to the way it was when our own Sen. Ted Stevens was serving as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee. We all know that system was designed to be good for Alaska and those of us living here.\nBut sadly, some progressive special interests are attempting to convince us that these changes at the FCC will be bad for us Alaskans. They claim the FCC rules and a recent vote by Congress to overturn unfair regulations means our internet browsing history is now for sale by internet service providers.\nNothing could be further from the truth. Our browser history isn’t for sale and it never has been.\nFor more than two decades, another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, has protected Americans’ online privacy. Last fall, just a week before Election Day, the FCC pushed through a second set of privacy rules upending the long-standing FTC rules. The FCC’s rules applied harsh new obligations and reporting requirements on ISPs while doing nothing to protect our privacy from the tech companies that actually collect, store and sell your personal data for profit — including Google, Facebook and many others.\nIn the end, the FCC privacy rules didn’t protect privacy. All they did was set the entire system up for massive confusion by creating different sets of rules for different companies. So, before the rules could take effect later this year, Congress rightfully rejected them.\nThe vote by Congress to overturn the FCC’s absurd regulations means we continue under the privacy rules that have been in place for more than 20 years. The laws Congress put in place and the rules overseen by the FTC have given inventors the freedom to create new products and services while making us safer from scammers and criminals.\nThat’s why so many people were upset when the FCC decided to wreck a perfectly good system.\nAlaskans should applaud Congressman Don Young and Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan for helping to overturn the FCC’s unnecessary regulation. Because of their vote, the FTC and the FCC have pledged to work together to harmonize privacy rules so they apply to every company equally. The chairmen of the two agencies have promised to create a “comprehensive and consistent framework.”\nWe Alaskans understand that fair competition with everyone following the same rules means the best result. The clarity of a single set of rules will help to protect our privacy and spur innovations that make life in Alaska a little easier.\nDavid Boyle is executive director of the Alaska Policy Forum.

Magazine","description":"","date":"","full_text":"I’ve rarely been so moved by a political speech. If you haven’t heard it, don’t miss it.\nI refer to the speech on May 19 by Mitch Landrieu, mayor of New Orleans. He was speaking about the reasons for his city’s removal of monuments to Confederate generals. (You can read the text, but to get the full emotional impact I recommend watching the video.) You will understand why New York Times columnist Frank Bruni called the speech a masterpiece and noted that Landrieu has been mentioned in a list of potential 2020 presidential candidates.\nAs Bruni observes, what makes this speech truly extraordinary in this time of vicious partisanship is that Landrieu makes his point “without vilifying anyone” or mentioning any political party. The speech acknowledges our nation’s dark sins—most dramatically in the brutality of the institution of slavery—with unflinching honesty. At the same time, it communicates a positive vision of a future that we Americans, founded in diversity, are uniquely positioned to create.\nLandrieu briefly, but eloquently, summarizes our country’s history of diversity. The lands now identified as the United States were originally populated by diverse tribes, a few of which he names. For most of us it is sufficiently well known that he had no need to mention that they were subsequently dominated, disrupted, and displaced by immigrant peoples of varied races, religions, and cultural ethnicities. Many of these immigrants were themselves driven from their original homes by deprivation, injustice, and brutality. Many continued to experience deprivation, injustice, and brutality in their new homeland, though far from the magnitude of that suffered by the slaves.\nAs I have demonstrated in much of my own writing, this pattern of suppression and exploitation has been characteristic of most of the dominant human societies of the past 5,000 years. It continues today under the economic system we know as capitalism and is the source of the deep resentment that led to the election victory of a man Landrieu felt no need to mention.\nNew Orleans has historically had a widely diverse population. It has experienced tense divisions based on that diversity. Yet, Landrieu notes, this diversity has also served as a tremendous source of creativity and cultural richness. It has at times also brought community and unity. That is the vision that so captured my imagination from Landrieu’s presentation.\nLandrieu’s speech is open to a variety of interpretations. The common element is that it is evoking an extraordinary public response for a speech by a city mayor—and most of that response is positive. I believe the reaction reflects a deep hunger in this country for honesty about our collective past and for a vision of the rich, creative potential of a society of exceptional racial, ethnic, and religious diversity.\nFew among our American ancestors endured hardship and injustice as great as that borne by America’s original people or the slaves brought to this continent in chains, but many endured hardship and injustice, as do many of today’s working class, that no human should at this point in our human history need, or be expected, to endure.\nPerhaps by openly recognizing the hardship and injustice that so many—both past and present—endured, we can learn to celebrate the creative possibilities of our diversity even as we recognize the beauty of our common humanity.\nAs a now global and intensely interdependent species, we humans have a desperate need to transcend the differences that historically have divided us so we may join in common cause to create a world of peace, justice, and environmental health that works for all that it is now within our means to create.\nTo move beyond the brutality that many of our ancestors bore, and that many among us—though in lesser measure—still endure, we must acknowledge it and recognize, as Landrieu does, the profound wisdom of our national motto: e pluribus unum—out of many we are one."},{"url":"http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Stolen-GPS-devices-lead-police-to-suspects-in-11193003.php","title":"Stolen GPS devices lead police to suspects in Santa Clara burglary","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"SFGate","description":"The apparatuses and other computer equipment worth $18,000 were stolen from a business in the 3100 block of De La Cruz Boulevard in Santa Clara that had its door pried open Tuesday, police said.

The victims included two police officers wounded while sitting in a van. And 10 others were shot Sunday during an impromptu memorial service for a man who had been killed a few hours earlier near the same spot along a neighborhood street.\nThe use of high-powered weaponry is an unsettling subplot in Chicago’s long-running struggle with gun and gang violence. Most of the city’s shootings involve handguns, but the use of an AK-47 or AR-15 rifle can wound far more victims in far less time, leaving police overwhelmed and residents ever more wary of venturing outdoors.\n“People are walking around traumatized,” said Alderman Raymond Lopez, who lives a few blocks from the scene of Sunday’s shooting in the Brighton Park neighborhood. “It’s like they have that glazed look, like they’re not sure what to expect, not certain of what’s going to come out from behind the shadows at any given moment.”\nResidents of Brighton Park, a working-class Latino neighborhood with well-kept homes and bustling restaurants, said occasional gunfire has long been part of life, but only in recent months do they recall such use of high-powered rifles. The latest shootings, which left three people dead, came at a time of escalating violence and turf disputes between Hispanic gangs in this part of Chicago, according to police. An analysis this year by The Chicago Tribune found 33 instances in a nine-month period where semi-automatic rifles were used in Brighton Park and nearby Back of the Yards, far more than anywhere else in the city.\nIn December, outraged neighbors held a vigil after four people were shot with an assault-style rifle near an elementary school. “Now this happens, six months later, and we ask the parents: ‘OK. What do you all want to do?’ ” Marcos Ceniceros, an organizer with the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, said. “And it’s like, ‘No, what can we do?’ There’s a lot of frustration.”\nChicago police said there has been no spike in assault rifle shootings citywide this year. Police have seized 79 assault rifles in 2017, only a slight increase from last year. Across Chicago, 194 people have been killed this year, about 6 percent fewer than during the same period in 2016, when violence spiked to levels not seen since the 1990s.\nPolice said Hispanic gangs, suspected in this month’s bloodshed, are the most frequent users of assault rifles. One of the men charged in the shooting of the two officers had been out on bond after being charged with another gun crime — evidence, police said, of a judiciary that is too lax.\n“We know the gangs that have the weapons,” said Anthony Guglielmi, a Chicago police spokesman. “We know the gangs that are using the weapons. And in some form, we kind of know where the weapons are coming from.”\nAmerican street gangs have used assault-style rifles for years. One such gun was used to shoot 13 people at a Chicago park in 2013, and the authorities have seized them from gangs in states including California and Missouri. Last year, hundreds of guns, including high-powered rifles, were stolen from a freight train passing through Chicago’s South Side. The weapons are more expensive, harder to come by and harder to conceal than revolvers and pistols, but present nonetheless.\nIn Brighton Park, residents said they viewed the recent rifle shootings as evidence that long-festering gang disputes have metastasized into something even more vicious."},{"url":"http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/06/06/531591202/harvard-rescinds-admission-of-10-students-over-obscene-facebook-messages","title":"Harvard Rescinds Admission Of 10 Students Over Obscene Facebook Messages","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"NPR.org","description":"Several would-be freshmen in the class of 2021 lost their spots when they posted offensive material in a group Facebook chat. College officials and high school counselors are reacting to the news.","date":"","full_text":"This week saw a remarkable collision of free speech, toxic Internet culture and more, unfolding at one of the world's most prestigious universities.\nAt least 10 admitted Harvard students in the Class of 2021 had their admissions offers rescinded after a group exchange of racist and sexually offensive Facebook messages, the Harvard Crimson student newspaper reported this week.\nNPR Ed tries to focus on the types of colleges that the vast majority of American students attend. But this incident, small as it was, took place at the end of a school year that has been marked by clashes and riots pitting free speech against hate speech, both online and on campus.\nElite colleges like Harvard are expanding financial aid but still struggling to assemble classes that represent America's diverse population. And despite the use of \"trigger warnings,\" the line between hateful memes circulated in chatrooms and the voices amplified in campus auditoriums seems thinner than ever.\nMeanwhile, college admissions officers and high school counselors across the country are reminding students that what they say online can hurt themselves and others.\nBut first, let's back up and go over the details. According to our reporting and The Crimson, members of Harvard's incoming class are invited to join an official Facebook group, which is moderated. From there, some students form their own group chats around interests or similarities, such as studying political science or being from New Jersey.\nThe students in question, admitted in early December, formed a group chat known variously as \"General F**kups\" and \"Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens.\" At one time, it had as many as 100 members. They sent one another images with captions that were racist and anti-Semitic and that made light of pedophilia, among other offensive themes.\nHarvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane told us in an email, \"We do not comment publicly on the admissions status of individual applicants.\"\nLike other colleges, Harvard has a policy of revoking admissions offers if an applicant does not graduate high school, has plunging grades in their last semester, is found to have lied on their application or engages in other morally questionable behavior. This can include online speech.\nHowever, university officials and high school counselors we spoke with told us these policies are rarely invoked.\n\"Most students attend community colleges and public universities that don't care what memes their admitted students post online,\" says Jeremy Goldman of the Maryland School Counselor Association. Nevertheless, he says, \"we reinforce messages to students to be positive digital citizens in all contexts. Inappropriate, offensive and threatening posts have a much greater impact on students' and their peers' emotional and social well-being than ... on college admissions.\"\nStephanie Beechem, a spokeswoman for the University of California system — the nation's largest — said in an email that officials there do not \"actively monitor social media accounts. Social media presence plays no role in our admissions process. As we stated, only if an incident is reported to us that purportedly violates our Principles of Community and/or Student Code of Conduct, will it be investigated in the proper channels.\"\nNancy Beane is the president of the National Association for College Admissions Counseling and a college counselor for 25 years. She says, \"colleges can rescind offers for all kinds of reasons,\" but \"from our perspective, it doesn't happen very often.\" Nevertheless, she says she often reminds students: \"You have to be responsible for what you say,\" and if students make mistakes, they should own up to them.\nAccording to The Crimson, some of last year's admitted Harvard freshmen engaged in similar behavior using a program called GroupMe, which sends group text messages. That time, they were criticized by university administrators but not individually punished.\nBut in the past year, the question of what type of speech is permissible has repeatedly arisen on campuses nationwide. Protests, even riots, roiled University of California, Berkeley, Middlebury College in Vermont, and Alabama's Auburn University over appearances by right-wing provocateurs Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos, The Bell Curve author Charles Murray and white nationalist Richard Spencer. Some states are introducing legislation to protect free speech on campus.\nMeanwhile, 43 percent of young people have been called offensive names on the Internet, according to a national study released earlier this year by the nonpartisan think tank Data \u0026 Society. And an overwhelming majority, 84 percent, say they have witnessed it happening to someone else.\n\"We're around memes all the time,\" says Wyatt Hurt, an incoming Harvard freshman from Grand Junction, Colo., who was not involved in the meme exchange.\nHe says fellow students he has spoken to online overwhelmingly agree that these students should be barred from admission. \"You have your First Amendment rights. But when you apply, you sign an honor code to be good and virtuous. Why would we want to have those people in our class?\" he asks.\nFor Monica Bulger, a researcher with Data \u0026 Society, the incident is a reminder that \"ignorance isn't a matter of stupidity.\"\nShe says that researchers like herself are increasingly taking an interest in \"transgressive behavior\" among youth: for example, studying the motivations of cyberbullies as well as the experiences of the victims.\nWhile a lack of mature decision-making skills has always been a hallmark of late adolescence, Bulger says, the online arena allows speech to persist, endure and travel further.\nIt also creates a sense of distance: \"When I'm talking to people counseling students at the college level,\" she explains, \"they're saying that the students have a lack of awareness of the consequences of harmful messages. The students say, 'It's not real. It goes away.' \""},{"url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/05/is-depression-contributing-to-the-opioid-epidemic/526560","title":"How Untreated Depression Contributes to the Opioid Epidemic","author_text":"Olga Khazan","keywords":["The Atlantic","The Atlantic Magazine","The Atlantic.Com","Atlantic","News","Opinion","Breaking News","Analysis","Commentary","Business","Politics","Culture","International","Science","Technology","National And Life"],"publication_text":"The Atlantic","description":"Research suggests some are seeking out painkillers when what they really need is Prozac.","date":"","full_text":"It can sometimes seem strange how so much of the country got hooked on opioids within just a few years. Deaths from prescription drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone have more than quadrupled since 1999, according to the CDC. But pain doesn’t seem to be the only culprit: About one-third of Americans have chronic pain, but not all of them take prescription painkillers for it. Of those who do take prescription opioids, not all become addicted.\nSeveral researchers now believe depression, one of the most common medical diagnoses in the U.S., might be one underlying cause that’s driving some patients to seek out prescription opioids and to use them improperly.\nPeople with depression show abnormalities in the body’s release of its own, endogenous, opioid chemicals. Depression tends to exacerbate pain—it makes chronic pain last longer and hurts the recovery process after surgery.\n“Depressed people are in a state of alarm,” said Mark Sullivan, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington. “They’re fearful, or frozen in place. There’s a heightened sense of threat.” That increased threat sensitivity might also be what heightens sensations of pain.\nNot only do people with depression tend to be more pain-sensitive, the effect of opioids can, for some, feel as mood-elevating as an antidepressant.\n“Depression is a mixed bag,” Sullivan said. “People can feel sluggish and uninterested, but they can also feel agitated, irritated, and anxious. They feel both unrelaxed and really unmotivated at the same time.”\nOpioids might, at least temporarily, feel soothing and sedating. Indeed, several studies have found that buprenorphine, an opioid that is typically used to wean people off of heroin, has some antidepressant properties.\nSullivan and other researchers from Washington and California found in 2012 that depressed people were about twice as likely as non-depressed ones to misuse their painkillers for non-pain symptoms, and depressed individuals were between two and three times more likely to ramp up their own doses of painkillers. Adolescents with depression were also more likely, in one study, to use prescription painkillers for non-medical reasons and to become addicted.\nIn 2015, a different group of researchers found that depressed people were likely to keep using opioids, even when their pain had subsided and when they were more functional. “If the emotional pain, the depression, is never properly diagnosed or treated, the patient might continue taking the opioid because it’s treating something,” said Jenna Goesling, an assistant professor in the department of anesthesiology at the University of Michigan and an author of that study.\nMost recently, a group of Harvard researchers found that mood disorders didn’t increase the likelihood that people would start using opioids, but they nearly doubled the risk that a person already using opioids would continue to use in the long-term.\nFinally, prescription opioids can also exacerbate depression, creating a vicious cycle for patients who become dependent on them.\nMost opioid abuse starts with people taking medications that weren’t prescribed for them, so some depressed people are simply pilfering a relative or friend’s extra pills. But some unnecessary painkiller prescriptions might start when some patients, fearing stigma, raise their pain symptoms with their doctors, rather than their depression, Sullivan said. “People are treated like innocent victims when they present with pain complaints,” Sullivan said. But depression, wrongly, “feels like more of a personal failing than being in pain.” After all, it’s easier to explain not being able to get out of bed because of a bad back than crushing sadness.\nDepression is widely under-diagnosed and untreated, and the shortage of mental-health providers is especially acute in rural areas where the opioid epidemic has hit hardest. Goesling said that we could get closer to untangling the messy connection between pain and depression by improving access to mental health care for people who have chronic pain.\nThe Republicans’ new health-care plan, which recently passed the House, however, doesn’t do that. Not only does it make major cuts to Medicaid, which in some states pays for half of all addiction treatment cases, it also would allow states to stop forcing insurers to cover mental-health treatment.\nIf it is driven—at least in part—by depression, opioid abuse can be seen as a cry for help. “People have distress—their life is not working, they’re not sleeping, they’re not functioning,” Sullivan said, “and they want something to make all that better.”\nBut for depressed patients, heavy-duty painkillers aren’t the right “something.”"},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-05-16/fewer-migrants-are-crossing-mediterranean-similar-numbers-are-dying","title":"Fewer migrants are crossing the Mediterranean than last year.

But 2017 is on course to be just as high.\nAn estimated 1,344 people have been reported dead or missing at sea so far this year, while about 53,000 made it across, according to the United Nations.\nThe total number of migrant crossings is down dramatically compared to the same period in 2016, when close to 200,000 made the full journey. But the death count is virtually the same.\nWhat’s making these sea journeys more dangerous?\nOne reason is that more people are taking the longer, riskier central Mediterranean route, from the coast of war-torn Libya to Italy. There was a 33 percent increase in people taking this route from January through April, compared to the same period last year.\nThe much safer and shorter sea crossing from Turkey to Greece has been largely closed off since a controversial deal between the European Union and Turkey in March 2016.\nNot only that, traffickers in Libya are filling flimsy boats with a greater number of people to make more money — an average of 100 to 150 people per vessel. The boats cannot take the strain of all those passengers and many fall apart or capsize.\nLibya is the main transit point for people traveling from across North Africa to reach Europe. Reports of abuse, torture and sexual violence against migrants are commonplace in the country, carried out by smugglers and authorities alike.\nAll of this amounts to a perilous journey from start to end for desperate people fleeing instability, poverty and war.\nThere simply aren’t enough rescue missions operating in the Mediterranean.\nSince the EU cut back its rescue operation in 2014 to focus on deterring migrants from trying to reach Europe, NGOs and volunteer groups have stepped in to fill the gap. But they face an overwhelming task.\nThe international charity Save the Children says it has rescued more than 3,500 people this year from the Mediterranean Sea. Five-hundred of them were unaccompanied children.\nIts ship — the Vos Hestia — is equipped to carry around 300 people on its deck. A little over a week ago, it made its biggest rescue of the year, taking more than 500 people on board.\n“Until the EU provides safe and legal routes to Europe, both for those in need of international protection and for other migrants, people — including children and families — will continue to risk their lives to reach Europe,” says Gillian Moyes, Save the Children’s search and rescue team leader aboard the Vos Hestia.\n“The root causes are complex and many but our response is simple: We must stop children drowning. The Mediterranean Sea cannot continue to be a mass unmarked grave for children.”\nCommenting on the recent drownings, earlier this month United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi called for a “redoubling of efforts to solve conflicts, especially in Africa; and using development resources much more strategically to reduce poverty, to mitigate the effects of climate change, and to support countries hosting large numbers of refugees, as well as transit countries.”\n“This is a matter of life or death, which appeals to our most basic sense of humanity and should not be called into question,” he added.\nRichard Hall reported this story in the Mediterranean from aboard the Vos Hestia, a boat chartered by Save the Children for their search and rescue operations at sea.

I thoughtfully reasoned that our system was structured in such a way to check the ambitions of a demagogue like Trump and that the checks and balances on the Presidency would prove too powerful for Trump to do real damage; “Congress would never get on board with this,” “Even the Republican state houses would reject that,” or “Paul Ryan couldn’t possibly allow this,” I would confidently tell myself over and over again as Trump signed one absurd executive order after the other.\nWell, it turns out, I, like many other optimistic analysts, was dead wrong. The Republican Party has almost unanimously embraced the unpopular demagogue as the face of their party, prompting the question… Why? Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that Republicans have a secure grip on power for the foreseeable future, and that the party is more concerned about alienating Trump’s base than building a party that will be successful in the future.\nThe implications of this reality are just now starting to become obvious as the Republican-controlled Congress refuses to challenge the White House. Just today, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight Committee announced that he would not be investigating Michael Flynn, whose resignation has stirred up spurs of questions regarding ethics violations; some have even accusing the short-lived National Security Advisor of treason. Further evidence is found in the embrace of blatantly unqualified candidates nominated to Cabinet positions including Betsy DeVos, who was confirmed despite butchering her nomination hearing, and Rick Perry who now heads the department he once proposed abolishing when running for President in 2012. Republicans easily could have demanded that qualified conservatives be nominated to hold these posts, instead they were silent.\nPerhaps even more troubling than the cabinet selections is the party’s embrace of Trump’s controversial executive orders, namely the Trump Travel Ban, ruled unconstitutional in the courts. Paul Ryan publicly supported the ban, despite his condemnation during the 2016 presidential campaign, previously reasoning, “I do not think it is reflective of our principles, not just as a party, but as a country.” Unless Paul Ryan’s principals magically changed overnight (perhaps due to the Bowling Green Massacre), clearly the political ambitions of the Republican Party have drastically changed. They are no longer resisting the bigotry; instead, they are embracing it for short-term political gain.\nThe only reasonable explanation for this flip-flop and surrender of Republican principles is that the Republican Party is secure in its hold on power. The grim political reality is that Democrats are defending 25 of the 33 Senate seats up for reelection in the 2018 midterms. Ten of these seats are in swing states that Trump carried in 2016, opening the door for Republicans to win a filibuster proof majority. On top of that, due to the structural advantages for Republicans brought about with voter ID laws and redistricting, Democrats would need a miracle to take back the House. As a result, the Republicans do not need to cater to public opinion until 2020, which is a lifetime in American politics.\nI wrote in a previous piece during the election cycle that I believed the Republican Party, by nominating and supporting Donald Trump, was no longer a partner in the pursuit of creating a more just society. This has been proven all too real with the party’s embrace of, now President, Trump. The party’s shallow, nationalistic, agenda is not sustainable. Policies like building a wall on the Mexican border will bear little fruit if ever accomplished. Similarly, the repeal of Obamacare, without a sustainable replacement, will hurt people and alienate voters. In the end, I still believe that Donald Trump will never be able to make America great again in the way that he promised his voters.\nOnce the Trump era inevitably closes, the Republican Party could be in ruins for a generation. Young voters, who are the most vocal opponents of Trump, are only going to be more alienated by the Republican Party if they continue supporting his policies. The only chance the Republicans have in the long term is to hold Trump accountable, challenge his unreasonable policy objectives, and reclaim the Republican principles that used to attract broad segments of the population.\nNevertheless, the Republican establishment clearly needs some convincing. The Women’s March and spontaneous protests in airports across the country in response to the travel ban are an inspiring start, but more work is to be done if the Republicans are to be convinced to switch course. The Republicans must either fear losing Congress in 2018 or be forced to think more about what is in the long-term interest of the party. If not, Congress will continue to cater to the Trump base instead of the majority of Americans who did not vote for him.\nAmericans dissatisfied with President Trump must continue demanding accountability from Republican Representatives and Senators by attending town halls, calling district offices, posting on social media, and encouraging others to do the same. New organizational efforts, such as Swing Left, have potential to mobilize the outrage surrounding Trump into tangible electoral results in 2018 and to convince Republicans to change course, but they will only bear fruit if people continue to stay engaged."},{"url":"http://www.startribune.com/one-dead-27-hurt-as-tornado-ravages-western-wisconsin-trailer-park/422738264","title":"Residents of Wisconsin trailer park try to pick up pieces after deadly tornado hits","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Star Tribune","description":"In the shambled remains of a mobile home park near Chetek, dazed residents look for pets as well as seeking shelter after the storm, which packed winds of 120 to 130 mph.","date":"","full_text":"CHETEK, WIS. – As they picked their way Wednesday through a field of debris toward the 20-foot mound of twisted metal and jagged wood that once was their home, the three Rutledge women had only one thing on their minds: a missing dachshund named Colby.\nOne after the other, they shouted the dog’s name, ending with 13-year-old Mary Rutledge’s desperate cry for a pet that never turned up.\nA tornado that tore through the Prairie Lake Estates mobile home park just north of this western Wisconsin town of 2,200 late Tuesday afternoon killed one man, injured 27 others and sent dozens of families fleeing for shelter or from their homes in hopes of escaping injury or worse.\nIn all, 15 of the park’s 58 mobile homes were destroyed and many more were damaged, forcing nearly everyone who lived here to find shelter Wednesday with relatives and friends or at a local hotel before returning to the scene to assess the damage and pick through the debris.\nThe devastation was so complete that Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald said it was “a miracle” that there were not more deaths or serious injury.\n“We thought we were going to be digging for people here for days,” he said. “Our firefighters and deputies were lifting parts of trailers off people.”\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker visited Wednesday to inspect the damage, and later declared a state of emergency for Barron, Jackson and Rusk counties.\nBy Wednesday afternoon, all the park’s residents had been accounted for. With gas and electrical lines secured, police finally allowed residents to return to their homes about 3 p.m. and wander through the blasted landscape in search of precious pieces of their lives.\nFor the Rutledge family it was a day of heartbreak and tears.\nWhile Mary’s mom, Deeann, was away at work, she and her grandparents, Cindy and Doug Rutledge, were in their home when the tornado hit. On Wednesday, not only was the trailer in ruins and their dog missing, but Doug Rutledge lay in a nearby hospital in critical condition. Doctors had performed emergency surgery to relieve pressure on his brain after he was crushed by a refrigerator.\nOther residents, too, wandered amid the mess, searching for pets and possessions and trying to make sense of what had happened less than 24 hours before.\n“You see this stuff on the Weather Channel and you never think it could happen to you,” said Ron Blomberg. “It’s a lot to take in.”\nSlowly, tentatively, Blomberg and others dug through the massive piles of wreckage, picking out stuffed animals, household appliances and family keepsakes. Often they’d stop, arms folded, staring at the mess the twister left behind.\n“I’m in a little bit of shock,” Blomberg said. “One minute you’re sitting there in your home, and then the next. …”\nBlomberg lived next door to Eric Gavin, 45, who was killed by the tornado. Gavin’s body was found near the shattered remains of his trailer. Blomberg believes that he and his fiancée, Marissa Rhoades, would have died, too, were it not for a last-minute warning from Blomberg’s father, who called and told him to “get out of there.”\nWithout the call, Blomberg said, “We would have been right there with Eric. There’s not a shred of our trailer left.”\nBlomberg said he and Gavin were co-workers who worked the night shift at the big Jennie-O Turkey Store factory in nearby Barron. Blomberg said Gavin may have been sleeping when the twister hit.\n“He was a great guy,” Blomberg said. “Very charismatic. He’d always give you a wave and a smile.”\n‘Our park was gone’\nSirens went off Tuesday in the Chetek area 110 miles northeast of the Twin Cities about 25 minutes before the powerful storm hit about 5:33 p.m. The National Weather Service said the tornado generated winds exceeding 120 miles per hour, rating it a strong EF2.\nThe same tornado that destroyed the mobile home park also devastated a neighboring Jennie-O turkey farm, destroying four barns and severely damaging two.\nSeveral families, meanwhile, said they escaped injury simply by jumping in their cars and speeding away. The mobile home park has no tornado shelter.\nEd Sonnenberg and his family were among those who got away.\nSonnenberg has had nightmares about tornadoes ever since he lived through one as a preschooler. Late Tuesday afternoon, those fears became reality as he packed his family — wife, mother-in-law and three kids — into their van after the tornado warning sirens sounded.\nAs the van sped from the park, it ran straight into a wall of hail. Convinced they were heading into the worst of the storm, the family turned back toward home. When they arrived, “our park was gone,” Sonnenberg said.\nSonnenberg said the twister had lifted and pushed his pickup, a Ford F-250 weighing about three tons, 15 feet from where it had been parked. All the pickup’s windows were shattered.\nWith their home in ruins, Sonnenberg said he and his family plan to stay with friends and begin looking for a house. “We wanted to get out of the trailer park,” he said, “but not like that.”\nBack at what remained of the Rutledge home Wednesday, Cindy and Deeann Rutledge burrowed into the master bedroom, calling out their finds to each other as they discovered items worth keeping.\nThey dug up Cindy’s bag of medicine, including insulin. The deed to the home. Cindy’s Ouija board. Doug’s smokes. The TV remote.\n“Baby Clyde!” Cindy called out excitedly. “Baby Clyde!” She tossed the stuffed monkey, one of Colby’s favorite toys, to Mary. As they continued to dig, rain began to fall. Deeann cut her hand on a shard of broken mirror.\nLater in the evening, as rain fell and picked up strength, the Rutledges returned to the emergency shelter in the nearby town of Cameron. There had been talk at the shelter that all the missing dogs at Prairie Lake Estates had been reunited with their owners.\nNot so, Cindy Rutledge said with a sad shake of her head.\n“Colby,” she said, “is still missing.”"},{"url":"http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2017/0531/Michigan-s-new-water-battle-How-much-of-it-should-Nestle-bottle","title":"Michigan’s new water battle: How much of it should Nestle bottle?","author_text":"The Christian Science Monitor","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Christian Science Monitor","description":"The company says pumping more groundwater won't hurt the environment. But public opposition is significant, amplified in part by the Flint crisis.","date":"2017-05-31","full_text":"This time the battle is over the bottling of Michigan groundwater by Nestle, the Swiss multinational food company. Nestle is seeking permission to extract more water from an existing well about 100 miles from Flint, for sale in the Midwest. As long as it passes review, the expansion would only incur a nominal permit fee, to the dismay of critics who argue that Michigan is handing over its natural resources to a corporation for a song.\nThere is no direct link between Flint’s municipal water crisis and Nestle’s pumping permit. But the emotions stirred by the mismanagement in Flint, and concern over how regulators failed to stop it, have combined to make Nestle a lightning rod for environmentalists and a potential test case for how that most basic of natural resources – groundwater – should be managed.\n“Flint has changed the conversation,” says Liz Kirkwood, director of FLOW, an advocacy group in Traverse City, Mich., that has contested Nestle’s application.\nIn fact, officials in Osceola Township near the Nestle plant voted in April to deny the company a zoning permit to build a booster station so that it could handle additional flow from its wells. Nestle, which hopes to nearly double its permitted flow to 400 gallons per minute from its White Pines well, is appealing that decision.\nAlthough bottlers like Nestle don’t use nearly as much water as farms or factories, the dispute is calling attention to how water is regulated in the US. State laws typically offer wide latitude for property owners to pump groundwater for personal or business use.\nNestle has argued that its increase wouldn’t put the environment at risk. Still, the company seems to concur with critics on one point – that the Flint crisis has altered the zeitgeist here.\n“What happened in Flint is a tragedy … we feel frustration about this,” says Nelson Switzer, chief sustainability officer for Nestle Waters North America. He points out that Nestle and other companies have donated bottled water to the city, which he visited in February.\n“Water is a passionate issue,” he adds. “People make decisions based on their data and their knowledge, and they make decisions based on passion and their emotional responses.”\nLike many well-watered states, Michigan allows a reasonable use of water by landowners and imposes no royalties for its resale. The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) must sign off on large withdrawals to make sure stream flows and fish populations aren’t adversely affected. The cost to Nestle? A $5,000 application fee, plus an annual $200 water-use reporting fee.\n“That’s the real head-scratcher for folks,” says Nick Schroeck, who directs the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center at Wayne State University in Detroit.\nHe points to the Flint crisis and tensions over municipal fees in Detroit – nearly 18,000 customers faced shutoffs last month for years of nonpayment – as the backdrop to the outcry over Nestle’s right to pump more at minimal cost. “In a region where we are water rich and you have incredible water resources, it seems that the law protects certain users and not other users,” he says.\nDebating the impacts – and the fees\nNestle’s critics also say that, even in water-rich Michigan, environmental risks are greater than Nestle has allowed.\n“Based on direct observation of the lowering of the water table ... we believe that these [nearby] wetland areas will likely be significantly impacted by the observed and predicted lowering of the water table at this location,” Christopher Grobbel, an environmental consultant to the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center, wrote in a February comment to the DEQ.\nIn Michigan and across the US, the typical residential water bill is more about treatment and delivery than the water itself. When it comes to commercial use, some states charge a sliding fee to bottlers for water extraction. In Maine, Nestle pays towns for water rights and markets the product as Poland Spring, a best-selling brand. Elsewhere, the company has also faced pushback. Last year voters in Oregon's Hood River County passed a ballot initiative to block a proposed Nestle bottling plant amid intense business lobbying.\nEnvironmentalists are divided on the question of whether it makes sense to charge for groundwater, as states impose royalties on oil or minerals. Some are wary of putting a price on such a vital resource. The idea also raises complex questions about what water use should and shouldn’t be taxed in the public interest.\nBottled water represents a fraction of Michigan’s groundwater consumption – less than 1 percent in 2015, compared with 39 percent for agriculture and 26 percent for public waterworks, as in Flint. But its visibility makes its marketers a target in a way that doesn’t apply to cherry farmers.\n“We are the largest food and beverage company in the world so attaching our name to something does bring greater scrutiny and attention,” says Mr. Switzer.\nAn added wrinkle in Michigan is that it belongs to the Great Lakes compact of eight states along with the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. This commits members to binding rules on managing their common resources, including not diverting water from the Great Lakes basin, which holds roughly 6,000 trillion gallons of water, the world’s largest such resource. But the 2008 compact inserted a loophole for bottlers that allows for its diversion in small containers.\n‘There was outrage’\nSince Nestle filed its application last July, the DEQ has twice had to extend the period for public comment and to collect more data from Nestle. It has received more than 50,000 comments, including remarks made last month at a hearing in a town near the White Pine Spring where the wellhead is located. At least 450 people showed up for the hearing, which ran past midnight to allow everyone a turn at the microphone.\n“There was outrage,” says Ms. Kirkwood, who attended the forum and whose group has collected signatures opposing a well increase. “You have a multibillion-dollar company like Nestle coming to Michigan, basically taking our water for free, and selling it back to us in bottles for millions of dollars in profit. The public is sophisticated and they understand that is not just.”\nA spokeswoman for the DEQ says there’s no set time frame for the approval process for Nestle, which is the first under a state law amended in 2008.\nFollow Stories Like This\nSign Up\nEven if state approval comes through, another hurdle for Nestle is the local resistance to its planned booster station for the water flow. Workarounds such as trucking the water are possible, but costly.\n“If we are successful with the permitted capacity increase, what you need is a boost along that pipeline,” says Arlene Anderson-Vincent, natural resources manager at Nestle’s plant in Stanwood, Mich."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/17/ohio-drugs-child-protection-workers","title":"‘It’s just horrific’: caseworkers break their silence to reveal toll of addiction on children","author_text":"Bryan Mealer","keywords":["Ohio","Drugs","Parents And Parenting","Family","Children","Us News"],"publication_text":"the Guardian","description":"The number of drug-exposed babies in child protection custody in Ohio has jumped over 200%. Workers agreed to break protocol to tell their stories","date":"2017-05-17","full_text":"Inside the Clinton County child protection office, the week has been tougher than most.\nCaseworkers in this thinly populated region of southern Ohio, east of Cincinnati, have grown battle-weary from an opioid epidemic that’s leaving behind a generation of traumatized children. Drugs now account for nearly 80% of their cases. Foster-care placements are at record levels, and the number of drug-exposed newborns in their custody has jumped over 200% in the past decade. Funding, meanwhile, hasn’t budged in years.\n“Many of our children have experienced such high levels of trauma that they can’t go into traditional foster homes,” said Kathi Spirk, director of Clinton County job and family services. “They need more specialized care, which is very expensive.”\nThe problem is so dire that workers agreed to break protocol and invite a reporter to camp out in a conference room and hear their stories. For three days, they relived their worst cases and unloaded their frustrations, in scenes that played out like marathon group therapy, for which they have no time. Many agreed that talking about it only made them feel worse, yet still they continued, one after another.\nHence the bad week.\nGiven the small size of their community, they asked that their names be changed out of concern for their own safety and the privacy of the children.\nThe caseworkers, like most, are seasoned in despair. Many worked in the 1990s when crack cocaine first arrived, followed by crystal meth in the early 2000s. In 2008, after the shipping giant DHL shuttered its domestic hub here in Wilmington and shed more than 7,000 jobs, prescription pill mills flourished while the economy staggered. Back then, a typical month saw 30 open cases, only a few of them drug-related.\nBut the flood of cheap heroin and fentanyl, now at its highest point yet, has changed everything. A typical month now brings four times as many cases, while institutional knowledge has been flipped on its head.\n“At least with meth and cocaine, there was a fight,” said Laura, a supervisor with over 20 years of experience. “Parents used to challenge you to not take their kids. And now you have them say: ‘Here’s their stuff. Here’s their formula and clothes.’ They’re just done. They’re not going to fight you any more.”\nHeroin has changed how they approach every step of their jobs, they said, from the first intake calls to that painstaking decision to place a child into temporary foster care or permanent custody. Intake workers now fear what used to be routine.\n“Occasionally, we’d get thrown a dirty house, something easy to close and with little trauma to the child,” said Leslie, another worker. “We’re not getting those any more. Now they’re all serious, and most of them have a drug component. So you may get a dirty house, but it’s never just a dirty house.”\n‘I had a four-year old whose mom had died in front of her and she described it like it was nothing’\nChildren come into the system in two ways. The first is through a court order after caseworkers deem their environment unsafe, and if no friends or family can be found.\nBecause of the added trauma, removing a child is always the last option, caseworkers said. But in a county with only 42,000 people spread out over 400 square miles, the magnitude of the epidemic has compromised an already delicate safety net. Relatives are overwhelmed financially. Multiple generations are now addicted, along with cousins, uncles, and neighbors. In many cases, a safe house with a grandparent or other relative will eventually attract drug activity.\nLaw enforcement will also bring children in, usually after parents overdose. These cases often reveal the most horrendous neglect: a three-year old who needed every tooth pulled because he’d never been made to brush them, or kids found sleeping on bug-infested mattresses, going to the toilet in buckets because the water had been shut off. Children are coming in more hardened, they said, older than their years.\n“I had a four-year-old whose mom had died in front of her and she described it like it was nothing,” said Bridgette, another caseworker. “She knew how to roll up a dollar bill and snort white powder off the counter. That’s what she thought dollar bills were for.” She added that many of the children could detail how to cook heroin. One foster family had a five-year-old boy who put his medicine dropper in his shoe. “Because that’s where daddy hid his needles,” she said.\n“The kids are used to surviving in that mess,” added Carole, another veteran. “Now all the sudden the system is going in and saying it’s not safe. All their survival instincts are taken away and they go ballistic. They don’t know what to do.”\nDuring the first weeks of foster care, meltdowns, tantrums, and violence are common as children navigate new landscapes and begin to process what they’ve experienced.\nOne afternoon, the caseworkers brought in a foster couple who’d taken in two sisters, an infant born drug-exposed, and her four-year old sister. The baby had to be weaned off opioids and now suffered chronic respiratory problems. Part of her withdrawal had included non-stop hiccups. The older girl had lived with her parents in a drug house and displayed clear signs of post-traumatic stress. Once, a family friend sitting next to her in a car had overdosed and turned purple. She’d witnessed domestic abuse, and one day a neighbor shot and killed her dog while she watched (she’d let the dog out). After a meltdown at a classmate’s pool party, over a year after entering foster care, she revealed having seen a toddler drown in a pond while adults got high. Through therapy, she’d also revealed sexual assault. The foster mother described how the girl suffered flashbacks, triggered by stress and certain anniversaries, like the day of her removal, and other seemingly random events. When this happened, she slipped into catatonic seizures.\n“Her eyes are closed and you can’t wake her,” she said. “It’s like narcolepsy, a deep, unconscious sleep. We later discovered it was a coping mechanism she’d developed in order to survive.”\nDespite what they’ve endured, most children wish desperately to return to their parents. Many come to see themselves as their parents’ caretakers and feel guilty for being taken away, especially if they were the ones to report an overdose, as in the case of a four-year-old girl who climbed out of a window to alert a neighbor. “She asked me: if I took her away, who was going to take care of mommy?” Bridgette remembered.\nFor caseworkers, reunification is the endgame. After children enter temporary foster care, the agency spends up to two years working closely with the family while the parents try to stay sober. The only contact with their children comes in the form of twice-weekly visits held in designated rooms here at the office. Each contains a tattered sofa and some second-hand toys. Currently, the agency runs about 200 visits each week. The encounters are monitored through closed-circuit cameras. For everyone involved, it can be the most trying period.\nMany parents use the time to build trust and re-establish bonds. “During those first four years, a child gets such good stuff from their parents,” said Sherry, the caseworker who monitors the visits. “The kids are just trying to get that back.” Some parents bring doughnuts and pictures, while others need more guidance. Caseworkers hold parenting classes. Some moms lost newborns at the hospital after they tested positive for drugs; workers teach them how to feed and hold the child, and encourage them to bring outfits to dress their babies.\nFor other children, the visits trigger a storm of emotion that churns up the trauma of removal. “We had one girl who’d scream and wail at the end of every visit,” Laura, the supervisor, remembered. “Each time she thought she’d never see her mother again. We’d have to pry her out of mom’s arms and carry her down the hallway.”\n“We’d sit in our offices and just sob,” added another worker. “But that girl’s cries weren’t enough to keep Mom off heroin.”\nThe number of available foster families is dwindling, while the cost of supporting them has never been higher\nPerhaps the greatest difference with heroin and opioids, caseworkers said, is their iron grasp. Staying sober is a herculean task, especially in this rural community short on resources, where the nearest treatment facilities are over 30 miles away in Dayton, Cincinnati, or Columbus. At some point, nearly every parent falls off the wagon. They disappear and miss visits, leaving children to wait. One of the hardest parts of the job is telling a child that mom or dad isn’t coming, or that they can’t even be found.\n“You see the hurt in their eyes,” Sherry said. “It’s a look of defeat, and it just breaks your heart.” She remembered a mother who’d failed to show up for months, then made it for her twin boys’ birthday. “The next day she overdosed and died.”\nWhen parents fail drug screenings during the 18-month period, caseworkers use discretion. Parents might be doing better in other areas like landing a job, or finding secure housing, so workers help them to get back on the wagon. “It’s all about showing progress,” Laura said. Some parents make it 16, 17 months sober and fully engaged. “And they’re the toughest cases, because we’ve been rooting for them this whole time and helping them. We’re giving kids pep talks, saying: ‘Mom’s doing great, she’s getting it together!’ They’re so happy to be going home. And then it all falls apart.”\nWith heroin, defeat is something the workers have learned to reckon with. Lately they’ve started snapping photos of parents and children during their first visit together, getting medical histories and other vital information – something they used to do much later. “Because we know the parents probably aren’t going to make it,” Laura admitted. “And if we never see them again, this is the info we need.” When asked how many opioid cases had ended in reunification, only two workers raised their hands.\nThe repeated disappointments come as resources and morale have reached their tipping point. The number of available foster families is dwindling, they said, while the cost of supporting them – over $1.5m a year – has never been higher.\nSpirk, the agency’s director, said that all the agency’s budget was paid for with federal dollars and a county tax levy, although they’ve been flat-funded for nearly 10 years. The state contributes just 10%. When it comes to investing in child protection, Ohio ranks last in the country – despite having spent nearly $1bn fighting its opioid problem in 2016 alone.\nThe Ohio house of representatives recently passed a new state budget with an additional $15m for child protective services, but the state senate has yet to pass its own version. The only bit of hope came in March, when the Ohio attorney general’s office announced a pilot program that will give Clinton County, along with others, additional resources to help treat children for trauma, and to assist with drug treatment. It starts in October.\nThe epidemic’s unrelenting barrage has also taken a toll on mental health. “Our caseworkers are experiencing secondary trauma and frustration at not being able to reunify children with their parents because of relapses,” Spirk said.\nAlmost every caseworker said they had experienced depression or some form of PTSD, although no one had sought professional help. The privacy of their cases also means that few can speak openly with friends or family members. Some chose to drink, while others leaned on their faiths. But most said coping mechanisms they once relied on had failed.\n“I used to have a routine on my drive home,” Laura said. “I’d stop in front of a church, roll down my window, and throw out all the day’s problems. The next morning I’d pick them back up. These days, I can’t do that anymore.”\n“There’s no more outlet,” added Shelly, another supervisor. “You think you’re able to separate but you can’t let it go anymore. You try to eat healthy, do yoga, whatever they tell you to do. But it’s just so horrific now, and it keeps getting worse.”\nAt some point, the inevitable happens. When a parent can’t stay sober, or stops showing progress, the decision is made to place the child into permanent custody and put them up for adoption. For everyone, including caseworkers, it’s the most wrenching day.\nThe final act of every case is the “goodbye visit”, held in one of the nicer conference rooms. It’s a chance for parents to let their children know they love them and will miss them, and that it’s time to move on. Adoptive parents can choose to stay in contact, but it isn’t mandatory.\nTo make the time less stressful, Sherry, the worker who monitors the visits, has them draw pictures together, which she scans and gives to them as mementoes. She also tapes the meetings for them to keep. Watching from her tiny room full of TV screens, she can’t help but cry. “What people don’t realize is that when a baby comes into our custody, they’re still in a carrier seat. By the time the case is over, we’ve helped to potty train them. Two years is a very long time with a child. So in a way, it’s like my goodbye visit, too.”\nCaseworkers have started making “life books” for kids once they come into the system. It’s where they put the photos they’ve taken, plus any pictures of birth parents or relatives they can find, report cards, ribbons and medals – the souvenirs of any childhood.\n“It’s their history,” Sherry said, “so that one day they can make sense of their lives.”\nShe noted that one kid, after turning 18, tore his to pieces, taking with him only the good memories."},{"url":"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/05/cleveland_barbershop_evacuated.html#incart_river_home_pop","title":"Road closed after building partially collapses on Cleveland's East Side","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"cleveland.com","description":"Emergency crews evacuated a Cleveland barbershop after the building partially caved in Monday afternoon.","date":"","full_text":"CLEVELAND, Ohio - No one was injured when a building partially collapsed Monday afternoon in Cleveland's Fairfax neighborhood, a fire department spokesman said.\nInspectors have not yet determined what caused the building on East 83rd Street at Cedar Avenue to partially collapse, Cleveland Fire Department spokesman Larry Gray said.\nThe building houses The Rose of Sharon Barber Salon.\nCrews closed East 83rd Street between Cedar Avenue and Carnegie Avenue.

Delores Connors, the class’s reading instructor, couldn’t figure out why. What was so captivating about a defunct federal penitentiary?\nWhen Connors asked the kids to share what they were reading, the girl’s arm shot into the air. “I really like this book,” she announced, showing her classmates a picture of a cell. “Now I know what it looks like where my dad sleeps.” Connors tensed. She didn’t want the girl to disclose too much. As the daughter of a convict (Connors’s mother was incarcerated while pregnant with her), she wanted the girl to feel dignified talking about her dad, the way other children are.\n“From that moment, I began to think, ‘How many other kids don’t share?’” Connors wondered.\nShe teamed up with her colleague Mary Joyce Laqui to ease communication about loved ones who are locked up, launching the greeting card line Write to Matter. Inscribed with Hallmark-style messages, the notes cut past stereotypes about the incarcerated as dangerous criminals to express affection for people who’ve made a mistake. While the enterprise is still in its infancy, it could eventually provide an invaluable service to those dealing with the corrections industry, including an estimated 44 percent of black women with a family member behind bars.\n“Our greeting card line came out of that need, people who need to be able to communicate with their loved ones,” Connors says. “Because when your family member or the person you love gets in trouble, you still have to show up at work. Your church member knows your son got arrested; they don’t want to mention it, but they want to say something. The cards give us access to do that.”\nThe schoolteachers initially stamped the cards’ front cover with their own artwork. But after meeting an artist through Fortune Society, they’re pairing with inmates (current or former) who provide photos and drawings that adorn the outsides.\nAt first, Connors and Laqui set up Write to Matter as a social enterprise, selling cards at a profit that could be reinvested in the company’s operations. But something felt wrong about charging a fee. Now in the process of applying for nonprofit status, the teachers send cards to whomever emails them.

When the soda conglomerate —“Big Soda” in Jim Kenney parlance—announced 80 to 100 layoffs at area distribution plants due to the effects of the soda tax, Mayor Kenney and his minions questioned Pepsi’s intentions. “[Beverage companies] are so committed to stopping this tax from spreading to other cities, that they are not only passing the tax they should be paying onto their customer, they are actually willing to threaten working men and women’s jobs rather than marginally reduce their seven figure bonuses,” said Kenney.\nNext came ShopRite grocer Jeff Brown, who has long brought healthy, fresh, affordable food into Philadelphia’s food deserts—and who once was singled out by President Obama during a State of the Union address. In other words, Brown has spent a career serving the heart of Kenney’s constituency. Surely he’d be harder to vilify than the suits peddling sugary soda? Yet, when Brown spoke out against the tax—citing a 15 percent bottom line downturn—the Mayor similarly questioned Brown’s motives: “From the retailer side, guys like Jeff Brown, he just opened a store inside the city limits,” Kenney said, neglecting to mention that the planning for Brown’s new Fresh Grocer on Monument Road predated even the proposal of a soda tax. “He’s talking on one hand about cutting employee hours, and on the other hand he’s opening a new store.” (A City Hall insider reports that the Mayor recently reached out to Brown; the conversation did not go well).\nThis week, Temple University found itself in Kenney’s crosshairs, after its Chief Financial Officer attributed the school’s increase in boarding costs to what he identified as a $400,000 per semester cost due to the tax. As in the other cases, Kenney responded as if he were a certain orange-haired, sneering chief executive, attacking the messenger. Temple wasn’t reacting to a new economic reality, the Mayor’s office would have us believe; it was being greedy.\nIt’s common to hear nowadays just how President Trump is betraying his working class voters, now that we see the degree to which Trumpcare will transfer wealth up to the 1 percent. It would be remiss not to hold Kenney to the same scrutiny, now that it’s becoming clear that his soda tax is disproportionately and adversely affecting his working class constituency.\n“Universities still want to pay for their ever-growing administrative salaries and new, expensive buildings and amenities,” said Kenney spokeswoman Lauren Hitt, who, Kellyanne Conway to Kenney’s Trump, made sure to mention the school’s “new 24-story dorm” that “includes flat screen TVs.” She went so far as to point out the school is hoping to build an on-campus football stadium—something for which they’d need the Mayor’s help.\nIt was knee-jerk, Trump-like bullying, and it worked: Within hours, Temple released a statement saying they’d take another look at their calculations, essentially backing down. It reminded me of when, prior to the passage of the soda tax, Kenney showed up to a meeting with soda bottler honcho Harold Honickman with labor leader John Dougherty by his side. Honickman might have been forgiven had he inferred from Johnny Doc’s presence an ominous message: Nice little soda bottling operation you have here, it would be a shame if something were to happen to it. The Kenney playbook, it seems—not unlike the President’s—is not to find consensus, but to hunker down, attack, bully, and spin.\nThe more I think about it, the more the Trump analogy holds. Both the Mayor and the President seem not to be reveling in their jobs. Kenney’s joylessness prompted former Mayor and Governor Ed Rendell to wonder whatever happened to the “Happy Warrior;” Trump’s perpetual scowl has unleashed anger in the land, and—on the positive side—given us a helluva impersonation by Alec Baldwin.\nMoreover, both men are practiced at the art of the political bait and switch. Yes, Jim Kenney campaigned on funding Pre-K, something many of us were excited to support. But throughout the campaign, the funding mechanism was to be zero-based budgeting, not a new, regressive tax on his voters. It’s common to hear nowadays just how President Trump is betraying his working class voters, now that we see the degree to which Trumpcare will transfer wealth up to the 1 percent. It would be remiss not to hold Kenney to the same scrutiny, now that it’s becoming clear that his soda tax is disproportionately and adversely affecting his working class constituency.\nUp until now, Kenney’s answer to this critique has been more spin, as when, on the night PepsiCo announced its layoffs, the Mayor’s team rushed out a press release, detailing that the city’s Pre-K program had created 191 teaching positions, 147 of which are full-time, at an average wage of $14.72 an hour—hardly equivalent to the unionized jobs with full-time benefits imperiled by the tax.\nI retain hope because, in his life on the public stage, Jim Kenney—unlike the president—has shown a capacity to grow. He ran a campaign that skillfully held together a fragile coalition of competing big-city interests; he’s brought outsider critics into government—people like Chief Integrity Officer Ellen Kaplan and former director of pre-K Anne Gemmel—indicating he can be open to other voices.\nYou might think a Mayor would react to the specter of job losses resulting from his tax policies with some introspection, and I’m not giving up hope that Jim Kenney will get there, that he will get past the denial, that he will acknowledge that any one job loss is one job loss too many and that there have been some unintended consequences in real people’s lives as a result of a policy choice he’s made.\nI retain that hope because, in his life on the public stage, Jim Kenney—unlike the president—has shown a capacity to grow. He ran a campaign that skillfully held together a fragile coalition of competing big-city interests; he’s brought outsider critics into government—people like Chief Integrity Officer Ellen Kaplan and former director of pre-K Anne Gemmel—indicating he can be open to other voices; his plan to cap I-95 and build a new waterfront park at Penn’s Landing stands out from his otherwise small-ball agenda and speaks to a bold muscle one wishes he’d flex a bit more.\nBut if we’re to get that Jim Kenney, one with vision and bold purpose, the Mayor will first have to slay his inner Trump. He’ll have to brighten up, have some fun, and say goodbye to the attacks and spin. Settling scores and bullying those with whom you disagree is not leadership. What is?

That’s partially why 63 million to 273 million sharks are killed every year in the world’s fisheries.\nBut there is hope for lowering that unsustainable mortality rate. The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), a United Nations treaty organization, is uniquely able to set measures to protect the world’s migratory animals. In recent years, this has included an ever-increasing investment in shark conservation. That trend continues this year ahead of the body’s 12th conference of the parties (CoP) in Manila, Philippines, in October: CMS member governments have submitted six proposals to protect some of the world’s most threatened sharks.\nThe Philippines, Israel and Sri Lanka have proposed prohibiting any take of whale sharks, wherever they migrate, a restriction known as a CMS Appendix I listing. Monaco has proposed that the angel shark receive a similar level of protection. The following species have been proposed for listing on CMS Appendix II, which would encourage international action to properly manage and protect these species throughout their migratory range: The common guitarfish (proposed by Senegal, Mauritania, Togo and Israel); the whitespotted wedgefish (the Philippines), dusky sharks (Honduras); and blue sharks (Samoa and Sri Lanka).\nThe world’s biggest fish—worth more in the water\nThe host government of the Philippines is already leading the way ahead of the meeting by proposing increased protections for the world’s biggest fish, the whale shark, and by including the iconic species on the CoP’s logo. These sharks are a huge ecotourism draw in the Philippines, worth more to the country alive than dead. But continued population declines globally—whale sharks are killed by ship propellers and fishing, and often when they are taken unintentionally as bycatch—led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to recently assess them as endangered.\nFin trade—the continued threat\nThe fin trade remains a huge driver of global shark declines. In recent years, several regularly traded species have gained protections through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), but many have been left unprotected and have few restrictions on their global commerce. But for regularly traded shark species that are also migratory, CMS can help prioritize better management.\nBlue sharks are the mainstay of the global shark fin trade and, as the most-traded shark, are fished heavily on the high seas. And yet none of the world’s regional fisheries management organizations has set sustainable catch limits on the species—either as a targeted species or as bycatch.\nWithout protections, even this globally abundant migratory shark will face extinction. Fortunately, Sri Lanka has proposed listing the species on CMS Appendix II.\nDusky sharks offer a cautionary tale. They are also regularly traded for their fins but, unlike blue sharks, may already be beyond help, with declines of 80 percent over large parts of their range and recovery times of more than 100 years. Still, in hopes of saving the species from extinction, Honduras has proposed listing it on CMS Appendix II.\nStrange and endangered—angels and guitars\nThe IUCN also found that angel sharks, guitarfish, and wedgefish, are among the three most vulnerable shark families, with huge population declines across their entire ranges. Senegal, Togo, Mauritania, the Philippines, Israel and Monaco proposed affording stronger protections to the common guitarfish, whitespotted wedgefish, and the angel shark at the CMS CoP.\nIn many places, species within the three families have been completely wiped out, through both targeted fishing and bycatch. Guitarfish fins, along with those from their close relatives the wedgefish, are also among the most highly valued in the global shark fin trade, and these unique families are virtually unmanaged globally.\nLooking ahead to Manila\nWhen the 124 CMS members convene Oct. 23 in Manila, they should adopt these additional listings on CMS Appendix I and II for sharks and rays, which urgently need better management globally. In doing so, CMS would carry on momentum from its own successful efforts, and those of fisheries management bodies and CITES, to protect the world’s sharks and make the entire ocean safer for those that migrate.\nLuke Warwick directs The Pew Charitable Trusts’ global shark conservation program."},{"url":"https://ensia.com/features/black-carbon","title":"On the thawing tundra, researchers race to understand black carbon’s climate impact","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Ensia","description":"The wood and fossil fuels we burn affect extreme warming in the Arctic, and solutions begin with understanding how and how much.","date":"","full_text":"On a morning in September 2015, sterile, gray Arctic light filtered through a blanket of woolly clouds as Matt Gunsch and Tate Barrett parked their rented pickup truck on a dirt road and clomped in rubber boots down a long, icy boardwalk to their air-monitoring laboratory on the tundra.\nFrom the outside, the lab looked unglamorous — a dingy, white shack perched on a metal frame in a meadow speckled with snow and grass stubble. It felt distinctly like the middle of nowhere — though it was just a couple of miles beyond the main streets of Utqiaġvik, Alaska, the northernmost town in America. Inside the shack, a cracked window was patched with red tape. There was a shelf stacked with steel-toed and military-style “bunny” boots designed for extreme cold, tables scattered with miscellaneous lab supplies, a toaster oven — and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of air-monitoring equipment whose internal motors filled the room with a constant high-pitched hum. Partially isolated from the dirt and exhaust of town, this turned out to be a good place to try to sniff out small intruders in the delicate Arctic atmosphere.\nThat summer and fall, Royal Dutch Shell was wrapping up the last of its offshore exploratory drilling in the Arctic (and would shortly announce its decision not to return). Environmentalists protested all summer and decried the potential for an oil spill — envisioning a catastrophe like the infamous Deepwater Horizon blowup of 2010, but on ice. Gunsch and Barrett, then Ph.D. students in atmospheric chemistry and environmental science respectively, were tracking a less dramatic but still insidious problem. They were searching the air for signs of black carbon, a type of air pollution also known as soot.\nBlack carbon is a product of incomplete combustion from forest fires and the burning of both wood and fossil fuels, and its influence on the Arctic is like the proverbial death by a thousand cuts. At the top of the world, black carbon can land on snow and ice, darkening them, which makes them soak up more heat from the sun and melt faster. It can also absorb and radiate heat from sunlight as it floats through the atmosphere.Black carbon may be worsening the extreme warming felt all over the Arctic, record temperatures that are making permafrost disintegrate and sea ice melt. And if the Arctic gets too much warmer, it is, in the long term, like setting off a giant Rube Goldberg machine — once Arctic ice melts, seas rise; ocean waters absorb more heat; methane, another potent greenhouse gas, escapes from the permafrost.\nThe particles that end up in the Arctic have millions of points of origin, drifting northward from sources like wood and coal stoves used for cooking in India or diesel trucks chugging down U.S. highways. But any particles produced in the Arctic itself are far more likely to linger here and become a more damaging pollution problem.\nAs the melting Arctic becomes more accessible to ships and enticing for new development, some black carbon sources in the region are increasing. But there are only a handful of research stations monitoring the impact. The Arctic is a difficult place to do research — tough to reach and subject to extreme weather that can interfere with even the best-designed equipment. Utqiaġvik is one of about a half-dozen places in the entire high-Arctic region that are capturing ongoing data on soot.\nGoing Beyond Assumptions\nScientists had been making a lot of assumptions about how black carbon ended up in the Arctic — based on estimates and sophisticated models of global air masses. But few people had actually ventured out to the tundra to measure it themselves with this level of precision. And unless scientists and policy-makers knew where the problem was coming from, it would be tough to remedy it.\nInside Gunsch and Barrett’s lab in 2015, air was sucked in through a cone-shaped duct on the roof that sorted out particles — anything about a thirtieth of the width of a human hair and smaller could get through. A set of six foil-covered tentacles dangled from the ceiling, shunting the particles between several pieces of equipment designed to sort and measure them.\nThe most obtrusive of these was “Maverick,” named affectionately after Tom Cruise’s character in the movie Top Gun — a machine made of a complex assemblage of tubes, wires and metal and mounted onto an airplane cart. Gunsch and his supervisor, Kerri Pratt, a chemistry professor at the University of Michigan, had built Maverick by hand and shipped it to the Arctic. Inside Maverick were a set of tiny discs that had to be lined up with meticulous precision so that a laser could zap every microscopic particle at the precise moment it floated into the center of the instrument. As the laser exploded particles into fragments — kind of like “the Death Star [from Star Wars] blowing apart a planet,” Gunsch says — each gave off a unique signature, a fingerprint that could tell the researchers where in the world it came from.\nMeanwhile, Barrett was working with Baylor University environmental science professor Rebecca Sheesley to collect the tiny specks that passed through another air sampler. Later, he and Sheesley would analyze them for the presence of radioactive carbon isotopes — in order to tell whether the soot came from ancient carbon (like fossil fuels) or newer sources (like forest fires).\nDespite the Space Age novelty of it all, it was tedious work. Gunsch and Barrett trekked back and forth several times a day between an old naval research station just off Utqiaġvik’s desolate, eroded beach road and the lab. They changed out thumb-sized filters made of aluminum foil, recorded weather data and crunched numbers. At night especially they kept an eye out for polar bears, although Gunsch had only ever seen a fox.\nBuying Time\nIn the past decade, researchers have been racing to understand how much of a role black carbon plays in the global climate. It’s not a simple thing to answer: Black carbon is a complicated little substance, made of assorted molecules clumped together into particles of various sizes that can travel large distances and shape-shift as they interact with water, clouds, and chemicals.\nSome scientists say black carbon could have an enormous impact on global warming, second only to carbon dioxide in its potency. Other experts think black carbon’s influence on the planet is smaller, but its effects on the Arctic itself could be noticeable. One study, published in 2015 in the journal Nature Climate Change, examined what might happen if the world reduced black carbon emissions (along with a few other more minor greenhouse gases) by about 60 percent — according to one of the authors — and made the most stringent cuts in the next 15 years. Under such a scenario, the Arctic could cool by as much as a 0.2 °C (0.36 °F) by 2050. That might sound small. But it’s a huge amount when you consider that 2 °C (3.6 °F) of atmospheric heat — a threshold long held up by several international authorities, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — is often described as the brink of global catastrophe. And the hotter it gets up north, the warmer the rest of the planet becomes.\nThough there is scientific uncertainty about its impacts, reining in black carbon could be a much more palatable political goal than tackling CO2. Globally, emissions of black carbon are already ramping down: In the U.S., for instance, they have dropped dramatically because of regulations on diesel engines.\nAnd it could be relatively simple to cut back on the sources that are most damaging to the Arctic in particular. For instance, one of the worst culprits lies in the Russian Arctic — where natural gas plants burn off waste methane, sending black carbon into the skies. That problem could be curbed with low-cost technologies that capture the gas instead, and several countries — including Russia and the United States—have endorsed an international agreement to end routine gas flaring by 2030. Another problematic source could be curtailed with a mass effort to promote and distribute cleaner-burning woodstoves in northern latitudes and more efficient cookstoves in the developing world. This would also prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths from smoke inhalation.\nIn the global scale of things, black carbon’s impact is neither as important nor as long-lasting as that of CO2. But take a bit of soot out of the air, and the effects are almost instant.\nThe short lifespan of black carbon also makes it an appealing target: A particle of soot can live in the atmosphere for only about a week, whereas a molecule of CO2 can linger there anywhere from a few decades to many millennia. In the global scale of things, black carbon’s impact is neither as important nor as long-lasting as that of CO2. But take a bit of soot out of the air, and the effects are almost instant. “We’re very clear in acknowledging that CO2 is the 800-pound gorilla in the room,” says climate science professor Mark Flanner, an author of the Nature Climate Change study. “But … maybe through selective actions [on black carbon], you can buy yourself a little bit of extra time or slow the amount of warming that will occur within the next few decades.”\nWhen black carbon is regulated, though, it’s often an afterthought. Under the Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulates black carbon as a component of “particulate matter”: Little particles are also a health hazard because they can penetrate human lung tissue, enter the bloodstream, and contribute to asthma, bronchitis, and heart and respiratory diseases.\nBut particulates are an overarching category that includes light-colored aerosols too, and not every effort to cut back on particles will also reduce black carbon. According to James Baumgartner, air regulator with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, “the state of Alaska has no applicable emission standard specific to black carbon.” In 2012, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe took on new standards to target black carbon as a component of particulate matter. Last fall, California pioneered a new law that requires a 50 percent cut in black carbon emissions by 2030.\nEarly in 2016 the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management released a proposed new rule for offshore air pollution standards for oil drilling in both Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. The agency said it was also reviewing and researching means for controlling black carbon. But members of the oil industry oppose new offshore air standards, the Trump administration has torn down numerous other Obama-era environmental regulations, and the fate of this rule is uncertain. At press time, the rule was still under review.\nIn the past few years, there have been international efforts to come up with less scattershot ways of curbing black carbon. In April 2015, more than seven months before the Paris climate agreement, the eight nations and six indigenous organizations that sit on the Arctic Council — including the United States and Russia — quietly adopted a framework agreement to “take enhanced, ambitious, national and collective action to accelerate the decline in our overall black carbon emissions.”\nIt was a “groundbreaking agreement … the first time that the Arctic Council countries had taken action on climate change,” says Erika Rosenthal, a lawyer with the organization Earthjustice. At the same time, the U.S. took over the chairmanship of the Arctic Council, and then–Secretary of State John Kerry championed climate change and saving the Arctic as among his core missions. Later that year, Obama became the first president to travel above the Arctic Circle, and under U.S. chairmanship, the Arctic Council worked on a set of science-based recommendations for cutting black carbon emissions around the world.\nNew sources of black carbon are creeping into the Arctic as the ice thaws. Between 2008 and 2012, marine traffic in the U.S. Arctic went up 108 percent.\nMuch of that progress seemed up in the air as the Arctic Council gathered last week in Fairbanks to pass the rotating chairmanship on to Finland under Prime Minister Juha Sipilä. Speaking at that meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed reluctance to make any commitments on climate change: “We’re not going to rush to make a decision,” he said. It’s still not clear whether President Donald Trump will withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, though he announced recently that he’d withhold his decision until after the Group of Seven meeting in Italy later this month.\nDespite all of that, the United States joined other Arctic nations in signing a pledge at the Arctic Council meeting that explicitly acknowledges how extreme and urgent Arctic warming is. The agreement, called the Fairbanks Declaration, adopts an “aspirational collective goal” to cut black carbon 25 to 33 percent by 2025. It’s less than what scientific models call for, but it is at least a concrete target.\n“It’s not enough, but it’s a first step,” says Rosenthal.\nUnanswered Questions\nMeanwhile, new sources of black carbon are creeping into the Arctic as the ice thaws. Between 2008 and 2012, marine traffic in the U.S. Arctic went up 108 percent. In the summer and fall of 2016, the Crystal Serenity became the first luxury cruise liner to travel across the Arctic Ocean from Alaska to New York City. In late April this year, President Trump signed an executive order with the aim of reviving offshore drilling in the Alaskan Arctic and elsewhere, a move that prompted a lawsuit from several environmental groups. Oil companies are drilling more than a dozen exploratory oil wells in the Barents Sea off the coast of Norway. In the Russian Arctic, fossil-fuel companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in a massive drilling project that will ship liquefied natural gas from the Yamal Peninsula to Europe and other parts of Asia.\nThat means that more answers are needed urgently, and scientists are scrambling to fit the rest of the puzzle pieces together.\nAs such projects charge ahead, there are still many unanswered questions about how they will affect the Arctic’s air and climate. University of Michigan’s Pratt was surprised when her data revealed that the Prudhoe Bay oil field produced vast quantities of particles that were growing and could have an impact on cloud formation — a finding she and a group of collaborators reported in a paper in December 2016. Two years ago, Baylor’s Sheesley and Barrett, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of North Texas, discovered that the major culprits dirtying Alaskan skies with black carbon in the winter lay in the North American Arctic (including Prudhoe) and the Russian Arctic — another surprise. Maverick, the particle “Death Star,” spent its second field season in 2016 at a remote U.S. Department of Energy research site, where Gunsch got a closer view of black carbon from Prudhoe.\n“Maybe this oil field is having a greater impact than we thought,” says Pratt. And if that’s true, then putting more ships, rigs, roads, drills and well pads in the Arctic could have more serious consequences than climate scientists previously understood.\nThat means that more answers are needed urgently, and scientists are scrambling to fit the rest of the puzzle pieces together. Since 2015, three scientists — one with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, one at the University of Leeds, and one with the French Laboratoire Atmosphères, Milieux, Observations Spatiales, or LATMOS — have been bringing together groups of researchers from around the world to figure out how to shine a light on unexplained questions about black carbon. Charles Brock, a NOAA research physicist, is trying to organize a project with scientists from multiple agencies that would use research airplanes to track black-carbon pollution as it travels from China, Japan, and Korea to the Arctic. Much of the research on black carbon in the U.S. relies directly or indirectly on government funding whose fate could be tenuous under the Trump administration.\nMeanwhile, the Arctic is rapidly unraveling. Since Pratt began her field work in Alaska five years ago, she’s has made several journeys into the waters of the Chukchi Sea and onto the sea ice with local guides in Utqiaġvik. “It’s actually pretty amazing. You can see the changes in the ice just in that time frame,” she said. “It’s quite shocking actually to see it firsthand.”"},{"url":"http://www.sfchronicle.com/restaurants/article/The-legend-of-Chef-Smelly-and-Oakland-s-most-11191382.php","title":"The legend of Chef Smelly and Oakland’s most popular pop-up","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"San Francisco Chronicle","description":"In a cloud of hip-hop music, raucous conversations and cigarette smoke spiraling into the downtown Oakland breeze, 50-some-odd people waited for Edward Wooley to open his one-night-a-week pop-up, Smelly’s Creole and Soul Food.  The crowd formed a haphazard line, segmented by small clusters of two, three and four people, stretching from the middle of the block at 420 14th St. to the intersection of 14th and Broadway.  A few floors above the fray in Complex, downtown Oakland’s music venue that has hosted everything from late-night performances by Houston rapper Devin the Dude to crowded raves and punk rock shows, Wooley — or Chef Smelly as he’s known in the East Bay — made final checks on a dinner service that was going to last five hours, or until the food ran out.  Playful options like the french fry appetizer — which could easily feed two — topped with heaping mounds of lobster, Angus beef, Dungeness crab and prawns ($37) are juxtaposed next to teriyaki chicken over noodles ($15).  Entrees average about $30, although there are larger platters, such as the $130 one that includes two Dungeness crabs, 10 blackened prawns and his trademark garlic noodles, which appear in a number of dishes.  More than an hour passed before I reached the restaurant’s door, and as customers walked out with either a Styrofoam container in hand or a toothpick between their lips, one thing became clear:  Outside of his kitchen, there’s a family-reunion vibe that coerces strangers to become friends during the hours-long wait to order.  “Nobody is doing what (Wooley) is doing in the Bay Area right now,” he told me as we waited in the dimly lit hallway leading up to the second floor where dinner service was in full swing.  In his voice, in the way he concocts dishes with a self-taught flair and executes them with a culinary school graduate’s eye for detail, the chef’s kitchen style is authentically East Oakland — brash, confident and unapologetic.  The women were family matriarchs who specialized in comfort food but focused on technical execution.  Wooley said his life in the neighborhood surrounding 106th Avenue and Sunnyside Street came to a crossroads several years ago when he was faced with a decision:  The money coming in from selling Creole and Southern plates out of their house was better than any of the kitchen jobs he held after culinary school.  Each Friday, the kitchen is stocked with 80 pounds of prawns, 100 pounds of crab, 60 more pounds of crab meat, 50 pounds of lobster and 120 pounds of garlic butter, among other things.  More than 44,000 people follow him on Instagram (@chefsmelly); for context, that is thousands more than notable Oakland chefs Tanya Holland, James Syhabout and Preeti Mistry, combined.  [...] in the Bay Area’s land of exorbitantly priced tasting menus, Wooley remains relatively unknown in the mainstream food landscape.  Wooley keeps an eye on people like Garrett because in his circle, crews like All Flavor No Grease represent his only competition.  Wooley doesn’t see the Bay Area’s numerous Michelin-starred and celebrity chefs as counterparts in the business, mainly because their existence spirals in a completely different realm.  While both Wooley and Garrett have taken to social media to promote their brand to immense success, Wooley said he wants to move beyond the pop-up genre and toward a permanent restaurant.  Hip-hop music, much of it featuring local artists, reverberates through the dining room thanks to a DJ booth opposite the fully stocked bar.  The conversations at tables are equally raucous, but the anxiety from the earlier lengthy wait dissipates as plates make their way to crowded tables.

You should have seen it last week,” one woman said as she led a group of three toward the back of the line.\nThe Chef Smelly pop-up landed in downtown Oakland in 2015. Over the last two years, Wooley and his skeleton crew have crafted arguably the city’s most unique blend of Creole fare bisected by Southern sensibilities.\nPlayful options like the french fry appetizer — which could easily feed two — topped with heaping mounds of lobster, Angus beef, Dungeness crab and prawns ($37) are juxtaposed next to teriyaki chicken over noodles ($15). Entrees average about $30, although there are larger platters, such as the $130 one that includes two Dungeness crabs, 10 blackened prawns and his trademark garlic noodles, which appear in a number of dishes.\nConceptually, his menu is a culinary kaleidoscope.\nOn my first visit to Smelly’s Creole and Soul Food, I showed up 15 minutes early. That wasn’t nearly early enough. More than an hour passed before I reached the restaurant’s door, and as customers walked out with either a Styrofoam container in hand or a toothpick between their lips, one thing became clear: Friday nights on 14th Street belong to Chef Smelly.\nAtmosphere plays as much a role in Wooley’s business as his food. Outside of his kitchen, there’s a family-reunion vibe that coerces strangers to become friends during the hours-long wait to order.\nThat’s where I met Webster, or Web as he preferred to be called, a youthful West Coast native who’s been coming to the pop-up for the past year. He didn’t know Chef Smelly directly but had a cousin associated with the kitchen staff. Most times, he was ushered past the crowd.\nThis time, he found himself relegated to the line for the first time, so whether Web wanted the role or not, he was my sherpa for the night.\n“Nobody is doing what (Wooley) is doing in the Bay Area right now,” he told me as we waited in the dimly lit hallway leading up to the second floor where dinner service was in full swing.\nAs Web guided me through the ins and outs of the menu — “The Extravaganza has everything: crab, lobster, shrimp”; “You have to try the cheese sauce they put on the fries” — the people around us shared stories about the chef, some being firsthand accounts, most taking shape as word-of-mouth tales. “Someone told me he cooks for the Warriors sometimes,” a young man said to his friends only a few step above us.\nIn Smelly’s comically mythical world, nothing can be written off as exaggeration. Former 49ers player Anquan Boldin was once asked where he preferred to eat in the Bay Area. The answer: wherever Wooley happened to be cooking.\nThe chef, by the way, would repeat this claim to fame himself once we finally were able to connect a few days later.\nEdward Wooley is an Oakland native through and through. In his voice, in the way he concocts dishes with a self-taught flair and executes them with a culinary school graduate’s eye for detail, the chef’s kitchen style is authentically East Oakland — brash, confident and unapologetic.\nHe comes from a family of cooks. He owes a Creole twist to his grandparents, who hailed from Louisiana (Ruston and Monroe, to be specific). His grandmother passed down recipes to his mother, who then showed him tricks of the trade. The women were family matriarchs who specialized in comfort food but focused on technical execution. Friday-night fish fries were the norm during his childhood.\nWooley said his life in the neighborhood surrounding 106th Avenue and Sunnyside Street came to a crossroads several years ago when he was faced with a decision: Keep running the streets of East Oakland “selling dope and just messing up for a while” or try something else.\nHe had already been to jail twice, and run-ins with the law were getting old. He had a young daughter, and that meant focusing on the future. And the only thing he knew better than coaching youth sports was cooking, be it for family, friends or acquaintances.\nSo Wooley made the only logical choice: He applied to culinary school.\n“When I had my daughter, I couldn’t have that lifestyle anymore. I couldn’t keep hustling on the streets. So I started selling plates,” he said.\nWooley graduated from Le Cordon Bleu in San Francisco in 2013. He held posts at a few familiar East Bay kitchens, including a stint under Oakland chef Tanya Holland at her now-closed B-Side BBQ, before joining his mom’s catering business full time.\nThe money coming in from selling Creole and Southern plates out of their house was better than any of the kitchen jobs he held after culinary school. And word spread quickly about his family’s setup.\n“I used to make this alfredo — Creole alfredo — and toss it in penne pasta. I’d put the blackened prawns on it and people were loving it. So many cars were pulling up to the house, the cops thought I was selling drugs,” Wooley said with a laugh.\nThe opportunity to take refuge in a larger space, Complex Oakland, presented itself in 2015.\nThe Complex space, while a step up from his family home, isn’t without its shortcomings. Refrigeration, for example, is a challenge. Each Friday, the kitchen is stocked with 80 pounds of prawns, 100 pounds of crab, 60 more pounds of crab meat, 50 pounds of lobster and 120 pounds of garlic butter, among other things. Luckily, the team usually exhausts its inventory these days, meaning the storage is adequate by the end of the night.\nHealth issues have kept Wooley’s mother from working at Smelly’s Creole and Soul Food since its move to downtown Oakland. But the chef still considers himself to be only one-half of the business. He tells people he’s the co-owner, out of respect for his mother.\nWooley is now two years into his pop-up life. More than 44,000 people follow him on Instagram (@chefsmelly); for context, that is thousands more than notable Oakland chefs Tanya Holland, James Syhabout and Preeti Mistry, combined. On Facebook, the Chef Smelly legion exceeds 29,000. Still, in the Bay Area’s land of exorbitantly priced tasting menus, Wooley remains relatively unknown in the mainstream food landscape.\nHis type of stardom is reminiscent of Keith Garrett, the man behind upstart All Flavor No Grease in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, known for its tacos, burritos and quesadillas.\nWooley keeps an eye on people like Garrett because in his circle, crews like All Flavor No Grease represent his only competition. Wooley doesn’t see the Bay Area’s numerous Michelin-starred and celebrity chefs as counterparts in the business, mainly because their existence spirals in a completely different realm.\nWhile both Wooley and Garrett have taken to social media to promote their brand to immense success, Wooley said he wants to move beyond the pop-up genre and toward a permanent restaurant.\n“I’m not satisfied with where I am right now. I would want something bigger: my own solo restaurant in the downtown Oakland area, since I’m from Oakland and it’s booming with its culinary scene right now,” he said.\nAnd the rumors about cooking for Warriors players? Wooley said those are true. He even has a meeting on the books with one of the team’s players. On the night I visited, Oakland rapper Mistah F.A.B. and Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters both made visits.\nThe atmosphere outside of Complex Oakland seeps into Wooley’s pop-up as the night goes on. Hip-hop music, much of it featuring local artists, reverberates through the dining room thanks to a DJ booth opposite the fully stocked bar. The conversations at tables are equally raucous, but the anxiety from the earlier lengthy wait dissipates as plates make their way to crowded tables.\n“This isn’t even the most crowded I’ve ever seen it,” Web told me as we finally made it to the front of the line.\nSmelly’s come-up story in the East Bay food scene, one that ties back to his decision to create a better life for himself and his family, was years in the making. Now, it’s the stuff of legend.\nAt one point during the dinner service, Wooley strolled out to survey the crowd and greet a few guests, the blue sleeves of his chef’s jacket rolled up at the elbows, a hair net covering his tapered mohawk. After a few minutes, he disappeared back into the kitchen.\nSmelly’s Creole and Soul Food: 5-10 p.m. every Friday night at 420 14th St., Oakland.\nJustin Phillips is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The town of Winchester tweeted last night that there was minor flooding along the brook, but tweeted later that the problem had been stabilized and there was no flooding.\nMaddie Kilgannon can be reached at maddie.kilgannon@globe.com.

It has asked the court to confirm the tribe's ownership and deny the city any ownership or rights to the land. That incudes a vacant 9-acre site, which city officials also hope to have developed.\nCity officials are negotiating a development and tax-incentives agreement with First Hartford Realty Corp., a Connecticut real estate and retail development company, to do a mixed-use project on the vacant 30-acre site adjacent to Blackie Chesher Park.\nLOOKING BACK:\nJessica Herrera, interim director of the city Economic and International Development Department, did not know Friday how the Tiguas' lawsuit would affect her department's plan to have the development agreement completed soon so it could be taken to the City Council for approval.\nThe City Attorney's Office had no immediate comments Friday about the lawsuit.\nThe proposed mixed-use project would possibly include retail, restaurant, hotel and entertainment uses, according to a presentation Herrera made to the City Council in April.\nDolph Barnhouse, an Albuquerque lawyer representing the Tiguas in its land lawsuit filed May 22 in federal court in El Paso, said the Tiguas had been negotiating with city officials for more than a year to \"acquire the property through a negotiated settlement\" and, he said, develop the vacant land in cooperation with the city.\nThe Tiguas want to get their land back, \"but they also realized the best way to get things done is through cooperation\" with the city, Barnhouse said. \"The city pulled the rug out from them.\"\nThe Tiguas were working with the City Attorney's Office to acquire the vacant, 9-acre site with the understanding that the city would then work with the Tiguas on acquiring the adjacent 30-acre site, Barnhouse said.\n\"It was not until the city started adding additional restrictions on the 9-acre site\" to benefit First Hartford that the Tiguas learned of the city's change in position, Barnhouse said in an email.\nThe Tiguas knew for years that the land was owned by the tribe, but a yearslong legal fight with the Texas attorney general tied to gambling issues at the Tiguas' Speaking Rock Entertainment Center made it difficult for the tribe to take on other legal battles, Barnhouse said.\nMORE BUSINESS NEWS:\nThe state fight came to a close in March when U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone declared the state's 18-year-old gambling lawsuit against the Tiguas closed.\nThe Tiguas' land ownership claim also was strengthened in late February when Cardone, in a different lawsuit, issued an order confirming the Tiguas own an almost 1-acre portion of South Old Pueblo Drive in the Lower Valley under the tribe's 1751 Spanish land grant.\nThat order came in a 2016 lawsuit the tribe filed against El Paso Electric, Texas Gas Service, the city of El Paso and El Paso County in which the tribe disputed that those organizations have any ownership in the road.\nThe tribe's ownership of land under the Spanish land grant can't be taken away from the tribe without federal approval, and in the case of the acreage at I-10 and Zaragoza, no such approval has been granted, Barnhouse said.\nHerrera, the city economic development official, said the city acquired the vacant land from the Public Service Board, which oversees El Paso Water, the city's water, sewage and stormwater utility.\n\"This is a perfect opportunity to increase the (city's) sales and property tax base\" by having the site developed, Herrera said.\nCity economic development officials approached First Hartford about the possibility of doing a project at the I-10 and Zaragoza site because city officials have built a good relationship with the company as it developed CVS Pharmacy stores in El Paso, Herrera said. And it has retail projects in other markets, she added.\nFirst Hartford has three shopping centers in Texas and New Orleans under development and a modest portfolio of seven shopping centers it's been operating for years, according to its website.\nIts largest shopping center is the 450,000-square-foot Shoppes at Rio Grande Valley in Edinburg, Texas, anchored by J.C. Penney, Burlington Coat Factory, and Academy Sports and Outdoors. The company has plans to expand the center to more than one million square feet.\nThe expansion is to include adding a 120-room Wyndham Garden Hotel by summer 2019, said First Hartford President John Toic.\nFirst Hartford also does store development and relocation for CVS Pharmacy in Connecticut, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York and Texas. The company became familiar with El Paso when it developed six CVS store sites in the city. It no longer will be the CVS store developer in El Paso after it completes development of a store at Montana Avenue and Chelsea Street in Central El Paso.\n\"We feel that the (I-10/Zaragoza) site has excellent visibility and accessibility, and is an attractive location for retail development,\" Toic said in an email. \"We envision a mix of entertainment, restaurant and retail spaces with potential for a hotel use as well.\"\nToic said Saturday that First Hartford was not aware of the Tiguas' lawsuit. He said he could not comment about what the lawsuit may mean for the proposed project until the company has a chance to review the issue.\nThe vacant land is just across Interstate 10 from a highly developed area that includes the Las Palmas Marketplace shopping center with a 20-screen Cinemark movie theater and dozens of stores and restaurants. Two hotels also have opened in the past few years at George Dieter Drive and I-10, directly across I-10 from the city's proposed mixed-use project site.\nMore information: firsthartford.com\nVic Kolenc may be reached at 546-6421; vkolenc@elpasotimes.com; @vickolenc on Twitter."},{"url":"http://wamu.org/story/17/05/23/bowie-state-holds-commencement-ceremony-empty-chair","title":"Bowie State Holds A Commencement Ceremony — With An Empty Chair | WAMU","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"WAMU","description":"Richard Collins III received his degree posthumously on the same campus where he was murdered over the weekend.","date":"","full_text":"Bowie State University held its commencement ceremony Tuesday but for the school’s some 650 latest graduates, the normally festive occasion was also one of mourning.\nDraped over a front-row chair was the black robe and colorful stole that Richard Collins III was supposed to wear to the ceremony.

A Saturday night BoDeans concert sold out, drawing a large happy crowd of well over 500.\nThat's the way new owner Wagner wants the summers to be at the Casino, which gets its name from being a gathering place rather than a gambling hall. The Casino is one the last remaining dance halls of its type — not unlike the famous Surf Ballroom in Iowa that hosted Buddy Holly's last show.\n\"This used to be the entertainment hub for central Wisconsin,\" said Wagner, who brings experience in real estate development, the bar and restaurant business, and social media savvy to a very old business.\n\"I'm very choosy in the place I pick,\" he said. \"It's got to have an amazing, unique feature.\"\nIn the case of the Casino, there are several such features, including a waterfront porch and grounds, and a large auditorium with a wooden floor that just begs to be danced on. Performers admire the acoustics of the room.\n\"That channel out front is the main highway for these lakes,\" Wagner said. \"And the size of that room gives you the opportunity to be able to bring in national acts.\"\nIt's not that the joint has been closed, but in recent years visitors to this busy summer vacation area were uncertain when the Casino would be open. That's in part because it's a popular spot for wedding receptions, and the previous owners would close to the public on those nights.\nThat will change under Wagner, who owns two bars in Oshkosh — Bar 430 and Peabody's Ale House.\nWagner has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into Casino renovations, including a new kitchen and beer garden. It's a gutsy move for a seasonal business that's heavily dependent on the weather.\n\"We're going to be open every day, even on days when we have a wedding reception,\" Wagner said.\nThat's great news to generations of visitors who have memories of summer nights hanging out on the Casino's porch, overlooking the channel connecting Columbia and Limekiln lakes.\n\"This is going to be great,\" said Mark Kellermann, 67, of Neenah, as he surveyed a freshly landscaped beer garden overlooking Columbia Lake. \"If he gets some good bands here, he's going to do really well.\"\nWagner's day job is as vice president of operations for a web development company that's based in California. He's promoting the refreshed Casino on Facebook and on local radio, which is where Kellermann heard about it.\nThe Casino opened on July 4, 1925 — before the big band era —- and featured \"programs that would be of interest to most of the dancing public,\" according to a Waupaca County Post article.\n\"Monday nights were billed as 'Waltz Nights,' \" the article says. \"Every other dance would be a waltz, and a waltz contest would be held at 10:30, with prizes given.\"\nWednesday and Friday evenings were “Get Acquainted Nights” and admission was \"50 cents for gents and 35 cents for ladies.\"\nOver the years, the Casino hosted shows by Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and acts like the Everly Brothers and Buffalo Springfield. An undated poster from the '60s promotes a Beach Boys show. Admission: $2.\nWagner has acts booked throughout the summer and has worked with general manager Dion Block to create a menu that doesn't disrupt other area businesses, such as the nearby Wheel House, which specializes in pizza.\n\"We want to be part of something that's already really great,\" Wagner said of the Chain O'Lakes.\nThe improvements made by Wagner are impressive, said previous owner Maria Behlke.\n\"It's been a part of our lives for so long,\" said Behlke, who had owned the Casino and adjacent Ding's Dock boat rental business with husband Bill since the early 1980s.\n\"He's younger and has a lot of good ideas.

And like any popular shark these days, she has her own Twitter handle — @MaryLeeShark. She can be followed on Twitter as she cruises the East Coast shoreline of the U.S., according to her social media description.\nOcearch has tracked about 300 sharks over the years. It has been tracking Mary Lee since she was tagged in 2012 with a GPS-like tracking device. When one of their tagged sharks is spotted, they refer to it as a “ping.”\nMary Lee has been tracked several times over the years along the East Coast. Last week, the shark had a ping along Assateague Island and another near Chincoteague.\nOther great white sharks have been tracked along the Delaware and Virginia coasts, but this one is larger than others that have gained social media fame. There was Yeti, an 11-foot, 960-pound great white that was spotted in November off the coasts of Delaware and Virginia Beach. And there was Miss Costa, a 12 1/2-foot long, 1,700-pound great white that was tracked in October off the coast east of the Virginia-North Carolina border.\nThe information scientists glean once a shark is tagged is important, they said, to understanding more about the creatures and how to preserve their habitat.\nTagging a shark, however, is not easy.\nCrews use a 126-foot boat and a special hydraulic lift to get access to the animal for a brief time. In about 15 minutes, they take blood and genetic samples, and attach a transmitter to the shark’s dorsal fin.\nThat transmitter sends a signal to satellites and works much like a GPS tracker. It allows scientists to follow the shark’s movements. When the shark swims near the surface, which usually isn’t often, the transmitter sends a signal that gets picked up by a satellite. Scientists can then see the shark’s location in near real time, experts said.\nOcearch has tracked about 300 sharks over the past decade. It uses the information to help understand the sharks’ habitats, including where they feed — and when — and where they give birth.\nTypically, the tags placed on a shark last about five years. Experts who follow the sharks with Ocearch have said the material they gather is “critical” for protecting the sharks."},{"url":"https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/05/do-jobs-follow-people-or-do-people-follow-jobs/523296","title":"Do Jobs Follow People or Do People Follow Jobs?","author_text":"Richard Florida","keywords":[],"publication_text":"CityLab","description":"According to a new study pulling numbers from 250 economic regions in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, it all depends on what kind of jobs are created.","date":"","full_text":"It’s the biggest chicken-and-egg dilemma of economic development: Do jobs follow people or do people follow jobs?\nTraditionally, it was thought that people follow jobs. We move for money, right? Accordingly, cities shelled out big incentive packages in order to lure companies and factories. But with the rise of the knowledge economy, the opposite notion has gained sway: Highly skilled and talented people—the knowledge and professional workers, artists, musicians, and media workers that comprise the creative class—have the ability to pick where they want to live and then create and attract companies.\nA new study published in the journal Regional Studies takes a fresh look at this eternal question, examining it in light of the kinds of work people do—knowledge and creative work versus more traditional blue-collar and service jobs. A team of economists led by Stein Østbye of the Arctic University of Norway looked at some 250 economic regions across the Nordic nations of Sweden, Norway, and Finland, examining the degree to which the availability of jobs (or job density) attracts people and vice versa by comparing growth rates of both population and jobs. There are two big takeaways from the study.\nWhen it comes to the entire economy, it seems, people follow jobs, not the other way around. Overall, a higher rate of job density growth results in statistically significant increase in the growth rate for population density, but a higher growth rate of people density does not lead to a statistically significant change in job density. Interestingly, the study finds that both people and jobs are attracted to natural and cultural amenities as measured by the bohemian index (a measure of artistic and cultural workers). Here the study notes that such amenities increase the attraction of places for both people and industries.\nBut when it comes to high-paying knowledge, professional, and creative jobs—the ones that drive the economy and innovation—the opposite is true: Jobs follow people. After isolating and examining creative class workers, the study findings reverse, as the density of skilled work follows the density of skilled people.\nAnd there’s more. Once knowledge-economy jobs are taken out of the picture, the remaining less-skilled main sector jobs no longer attract people (as is the case in their overall model). Here again, even these less-skilled jobs follow people. These two kinds of jobs follow one another, main jobs follow smart jobs and vice-versa, creating a cumulative cycle of economic growth. The two go together and reinforce one another. The study finds that creative class jobs follow a one-way causation with higher education, but also follow a circular causation from other jobs.\nIn other words, the chicken-and-egg dilemma makes little sense when it comes to urban economic development. People attract jobs and jobs attract people. Creative-class jobs attract less-skilled jobs, and vice-versa. The end result is the kind of geographic inequality we see today, where a relatively small share of cities and metros attract a disproportionate share of high-skilled jobs and top talent. In the United States, for example, just five percent of all metros (19 out 364 metros) have dynamic and fully-formed knowledge-based economies, with high concentrations not just of knowledge industries and creative talent but of all key industries and talent, according to a 2015 study.\nHere is where the analysis gets really interesting: What can be causing this dual result where jobs attract people overall, but people attract jobs when the economy is split out into both the smart high-skilled sector and the less-skilled main sector? The reason, according to the study, is the prevalence of high-skilled smart jobs in some locations essentially acts to crowd out and deter less-skilled jobs in those locations.\nThe key factor is the competition for land. Skilled people and skilled jobs are able to outbid other industries and other forms of talent for these key locations, pushing less-skilled people and less-skilled jobs into other locations. As knowledge-based economies grow in these places, less-skilled people and more basic industries are pushed out.\nThis situation is made worse, as a growing chorus of urbanists have argued, by land-use policies that restrict the development in these increasingly valuable locations. This creates exactly the kind of geographic inequality we see today in the United States, the United Kingdom, and across the world. That inequality in a key factor in the populist uprisings that helped produce both the Brexit and the election of Donald Trump.\nThe study suggests that policymakers need to take this seriously. While economic logic leads to the clustering of high-skilled jobs and talent in expensive places, policies that appear to favor these privileged places and classes are bound to trigger backlash. What we need are a new set of urban policies which can mitigate the adverse consequences of geographic inequality, help bolster the fortunes of sagging places and less advantaged groups, and reknit the fraying social compact."},{"url":"https://theconversation.com/how-would-engineers-build-the-golden-gate-bridge-today-77846","title":"How would engineers build the Golden Gate Bridge today?","author_text":"Hota GangaRao","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Conversation","description":"It's been 80 years since this beloved landmark opened to San Francisco traffic. In the interim, technology has advanced – is there a better way to span this strait?","date":"","full_text":"Ever since the Golden Gate Bridge opened to traffic on May 27, 1937, it’s been an iconic symbol on the American landscape.\nBy 1870, people had realized the necessity of building a bridge spanning the Golden Gate Strait to connect the city of San Francisco with Marin County. However, it was another half-century before structural engineer Joseph Strauss submitted his bridge proposal. The plans evolved, and the final project was approved as a suspension bridge that ended up taking over four years to build.\nWhen the Golden Gate Bridge went up, it was the longest suspended bridge span in the world – cables hold up the roadway between two towers, with no intermediate supports. And the setting had a number of inherent challenges. It cost about US$37 million at the time; building the same structure today would cost about a billion dollars. So how has the design held up over the past 80 years – and would we do things differently if we were starting from scratch today?\nLongest suspension bridge in the world\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge, meaning it relies on cables and suspenders under tension along with towers under compression to cross a long distance without any intermediate supports. The roadway deck hangs from vertical suspenders that connect to the two main cables that run between the towers and the anchors on the end. The suspenders transfer vehicular forces and self-weight to the supporting cables that are anchored to towers and on to solid ground.\nThe first bridges of this type probably connected two cliffs with flexible ropes to cross a valley or a river. Hundreds of years ago, these ropes were made of plant fiber; iron chains came later. The Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, opened in 1883, was the first to use steel cables, which then became standard.\nThe towers likely started as a simple rock on each side of a valley; eventually engineers used massive stone or steel piers. The Golden Gate Bridge, for instance, is supported by one abutment on each end and the two towers, which are placed over foundations embedded in the seafloor.\nThe Golden Gate Bridge’s two supporting cables are about the only thing that has not been changed since the bridge was opened to traffic in 1937. Each main cable is formed by 27,572 steel wires with the approximate thickness of a pencil. Construction crews hung nearly 80,000 miles of wire cables from one side of the bridge to the other.\nIt’s nearly impossible to manufacture a long, thick cable in one piece with no flaws to do this job. And crucially, if a single big cable was holding the bridge up and something happened to it, there would be a catastrophic failure. Relying on smaller wires means any failure would be slower, leaving time to divert disaster.\nSince people first started pondering a bridge in the bay of San Francisco, there was huge concern about the structure’s ability to withstand the location’s strong winds, turbulent waters and possible earthquake forces. San Francisco is located at the intersection of two active tectonic plates – obviously no one wanted to see an earthquake bring down the bridge, which currently carries around 112,000 vehicles per day.\nTo avoid this problem, the builders also located shock absorbers at each end of the bridge to absorb the energy coming from wind or seismic forces. These specially designed vibration dampers are meter-diameter cylinders made of a lead core covered by rubber. Placed at strategic locations, they absorb energy that could otherwise cause the bridge to collapse.\nKeeping it in good shape\nConventional wisdom would suggest an infrastructure project is done soon after its inauguration. But keeping the Golden Gate Bridge in tiptop form requires ongoing stringent maintenance. For 80 years, dedicated maintenance crews have serviced the bridge, repainting and substituting the corroded or broken components where necessary.\nThis work must be done to exacting standards. For example, when any of the thousands of bolts that connect all the various pieces of the bridge need replacement, no more than two are taken out simultaneously, to keep the bridge safe against strong winds or earthquakes forces.\nThere are structural maintenance issues, too. Due to the passage of time and ongoing temperature variability, the cables and suspenders elongate or contract, and need periodical checking and retensioning. This type of adjustment is referred to as “tuning” and is similar to how a musician keeps a stringed instrument sounding its best.\nWhat would change if we built it today?\nDue to huge upkeep costs, some people have suggested reconstructing the Golden Gate Bridge in a way that would limit ongoing maintenance and operation bills. Setting aside the political feasibility, how would engineers design the bridge if they were going to build it from scratch today?\nOver time, researchers have developed lighter materials. Using Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRPs) rather than steel or concrete is a way to reduce the weight of a structure of this magnitude. This self-weight is typically responsible for using up 70 to 80 percent of its resistence – that’s the maximum load it can bear before it fails. By reducing it, the bridge’s structure would need less strength, allowing for cheaper and easier options.\nFor example, designers have started using Fiber Reinforced Composite (FRP) materials in bridges such as the Market Street Bridge in West Virginia. FRP uses a plastic resin to bind together glass or carbon fibers, which give strength to the material. Being four times lighter than concrete, the FRPs are five to six times stronger.\nProbably a designer’s first target for change in a substitute Golden Gate Bridge would be the composition of the cables. The steel currently in use is corrosive, heavier by four times than newer materials and can fail in harsh moisture and temperature environments – just like those it encounters in this location. Carbon cables are more inert and already in use around the world.\nThese lighter-than-steel materials could also be utilized in other elements of the bridge, such as the traffic roadway. Using plastic composite decking could bring the Golden Gate Bridge’s deck self-weight down by a factor of five. That would enable engineers to design and construct a cable-stayed bridge rather than a suspension bridge. The advantage there would be the ability to do away with the suspenders; in a cable-stayed bridge forces are transmitted directly from the deck to the towers by the cables. The first highway cable-stayed bridge with CFRP cables is Switzerland’s Stork Bridge, opened in 1996.\nA cable-stayed bridge can have a longer span than a suspension bridge, so its structure between the supports and the shore could be simpler. Also building the towers nearer to the shore, where the waterbed is more shallow, would help alleviate one of the main problems when the Golden Gate Bridge was constructed the first time around: It’s very difficult and expensive to work on the tower foundations in deep water with strong currents.\nThe damping system could also be addressed with a new design. The lead core-based dampers that were used in the construction of the Golden Gate could be replaced by newer technologies that are better able to resist wind, traffic and seismic forces. This improvement would ensure that a failure such as the one on the Tacoma Narrows Bridge – when wind blew the bridge sideways, it twisted and collapsed – would be prevented.\nWith all that said, the Golden Gate Bridge is still doing fine.

Coupled with the findings of the state-commissioned BOTEC Analysis study that came out this year, the work is starting to present an interesting picture of things that can be done to help our youth find a better path to the future.\nI've also been Donna Ladd's driver and valet on a few trips to different parts of the country, where we've seen youth media projects in action—trips that informed the Mississippi Youth Media Project (\"YMP\") this June and July in its own offices in the Capital Towers building overlooking downtown Jackson. Seeing how that project was able to affect teens—from the skyline views to the Google-ish decor to the opportunity to work on digital video, podcasting and web publishing projects—has been enlightening.\nThat included a teenager from a tough background who had negative experiences in juvenile detention, and is now carrying a camera and learning to do publishable illustrations, not to mention market his work.\nIt boils down to something simple, and yet all too often misunderstood or misconstrued. The word I'm looking for is \"opportunity.\" As in, you've got to create some opportunities for young people if you want them to take advantage of them.\nAs you'll see in this week's cover story, Arielle Dreher spent time in Seattle, Wash., this summer to report on programs that offer alternatives to incarceration when young people start to get in trouble, or when they experience violent situations themselves. Counseling, art programs, diversion programs—alternatives that aren't just ankle bracelets, but purposeful efforts to keep minor \"offenders\" out of the criminal-justice system. Proximity to that system, according to the BOTEC report, is one of two primary predictors of future criminal behavior (the other is missing school or dropping out).\nThe cover story tells one part of the solution—how to work with juveniles to keep them out of the system wherever possible. Another part of the solution is to offer not just equal opportunity but equitable opportunity. That means recognizing that underprivileged kids need even more of a boost to take advantage of potential life-changing skills training, both in areas such as digital media arts as well as in \"soft skills\" training that leads to an understanding of the modern workplace and how to successfully negotiate professional life.\nAt SpyHop in Salt Lake City, Utah, Donna and I got a tour of an amazing \"youth digital media center\" facility. With a weekly radio show, film classes, music studio production facilities, digital design and game design—when we saw this place, we knew this was something that Jackson needed. It served as part of the model for the YMP as it now stands and, we hope, grows.\nProjects like these make a concerted effort to reach out to kids who may not have the opportunity otherwise to touch some of this equipment, or collaborate with others as part of a team with a purpose of producing good work. Learning to understand how stories are structured and how the words or photos or video or audio get from concept to final product is an invaluable addition to academic studies. And, for some kids, it's an outlet that gives them a purpose, or a career path, or a diversion from harsh realities or boredom or worse.\nBOTEC also warns that many of the kids who need these opportunities to put them on a different path don't get access to them. They don't hear about them, or companies and providers fear young people who've been in trouble. Our experience, though, is that those young people can be the hungriest, and most grateful, for a chance to learn real, marketable skills. They just need some help connecting with the right training.\nNot every kid needs or wants a digital media education—some prefer vocational training, or speech and leadership training, or athletics or music or fine art. But most kids need something outside of core academics, and, in my opinion, it's incumbent upon the community to provide those things. That's particularly true where communities have been deprived of those programs and resources in the past—that's the equity part.\nI'm reminded how state GOP officials reacted to the Capitol Improvement District in 2016 legislative session. Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves essentially told Jackson that it needs to cut crime in the capital city before the State was willing to allocated more of the city's own tax collections to the city's infrastructure needs—mostly focusing on infrastructure that supports state buildings.\nIt was a cynical gambit and a lame excuse, but it does present a question. If Reeves and other state GOP officials really want to see crime come down in the capital city, are they ready to allocate resources to both academic education, early-education and after-school programs, and to equitably encourage 21st-century extra-curricular programs such as youth digital media projects? How about reform of the youth criminal-justice system so that it no longer helps create worse criminals and expends more tax dollars later?\nThe answer is likely a resounding \"no\"—unless the implementation of those reforms would include a fat ideological payout in the form of some sort of privatization. Failed economic policies and an unwillingness to invest in infrastructure and education in this state seem to benefit some of these leaders individually, while leaving Mississippi on the bottom in terms of economic growth. The only clear solution on that front is to get Mississippi some new leadership.\nBut, in the meantime, we can't wait for gravy-trainers like Reeves and Gov. Phil Bryant to solve much of anything. We know we're on our own in cities like Jackson and in the nonprofit sphere. But that doesn't mean we can't try.\nThe BOTEC reports (paid for by the state, incidentally) point to the notion that only about 225 kids in Jackson are in danger of becoming particularly violent criminals. Many more kids, obviously, will have some encounter with police or \"criminal justice.\"\nHow we shape those systems now—and how we provide alternatives and opportunities that train and build up our young Jacksonians—will have a direct effect on how many fewer of those kids become hardened criminals and how many get the chance to develop an awareness, interest and skill set in more productive pursuits. It will also save innocent lives.\nIn that vein, I want to congratulate our editorial team—Sierra Mannie, Arielle Dreher, Donna Ladd, Tim Summers Jr. and Onelia Hawa—on great work in this space, from in-depth reporting to public events pursuing some of these solutions. Donna Ladd has helmed this action, and we hope you'll keep reading, watching and supporting these efforts.

Last Saturday, Nicole Meyer — Kushner’s sister and a representative of her family’s development company—hosted a meeting for Chinese investors at the Beijing Ritz-Carlton, walking them through how investing enough money in Kushner family properties can open the door to immigration to America.\nIn addition to raising ethical questions and forcing the Kushner family to apologize for appearing to pitch their White House connections, the meeting case a spotlight on the visa she was talking about: The EB-5 visa, which allows foreigners to invest $500,000 to $1 million in the U.S. in exchange for a visa which in turn can lead to what amounts to a green card.\nCritics quickly sharpened their knives for the visa program, saying it gives the wealthy a leg up on moving to the U.S. But for all the uproar over the Kushner family, Washington shouldn’t overreact. The EB-5 program has been a huge success for all involved. Investors have received a coveted U.S. visa, workers have received jobs and companies have found cheap financing. It’s a win-win-win.\nThe headlines play into skepticism that was already mounting in D.C. Last week Congress, extended the EB-5 program until the end of September but its future remains uncertain. Like almost all government programs, EB-5 isn’t perfect. Investments in the U.S. don’t always turn into jobs for American workers; Chinese investors have been known to use the program to simply get their money out of China. These are real problems. But it would be a mistake for Congress to respond to them by ending EB-5 altogether, as critics have suggested. Instead, the program’s 26-year history suggests there are more benefits we aren’t reaping—and that if lawmakers want to improve the program, a better way would be to expand the annual limit on visas tenfold while imposing greater oversight.\nEB-5 was created in 1990 to mimic the job-boosting success of similar programs in other countries like the United Kingdom, Austria and Australia. The investor visa program creates a path to residency for foreign nationals who invest $500,000 to $1 million in U.S. projects that generate at least 10 permanent jobs. The lower $500,000 requirement is for investments in rural projects, or economically depressed areas; otherwise, the required amount is $1 million. Typically, EB-5 investors have backed development of ports, hotels and other commercial properties. The program created 174,000 jobs and generated $5.4 billion in investments in 2012 and 2013, according to the Department of Commerce.\nBut for all its success, EB-5 has garnered harsh pushback among some in Congress. Rural lawmakers correctly point out that most of the projects funded by EB-5 have been in flourishing metropolitan areas; nearly half of all EB-5 investors have invested in new commercial enterprises in California and New York. Some have complained the money really supports wealthy developers and not enough is turned into jobs.\nThese are real problems, but lawmakers shouldn’t respond by eliminating the program. Underlying the visa is a big principle that still holds up: There’s lots of foreign capital that could flow to the U.S., and visas are attractive incentives that don’t cost taxpayers. This may strike people as wrong; aren’t wealthy foreigners jumping the immigration line? But these are immigrants willing to put skin in the American game and make a real down payment on their contribution to the U.S. economy. Those 174,000 jobs the Department of Commerce said came from EB-5 represented 4.3 percent of U.S. job growth during that time – they moved the needle. And EB-5 proved its value during the financial crisis when it was one of the last capital lifelines remaining for parts of the economy.\nCongress needs to fix EB-5 and unleash its potential for creating jobs and drawing investment into rural and urban areas. Here are three ways to improve the program.\nFirst, root out fraud. Principally this has been developers defrauding the immigrant investors. To do so, Congress should require developers receiving funding to provide increased investor security. That means financial audits and standard reporting on projects, streamlined project tracking and investor transparency, a complete audit trail of capital movement and requiring third-party fund administration and validation of capital draw requests. Integrity is a top priority for Congress and the industry can embrace it.\nSecond, expand the entire program. Lawmakers could increase the number of EB-5 visas granted each year from 10,000 to 100,000. Anti-immigrant groups may faint at the idea, but it is difficult to argue this isn’t merit-based immigration. At the investment amounts Congress is considering, such an increase could bring $100 billion in foreign direct investment into the country. Using Department of Commerce data as a starting point, that could project to 1.6 million jobs a year if fully subscribed. If steered properly this volume of investment would also lift rural development and appease critics like Sens. Charles Grassley and Patrick Leahy. In fact, lawmakers could use the expanded EB-5 program to direct as much as $1 trillion to infrastructure projects — a top priority of the Trump administration.\nThird, speed up processing time — and make money doing it. Congress should raise the fees that investors pay the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversees the program, in order to improve processing efficiency and reduce lengthy backlogs. A portion of these fees could also be dedicated to educating governors and mayors throughout the country on how to leverage EB-5 capital in public private partnerships. That would bring investments into the U.S. faster and help direct those funds towards infrastructure projects throughout the country.\nEven before the Kushner controversy cast a shadow on EB-5, the program was already in trouble. Lawmakers extended it in last week’s spending bill, but only until September 30. With negotiations deadlocked, and a fair amount of accumulated distrust in the air, USCIS is poised to implement proposed regulations that would raise the minimum investment to $1.3 million, updating the thresholds for inflation. That may seem reasonable but such a sudden hike would effectively halt new application activity — and the significant investment and job creation that comes with it. If that happens, it would halt a program that has been a powerful engine of job creation, economic growth, productive immigration and infrastructure investment.\nThe Kushner family may continue to reel from the weekend’s misadventures. But used as intended — to spur investment and job creation in the U.S.—the EB-5 program is worth cheers, not jeers, in Washington. Congress should fix its real problems and expand it, leveraging a powerful tool of job creation to benefit more than a million Americans and using the continuing global appeal of America to bring in capital from whoever wants to invest it.\nMichael Halloran is CEO of Silicon Valley fintech company NES Financial."},{"url":"https://www.devex.com/news/disability-inclusion-how-hr-leaders-can-build-more-inclusive-workplaces-90323","title":"Disability inclusion: How HR leaders can build more inclusive workplaces","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Devex","description":"Building a diverse and inclusive workforce requires a work culture where all employees feel fully engaged and able to fulfill their potential.

","date":"2017-06-02","full_text":"Building a diverse and inclusive workforce requires a work culture where all employees feel fully engaged and able to fulfill their potential. Leadership and human resources practices both play critical roles in shaping an organization's work culture, and are therefore key to making employers more inclusive of employees of all diversities and abilities.\nMoney, of course, is always a factor when it comes to hiring decisions, and employers may have concerns about the costs of additional assistance and accommodations for candidates with disabilities. It is harder for development organizations who may work with limited resources and insecure budgets said Ashim Chowla, chief executive of Lepra India, which employs over thirty people affected by leprosy or other diseases to implement its projects in India.*\n“That is not to say that I haven’t see organizations that have cracked it if they wanted to, it comes back to attitude,” he adds.\nHere are just some of the ways positive leadership and HR practices can impact the diversity and inclusion of a workforce.\nSee more related topics:\nLead by example\nLeadership can make the single biggest impact in creating, changing or managing workplace culture. In setting and communicating the organization’s vision, a leader can influence employee behaviors, including attitudes towards hiring and working with people with disabilities. Jessica Pointer, a senior staffing specialist at Tetra Tech, suffers from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and feels strongly that leaders are critical to creating an inclusive work environment. “A message and tone of inclusion need to come from the top,” she says.\n“People inevitably model and mirror that tone and associated behaviors. When leadership makes a value statement of inclusiveness, it’s incumbent on staff to follow suit and make appropriate good faith efforts,” Pointer adds.\nIn the United States, as in most countries, the law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to candidates with disabilities who fit the job requirements. Pointer said however that “individual perspectives don’t always keep pace with legislation,” and so it is up to leadership to establish and reinforce ideas of equality and inclusion. Leaders also influence hiring decisions — they set goals for organizational growth and diversity, they make decisions on resource allocation, and they set criteria for recruitment, selection, training and promotion.\nTake a proactive approach to recruiting diverse talent\nIt is not enough for employers to discuss access issues and install ramps and toilets, they must actually outline and implement inclusive recruitment policies, said Mosharraf Hossain, director of global policy, influencing and research of ADD International. Some organizations have focused on making their office space physically accessible, yet there are still very few people with disabilities actually working there because they didn’t take the time to address inclusion and diversity in their recruitment policy, explains Hossain.\nAnd in order to recruit diverse talent, HR must diversify the way it reaches and attracts candidates. Jennifer Coburn, global staffing specialist with Oxfam America, works with a number of local organizations helping people with different disabilities get into work. Coburn has attended their recruitment events, specifically for people with disabilities, and worked with their employment services to build a diverse pipeline of talent — “they have been invaluable resources,” she said.\nGo the extra mile\nFor most candidates, HR personnel are their first point of contact with an organization. After posting the job and screening candidates, HR coordinates callbacks and typically participates in interviews. Successful candidates will then work with the HR team to negotiate salaries, and discuss start dates, equipment needs and onboarding processes. The people working in HR are therefore an introduction to the organization’s work culture and can make a huge impact on a candidate's first impression of the employer. Small gestures and creative approaches to recruitment can go a long way in demonstrating the organization's commitment to diversity and inclusion. Oxfam’s Coburn, purchased business cards in Braille to allow her to better engage with visually impaired candidates. She says that this sets the expectation for inclusion from the first moment a job seeker interacts with Oxfam.\n“When I hand someone my business card and I watch them realize it is in Braille, you can just see the understanding sweep over their face, they know from that first moment that we take inclusion seriously here,” Coburn added.\nOxfam America has also worked with these different organizations, some of which are state funded, to provide the necessary accommodation and training for new hires to perform at their best. This has included CapTel telephones for deaf or hard-of-hearing employees, working with American Sign Language interpreters, installing Jaws screen reader software and labelling things in Braille to help blind employees, and bringing in mobility experts to help with onboarding.\n“The resources out there for employers are fantastic and the benefits to the organization far outweigh the little bit of extra effort it may take to properly onboard and support staff with different abilities,” Coburn explained.\n* Update, June 14, 2017: This article has been updated to clarify that Ashim Chowla is chief executive of Lepra India.\nOver the next month, Devex, together with our partners the Career Development Roundtable and UNFPA, will take a look at how human resources can be a real driver for innovation, efficiency, and impact in global development.

Children point to images and buttons on her apron to choose a hug, handshake, or a smile. “A high-five?” she asks one child, who leaps to slap her outstretched hand.\nThe scene might be typical of many schools, but Van Ness, which this year offered pre-K through first grade, stands out in the nation’s capital because it is an exception to what Robinson-Rivers calls “an unfortunate trend.” About 84 of Van Ness preschoolers are black, 60 are white, 14 are Hispanic, and the remaining few dozen are of various Asian backgrounds, or listed as multiracial, according to the D.C. Public Schools — making the school one of the District’s most diverse by race, ethnicity and social class. “Schools are becoming less, not more diverse,” Robinson-Rivers said. “The opportunity for a school like this is especially important.”\nThe diversity among the school’s littlest students reflects changes in the school’s neighborhood. Once largely industrial, the Navy Yard area is now home to Nationals Park, restaurants and sparkling new condo buildings – all blocks from well-established low-income apartments just across South Capitol Street.\nWashington has one of the nation’s highest quality preschool programs. It’s also one of the most segregated. In the 2013-14 school year, 86 percent of the city’s black pre-K students attended “racially isolated” nonwhite schools — the highest rate in the nation.\nBut a new generation of parents, including young middle- and upper-class families descending on the city, could herald an end to the city’s entrenched segregation. For the 2016-17 school year, the waiting list for D.C. pre-K classes skyrocketed into the thousands. More than 4,000 preschoolers were on waiting lists in traditional and charter schools.\nRelated: Sixty years after Brown v. Board of education, how segregated are we?\nAlready, gentrification is bringing signs of change: White 3- and 4-year-olds represent 15 percent of pre-K students in D.C. in the current school year, up from 11 percent in 2013-14. The percentage of black and Hispanic students dropped slightly over the same period.\nThere is a long way to go. Most of D.C.’s black pre-K students attended schools where African-American student enrollment was 90 percent or higher, although D.C. school officials point out that the city has one of the nation’s highest concentrations of black residents. Nearly two-thirds of the city’s Hispanic preschoolers also attended racially isolated schools, the nation’s third-highest rate, behind only Texas and California. The national rates were 51 percent for black students and 53 percent for Hispanic students, according to federal data cited in a 2016 study by Penn State University education professor Erica Frankenberg that compared D.C. to states.\nRelated: Will high school segregation for refugees lead to better integration?\nD.C. also has the nation’s highest overall enrollment rate of both 3- and 4-year-olds in pre-K: 84 percent of 4-year-olds and 70 percent of the city’s 3-year-olds attend public preschool, according to the D.C. Office of the State Superintendent of Education, which monitors the programs. Those figures don’t include children who attend private preschools.\nA majority of D.C. pre-K students, nearly 6,700, attend charter schools. More than 5,900 in pre-K attend traditional public schools, and about 600 attend pre-K in community-based child care centers, according to city data confirmed by the D.C. Public Schools and the D.C. Public Charter School Board.\nTo enroll in pre-K classes, D.C. families must enter a lottery. They record their 12 top school choices, and their entries are prioritized based on proximity to each school, whether a child’s sibling is enrolled, and other criteria. All 3- and 4-year-olds are guaranteed a slot, but not necessarily in a nearby school — a challenge for some families. No transportation is provided for any D.C. students, except those with disabilities.\nThat means that a school’s demographics may depend in part on how its neighborhood is changing, as in the case of Van Ness, and whether more parents can take the time to bring their children to school.\nBut diversity is also something more families are looking for as they decide where to live and enroll their children in school. A startup group called Learn Together, Live Together held its kickoff event at the Meridian Pint pub in D.C.’s Columbia Heights neighborhood in early April. A few singles and parents of young children huddled around a pool table, sampled craft beers, and listened to group co-founders Christopher Suarez and Jenna Tomasello riffed on the need for more diverse schools in the nation’s capital.\n“It’s not that this generation doesn’t care,” said Suarez, now a lawyer in private practice in D.C. who currently lives with his wife and 11-month-old son across the Potomac River in Alexandria. “It’s that this generation hasn’t thought about it.”\nVan Ness reopened in 2015, after being shuttered for nine years. It will add a grade each year until it offers pre-K to fifth grade. The current pre-K waiting list is 444 students long, soaring past the school’s enrollment, according to the District of Columbia Public Schools.\nMore typical of the city’s preschools is Cedar Tree Academy public charter school, just two miles away, across the Anacostia River. The school serves about 385 students from pre-K-3 through kindergarten only, and has a waiting list of only two. “There’s not a lot of diversity at our school,” said LaTonya Henderson, Cedar Tree’s executive director.\nAlmost every student is black, although a handful identify as multiracial. One-third of Henderson’s students are homeless, or “doubled up,” staying with family or friends, or even living in cars. Virtually everyone comes from a low-income family, many from the Barry Farm and other nearby public housing projects.\nDespite the challenges facing Cedar Tree and its community, the school rates in Tier 1 for quality, the city’s highest designation. Every class has at least three adults working with students to provide attention. All students take Spanish and music.\nSadiqa Long, the school’s director of counseling and student services, who grew up in nearby Southeast, said the school is thriving. “We really don’t care what you look like. We’re going to treat you kind, and we’re going to teach you well.\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

Sunday morning sales would not happen unless the local city council or county commission approves them.\n• In an unrelated matter, the legislation would loosen regulations on liquor distilleries. The changes are expected to boost their sales.\n• The bill authorizes the sale of alcohol at auctions.\nRestaurant owners have sought the Sunday morning sales to cater to customers who like to have drinks with Sunday breakfast or brunch. They have promoted the legislation with a slogan: “#FreeTheMimosa.”\nSenate Bill 155 would allow alcohol sales as early as 10 a.m. not only at restaurants, but at grocery and convenience stores, bars and other places that now are required to wait until noon.\n“For North Carolina cities and towns where business is driven heavily by tourism, or where local residents demand more choices, this bill offers a positive option that can help restaurants meet customer demands, grow business, create jobs, increase tax revenue and bring patrons into business districts earlier in the day,” said Lynn Minges said in a news release Thursday. She’s the president and CEO of the North Carolina Restaurant \u0026 Lodging Association.\nReligious conservatives oppose the proposal. They say Sunday mornings should be reserved for church.\nChurches minister to people who abuse alcohol, the Rev. Mark Creech of The Christian Action League said at a Senate committee that took up the bill Thursday morning.\n“This legislation is sensitive to business interests, but insensitive to churches and unintentionally undercuts the kind of environment that supports their efforts to have a maximum impact for good,” Creech said. “Surely we can wait to start serving drinks until after the preacher has said the benediction.”\nCreech also spoke against the distillery provisions.\nThe distillery sections would let distillers hold tasting events and allow distillers to sell as many as five bottles per year to people who tour their distilleries; the current limit is one bottle per year.

I’ve always considered myself moderate, pragmatic and not swayed by pure ideology.\nI attended a relatively liberal university where I was routinely disturbed and even disgusted by the statements of some of my “progressive” peers. Those same peers thought I was a neocon because I didn’t vote for the Green Party candidate. I felt like ripping down signs posted around campus that said “Support the insurgency in Fallujah” during the height of the Iraq war. I cringed at the students who gathered around U.S. military recruiters at a job fair and shouted them down any time an interested student approached them.\nI’m the most conservative member of my immediate family. Republican friends generally think I’m a bleeding heart, and many liberal friends think I’m a conservative. I’ve always taken a little bit of pride in the fact that the hard core on both sides of the aisle rejected my political beliefs.\nRecently, I attended a small get-together with family and some people I had never met before. When I was introduced to another partygoer, I was presented by my name, my relationship to the host and as a “left-winger.” I immediately objected to this categorization because I’m not by any definition left wing.\nWhen questioned about the presidential election, I revealed I had voted for Hillary Clinton. I was then asked if I supported Kathy Griffin’s recent ill-advised foray into mock decapitation. I answered a question with a question, and asked whether he supported Richard Spencer and the alt-right movement. We tried to find common ground, and we all got out of the conversation unscathed, but it was a microcosm of the polarization Americans have come to expect out of our country’s new political Weltanschauung.\nThese days, it’s common for us to demonize our political opponents and to define them by the fringes of their parties. We all need to do a better job of condemning those within our ranks who are helping to destroy the American moderate.\nI’ll start by denouncing Kathy Griffin for her tasteless and offensive “joke.” We not only need denounce it, but also avoid the temptation to draw parallels between racist memes spread about President Barack Obama. Pretending to hold a sitting president’s severed head is abhorrent, period.\nBy the same token, supporters of President Donald Trump have to stop responding to criticisms of him by simply stating that Hillary Clinton or Obama were worse. This doesn’t require any critical thought or introspection and serves only to prompt all sides of an argument to retreat into their comfortably entrenched preconceived beliefs.\nI also wholly condemn the students at Evergreen State College in Washington who asked all white students and faculty not to come to the campus for a day, as part of an annual “day of absence” tradition. This doesn’t further the cause of social justice, it’s an act of overt racism.\nSimilarly, there are the students at universities across the country who are protesting and rioting to keep rabble-rousers like Ann Coulter and Richard Spencer from being allowed to speak. It’s important to distinguish protesting their beliefs from those who protest their right to speak those beliefs. The former are as American as apple pie. The latter are enemies of freedom of speech, and just as odious to me as those who vandalized a bumper sticker on my wife’s vehicle in the days after the election, or the person who stole a sign out of our yard that simply expressed support for our neighbors, no matter their background.\nI’m not naive enough to believe that the polarization of American opinion that has been building for decades will change anytime soon. But I do call on the principled among us to put country and reason above party, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican. Condemn the extremists in your own ranks, think critically about your position without just thinking about how evil your opponent is and acknowledge that extremism and ultra-polarization are harmful to the very fabric of our government and society.\nIf some of us can start to build on those ideas, we’ll go a long way toward reviving an important and seemingly forgotten political group: pragmatic moderates.\nDylan Whitehead is an insurance professional in Richardson.

Back then, I thought my freakish flexibility was a superpower.

Reaching the highest levels of Ashtanga yoga was a breeze. But what was once a blessing has become more like a curse.\nDisjointed\nDozens of times in a day, my bones would slip from their sockets - my elbows when I swim, my fingers when I type, my shoulders when I open a door. I almost choked to death on my own voice box last summer when I was swimming backstroke and my larynx ripped out of place.

I chose the latter and eventually managed to walk again.\nBack on my feet, I've taken my act on the road to hospitals in Lebanon, Oman, India, and Mongolia. I'm breaking new ground as a medical mutant in the Middle East and Asia, sharing what it's like to inhabit a body that challenges the authority of medicine and trespasses the conventional boundaries of pain.\nGoing beyond borders\nI have no familial blueprint for managing this illness since my biological mother is an FBI Missing Persons Case having disappeared off a cruise ship in the Caribbean. Despite once being in foster care and a failure-to-thrive baby, I finished five Ivy League degrees and a Postdoctoral Fellowship at Harvard by the age of 30, with the help of disability accommodations. But outside the academy, I have learned that we have barely begun to make this world a safer and more just one for people with disabilities.\nVolunteering with Iraqi, Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian children at the Children's Cancer Centre at St Jude's in Beirut [Photo courtesy of Emily O'Dell]\nLike when I fell face down on a bus while on crutches in New York, because no one would give up a seat. Or got physically assaulted in my wheelchair by an attacker who wrongly assumed I couldn't fight back. Fearing discrimination and the trauma of violence, I don't wear the scaffolding I'm prescribed: hip brace, wrist splint, elbow support, neck collar. But being invisibly disabled comes with risks and difficulties of its own.\nMy deficient connective tissue has compelled me to connect with others around the globe fighting for disability justice too. I've conducted disability workshops and mental health awareness events in Beirut and Muscat. I've forged friendships with activists like Laila Atshan, a blind Palestinian Harvard-educated therapist treating trauma survivors from various warzones, and spoken about disability rights with heads of state like the Dragon King of Bhutan.\nThis winter I travelled to Bangalore to speak at the Ehlers-Danlos Society's conference in India and to learn from the top global experts in the field.

Children with cancer at St Jude's in Beirut, Syrians in refugee camps, and Sudanese refugees from Darfur. Lacking the proper connective tissue to join my bones, I have manufactured an alternative glue - a heart that yearns to connect in social solidarity with others suffering too.\nRecently, after giving a workshop to the physical therapy department at Sultan Qaboos Hospital in Oman, one bewildered therapist asked: \"So, how do you live?\"\nI live now in awe of what the body can do, and amazed by how a soul can soldier on despite the body being so broken. Instead of merely being fixated on learning the grammar of languages like Mongolian and Kumzari, I'm now just as fascinated by the vocal cords that allow me to speak them. Knowing that I could one day go blind, I've become grateful for the sense of sight. No longer dependent on my wheelchair, I'm cognisant of the miracle of each step. My sense of consciousness has been expanded by what I can't do. My sense of responsibility has been expanded by what I can.\nThese days, I can't help but see my own brokenness and the brokenness of the world as one. Each one of us is vulnerable to becoming - at any given moment - disabled. We are all incurable, hurtling side-by-side to our inevitable end.

Trump wants to tackle tax reform, but the loss on health care deals a blow to that effort. The loss on health care deprives Republicans of $1 trillion in tax cuts, and the GOP is just as divided on what steps to take.\nRepublican lawmakers were expected to use the momentum from repealing and replacing Obamacare to propel them to success passing comprehensive tax reform. Now it appears both are much more difficult than originally calculated.\nTax reform, in particular, is bogged down in the muddy waters of special interests. But that is because the focus is misdirected. Balancing the budget, not picking winners and losers, should be the overriding goal.\nRepublican plans have long favored eliminating most, if not all, tax exemptions and loopholes, which would generate enough income to allow them to reduce tax rates for all.\nBut as Seattle University tax law professor Lily Kahng told The Wall Street Journal, “Once you extend some kind of tax preference to people, it becomes almost like an entitlement and people are really protective of it.”\nThat applies to mortgage interest deductions, tax breaks for retirement plans, various deductions for businesses and a host of other things.\nReports out of Washington indicate lawmakers are having trouble finding enough ways to pare loopholes to cover the cost of lower tax rates. They may have found consensus for eliminating deductions for state and local taxes, but Republican lawmakers from traditionally Democratic districts may not go along.\nDisagreements also exist around the so-called border adjustment tax, which would impose a 20 percent tariff on imports that would not apply to exports.\nRepublicans are on the right track on broadening the tax base by reducing deductions and then lowering all tax rates. This would especially be helpful on the corporate income tax rate.\nHowever, the border adjustment tax would be a disastrous measure. It would lead to increases in the cost of goods American consumers purchase, and it likely would lead to a trade war as other nations impose similar taxes on American exports.\nAmong the worst ideas under consideration is a plan to make tax cuts temporary. This would allow Republican senators to bypass an important and sensible procedural rule requiring any cuts to be revenue neutral within the budget window if lawmakers wish to circumvent filibusters from political opponents. One suggestion is to increase the budget window from its normal 10-year period to as many as 30 years — making temporary cuts virtually permanent for the current generation and sending budget deficits into orbit.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done\nLawmakers from both parties want to operate under the false notion that budget deficits and the national debt don’t matter. They do, and as they continue a steady upward course, a day of reckoning looms on the horizon.\nEarlier this year, the Committee for a Responsible Budget estimated the president’s proposed tax cuts would raise the national debt from its current level of 77 percent of gross domestic product to 111 percent by 2027.\nAt some point, the holders of U.S. debt will demand higher interest rates as their confidence wanes in the nation’s ability to pay. Such a loss of confidence would lead to even higher debt burdens, inflation, unemployment and the dollar losing its status as the world’s leading currency. The nation’s military no longer would have the resources available to fight wars. Businesses no longer could access easy credit.\nPuerto Rico’s current economic crisis offers a small example of conditions that would confront the entire nation.\nPolitical courage is needed today to avoid such a scene. Lawmakers should be obsessed with balancing the budget, understanding that a little political pain today would pay off in many positive ways tomorrow."},{"url":"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/students-stutter-doesnt-stop-winning-crowd","title":"A student’s stutter doesn’t stop him from winning over the crowd","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"PBS NewsHour","description":"Trevor Acord hasn’t let a stutter stop him from being a leader and role model at his school.

We may sometimes see unusual facial movements or body movements that are associated with stuttering.\nAccording to the Stuttering Foundation, there are about three million Americans who stutter, which is about 1 percent of the general population, and it is more common in males than females.\nTREVOR ACORD, Communications Arts High School: Some of the downsides of having a stutter, though, for me is that, sometimes, it just makes it really hard to speak and to just really put yourself — and hard to just really sort of put yourself out there, because you’re afraid of what others will think.\nBut, with me, I love to speak, and I just love talking with all these people. So, I guess it seems sort of ironic that someone with a stutter would be going to a communications school.\nSHELLIE MALIK, Teacher, Communications Arts High School: I think part of Trevor’s success has come because he is so comfortable with everybody here.

They have until Sept. 30 to apply. ","date":"2017-06-06","full_text":"Each year, thousands of Americans miss their deadline to enroll in Medicare, and federal officials and consumer advocates worry that many of them mistakenly think they don’t need to sign up because they have purchased insurance on the health law’s marketplaces. That decision can leave them facing a lifetime of enrollment penalties.\nNow Medicare has temporarily changed its rules to offer a reprieve from penalties for people who kept Affordable Care Act policies after becoming eligible for Medicare.\n“Many of these individuals did not receive the information necessary [when they became eligible for Medicare or when they initially enrolled] in coverage through the marketplace to make an informed decision regarding” Medicare enrollment, said a Medicare spokesman, explaining the policy change.\nThose who qualify include people 65 and older who have a marketplace plan or had one they lost or canceled, as well as people who have qualified for Medicare due to a disability but chose to use marketplace plans.\nThey have until Sept. 30 to request a waiver of the usual penalty Medicare assesses when people delay signing up for Medicare’s Part B, which covers visits to the doctor and other outpatient care. Medicare beneficiaries who already pay the penalty because they had a marketplace plan can request that it be eliminated or reduced.\nMedicare also imposes a waiting period for coverage on people who do not sign up when first eligible. If they meet the waiver requirements, they now can request that be lifted.\n“This has been a problem from the beginning of the Affordable Care Act, because the government didn’t understand that people would not know when they needed to sign up for Medicare,” said Bonnie Burns, a consultant for California Health Advocates, a consumer group. “Once they had insurance, that relieved all the stress of not having coverage and then when they became eligible for Medicare, nobody told them to make that change.”\nOne of them is Lisa Grimes’ 49-year-old sister, who receives Social Security disability benefits because of mental illness. She became eligible for Medicare because she receives those disability benefits but had marketplace coverage at that time.\nFor the past year, Grimes, a St. Louis real estate lawyer, has been trying to unravel the problems that ensued after her sister opted to keep her marketplace plan and drop her Part B coverage, probably because her marketplace premium at the time cost half as much. Only after that $50 monthly premium ballooned to $360 did they learn that marketplace customers lose their premium subsidies when they join Medicare. (Grimes agreed to be interviewed as long as her sister was not identified.)\nOther Medicare beneficiaries have made similar mistakes by assuming they didn’t need Part B if they had a marketplace plan, retiree coverage from a former employer or coverage through a current employer with fewer than 20 workers or with the Department of Veterans Affairs. None of these is a substitute for Medicare Part B.\nGrimes said her sister couldn’t afford the new marketplace premium and had to drop her plan last year. The Social Security Administration denied her appeal to reinstate her Part B coverage with no penalty or wait period. Then she learned about the new Medicare waiver from a Missouri counselor at the State Health Insurance Assistance Program.\nIt took several hours for Grimes to find the right letters and other documents needed to apply since her sister’s “filing system was a large shopping bag,” Grimes said. With assistance from the Medicare Rights Center, her sister received Part B coverage without a late fee or waiting period. It was retroactive, so she might be reimbursed for the medical bills she paid last fall and winter when she had no insurance coverage for doctor visits.\nPeople need to sign up for Part B usually within three months before or after turning 65 if they aren’t getting job-based insurance, or when their job-based health insurance ends if they are older than 65, according to Medicare rules. Most people under 65 who receive Social Security disability benefits qualify for Part B after 24 months of benefits.\nUnder the health law, people who qualify for Medicare will lose subsidies in the online exchange plans. And enrolling in one of those plans does not protect them from a permanent late enrollment penalty.\nMarketplace insurers, who are often the first to spot when a member is turning 65, are barred under the health law from canceling coverage because that member may qualify for Medicare, Burns said. They are required, however, to cancel a Medicare-eligible member’s subsidies.\nLast summer, Medicare officials began sending emails each month to about 15,000 people with subsidized coverage through the federally run marketplace. The notices target people approaching their 65th birthday and tell them how “to avoid an unwanted overlap in Marketplace and Medicare coverage.” Officials also began contacting individuals who already have both Medicare and subsidized marketplace coverage, urging them to discontinue the latter.\nYet the warnings have missed some people with marketplace coverage, who could find themselves on the hook to cover their own medical bills if their private insurer indicates they should have been on Medicare and refuses to pay.\n“These are very complex rules,” said Stacy Sanders, federal policy director at the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer advocacy group that spearheaded an effort in 2015 by nearly 50 unions, insurance companies and seniors’ advocacy organizations urging Medicare officials to address the problem. “The lack of good notification was leading people down a dangerous path in terms of declining or delaying Part B.”\nThose who enroll in Part B 12 months or later after becoming eligible can face a permanent penalty of 10 percent added to the Part B premium for each full 12-month period that a beneficiary could have had Part B, but didn’t enroll. This year, the Part B standard average monthly premium is $109.\nMedicare began emailing letters in March about the temporary waiver to some people 65 and older who are enrolled in plans sold on the marketplaces run by the federal government. But the federal government is not reaching out to others who may be eligible.\nCalifornia, with the largest state-run marketplace — serving 1.4 million consumers — is planning a similar information campaign. So are some other states that run their own marketplaces, including Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York.\nFor information on how to apply for the waiver, officially called “time-limited equitable relief,” go to the Medicare Rights Center’s Medicare Interactive webpage or call the center’s helpline at 800-333-4114.\nKHN’s coverage related to aging \u0026 improving care of older adults is supported by The John A.

David Craig (R-Town of Vernon) and Rep. Mary Felzkowski (R-Irma) in March, the bill, Senate Bill 169, also enables people to carry concealed firearms without a permit. The legislation would undo current state law, which mandates that concealed firearm carriers get training and a license.\nThe Senate's Judiciary and Public Safety Committee will hear public testimony on the bill Wednesday in Madison.\nLast week, the Mequon-Thiensville district’s Board of Education passed a resolution denouncing the bill, which it claims would weaken the state’s gun control laws.\nThe district joins several North Shore districts, including Shorewood and\nFox Point-Bayside, that have spoken out in recent months on the legislation.\n“We have concerns that it’s going to make school safety more difficult to implement,” Mequon-Thiensville Superintendent Demond Means said.\nThe resolution declares firearm-related violence in the nation “a persistent societal ill that results in approximately 100,000 victims annually,” citing 222 school shootings in the United States since 2013.\nUnder the bill, schools would have to individually post signs prohibiting weapons under state trespassing laws in order to ban them from the grounds. Though illegal possession of a weapon in a school is currently a felony under state law, a violation of the trespassing provision in a school building is a class C misdemeanor.\n“The strong stance we have taken has been overwhelmingly supported by parents in our community,” said Jon Jacobs, the Mequon-Thiensville board’s legislative committee chairman, in a statement.\nSupporters of the bill maintain that the school grounds provision ensures parents who carry guns do not accidentally break the law when picking children up. The bill would allow those with a concealed carry permit to have a gun in their vehicle while taking children to or from school even if a school has posted notices.\nNik Clark, chairman of the gun rights group Wisconsin Carry, said current state law creates “landmines around citizens’ constitutional right to carry.”\nThe bill, Clark stressed, will instead ensure that parents are not punished when taking kids to and from school while carrying a gun — something many don’t even know is currently a felony, Clark said.\nAnd not all districts are as concerned with the ramifications of the bill.\nTom David, president of the New Berlin School Board, said the board supports the bill. If it passes, districts that opposed it can simply post signs banning guns.\n“It’s all about local control,” he said.\nDavid pointed to other states that allow concealed weapons in schools. These include Arizona, New Hampshire and Utah. “There’s never been an issue,” he said.\n“You’re just going to get a lot of doom and gloom,” David said of those concerned the bill would threaten students’ safety. “I’ve heard it all.”\nConcern over reducing the penalty for illegally possessing a gun in school zones is moot, Clark added, because “anybody with criminal intent is going to commit a much more serious crime.”\nDan Rossmiller, a lobbyist for the Wisconsin Association of School Boards, said the bill would require schools to look seriously at the need to post notices if they want to keep guns out of their buildings and off their grounds.\n“To a certain extent the people behind the effort to change the law have made a good faith effort to try to address some concerns,” Rossmiller said. “I'm bound by my membership's position expressed in the resolution, so I'm not in support and my association is not in support of the legislation. But I understand the balancing that they're trying to do.”\nIn 2016, a similar bill was proposed that would have allowed concealed weapon permit holders to bring guns onto school grounds and into some buildings."},{"url":"http://www.hcn.org/articles/what-citizen-science-can-tell-us-about-the-deaths-of-seabirds","title":"What citizen science can say about seabird deaths","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"In the Pacific Northwest, the diligence of citizen scientists helps discern patterns in die-offs.","date":"","full_text":"This article is from Hakai Magazine, an online publication about science and society in coastal ecosystems.

Where the trail turns muddy, we find a drier alternate route above a border of sword ferns and take special care crossing the slippery boardwalks and prostrate logs. The late-morning sun filters through the canopy, melting some patches of ice and leaving others to crunch under our boots. The forest answers back with the trilling staccato of a tiny Pacific wren.\nByrnes is a former fisheries technician with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who lives with his partner, Sue Nattinger, in the nearby rural community of Joyce on the Olympic Peninsula. Their 2.2-hectare property even came with two coho salmon streams. “That’s why I bought it,” he says. “I didn’t even look at the house.”\nHe is unhurried and deliberate on the trail, seizing the opportunity to chat about everything from climate change to the U.S. presidency to the state of journalism. “If you were on a deserted island and wanted to be mentally stimulated, you’d want Coleman with you,” remarks his friend Bob Phreaner, a retired Philadelphia dentist who moved to the Olympic Peninsula for the biodiversity and temperate climate.\nNattinger is a medical lab technician and accomplished hiker who first climbed 2,429-meter Mount Olympus at age 17 — and returned 11 years later with her 10-week-old child in a front carrier. She walks mostly in silence, wearing a cochlear implant due to a hearing impairment. I speak loudly and deliberately. “I’m able to identify some birds by their songs or calls, as long as they’re close or loud enough for me to hear,” she says. “I compensate some by being more attentive to visual cues.”\nAfter close to an hour, we reach gothic stands of Sitka spruce and begin a 60-meter scramble down to the Pacific Ocean, securing our feet against the exposed roots and grabbing ropes to arrest our descent. “It hurts my knees coming back up,” confides Byrnes, staring down the precipice. “That’s what will stop me from doing this.”\nAt trail’s end, we punch through the understory of salal, an evergreen shrub that grows thick on the coast. Marine buoys hanging from tree limbs mark the entrance to Shi Shi Beach, a magnificent arc of shoreline pounded by the incessant surf. The cliffs of Cape Flattery are just around the corner to the north, the most northwesterly point in the contiguous United States and home to the Makah Tribe. A monolithic line of rocks known as Point of Arches — a National Natural Landmark and more than twice as old as the nearby Olympic Mountains — forms the southern bookend.\nYou could not ask for a more life-affirming place in the Pacific Northwest — yet death is what brings us here on this crisp winter day.\nByrnes, Nattinger, and Phreaner are among about 800 participants who conduct coastal beach patrols for seabird carcasses from Mendocino County in Northern California through Oregon and Washington (bypassing British Columbia, which has its own beached-bird program, but shares data and employs the same methods), all the way to the Bering Sea in Alaska. Since its creation in 2000, the Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team (COASST) has documented more than 60,000 carcasses representing 180 species on almost 450 beaches. This sort of baseline information helps researchers track long-term trends influenced by human or natural causes, and is critical for comparison against the number of birds by species associated with, say, a natural die-off, an El Niño climate event, or an oil spill. That’s exactly why Phreaner enlisted as a volunteer: He’s worried about the increased movements of petroleum products through the Salish Sea. “Accidents happen,” he says. “I’m concerned about the consequences of oil spills.”\nAs we proceed down the beach, Byrnes allows that he is coming down with a cold and didn’t bring enough warm clothing. He wears a wool sweater and a colorful chili pepper-themed hat, and drapes a pair of Pentax binoculars around his neck. I loan him a fleece sweater on which I had spilled some leftover Riesling while packing up this morning. Today, the brace of ocean spray has competition. “Every once in a while I get a sniff of wine,” he says deadpan. “Not bad.”\nByrnes and Nattinger normally bring along their two dogs to help sniff out the deceased at two other COASST locations — Twin River and Shipwreck Point—but national park rules prohibit pets on Shi Shi Beach. We walk southward near the high tideline, eyes scanning like radar for evidence of unmoving beaks and wings. A creamy layer of sea foam catches us off guard. I scramble onto a clump of rocks pitted by boring clams, while Byrnes gets his feet wet. “Oh jeez, he doesn’t watch the surf,” Nattinger remarks. “Too busy looking for birds.”\nShe strikes out ahead of us and makes the first discovery — a glaucous-winged gull wedged between the drift logs. “No breast or head,” Byrnes observes. “Probably an eagle kill, everything’s eaten.” Phreaner confirms: “That’s pretty clean. Nothing there for the invertebrates to eat.”\nThe gull carcass is photographed and assigned a color-coded tag so it won’t be counted twice by other COASST volunteers, then left on the beach to be scavenged by everything from bears to sand fleas. After all, dead birds are very much a part of the ecosystem.\nToday’s small, dedicated team is the grassroots component of a program founded in academia, at the University of Washington in Seattle. Julia Parrish is a professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences and got the idea for COASST while researching seabirds on Tatoosh Island off Cape Flattery. As she watched common murres and other newly fledged chicks float ashore dead, she wondered if the same thing was also happening on the mainland and elsewhere along the coast. The problem: researchers alone lacked the numbers to cover such vast stretches of coastline. The solution: enlist an army of volunteers, provide them with five hours of basic training in documenting, identifying, and photographing birds according to protocol, then turn them loose.\nParrish observes that casual beachgoers often blame humanity for seabirds washing ashore. Trained volunteers come to learn that while oil spills and fisheries do kill, natural causes such as bad weather, post-breeding mortality, migration fatigue, algal blooms, and lack of food are far deadlier. Birders with vast experience are less naive. “All death and change is not traceable to some person doing something nefarious,” Parrish says. “It’s easy to document that 50 to 75 percent of birds that we see dead on the beach worldwide die of natural causes. It’s just the cycle of life. It’s always been that way.”\nShe boils the seabird deaths down to three patterns of change: cyclical (or seasonal), including anticipated post-breeding mortality and winter kills; catastrophic, such as short-term increases in ocean temperatures resulting in shifts in prey availability and large-scale mortalities; and chronic, a subtle shift that can be hard to measure, but includes pervasive influences such as climate change. “The three Cs together create what we see at any one time,” she says. “The fun mystery … is to tease apart how much of what you experience at any one instantaneous moment is due to each of those overlapping kinds of forces.”\nDuring 17 years as a COASST volunteer conducting monthly patrols on Shi Shi Beach, Byrnes has discovered that the largest bird mortalities start in late August and continue through December, a period when young birds are leaving their nests and coping with winter weather. “They’re learning and a lot of them get weeded out,” he says, adding that in late spring and summer there are hardly any deaths. The birds overwintering off Shi Shi Beach, such as loons and scoters, are migrants from nesting grounds in Alaska and Canada in search of prey and open water. Come spring, they migrate north again.\nSome days, volunteers get skunked during their beach patrols — which, for the record, is a good thing. Other times, birds come ashore in shocking numbers. On December 28, 2014, for instance, Byrnes and his crew recorded 184 dead Cassin’s auklets, stubby gray burrow-nesting seabirds, on Shi Shi Beach. “We ran out of tags and time and started photographing them in large batches,” he recalls. The event was part of a larger-scale auklet die-off extending south to Oregon and north to Vancouver Island attributed to the sudden unavailability of krill and a particularly nutritious species of copepod, both small crustaceans.\nOnly once has Byrnes discovered an oiled bird on Shi Shi Beach, the suspected victim of a fishing boat pumping its bilge water. There are fears that could change for the worse. Controversial projects such as Kinder Morgan’s pipeline expansion in Burrard Inlet near Vancouver are expected to increase oil tanker traffic sevenfold in the international waters of the Salish Sea and heighten concerns for seabirds despite double hulls and tug escorts. It all underscores the need for COASST’s vigilance. “As traffic increases, will we see increased volumes of oil birds?” asks Parrish, noting a spill is inevitable.\nA short distance down the beach, Nattinger waves at us excitedly. Could this be more than the tattered remains of an ordinary gull? We hurry along with high expectations and find her using a piece of wood to pry up a larger log hiding a prized seabird. It is an adult Laysan albatross. “You’re lucky,” Byrnes says to me. “This is a really rare find.”\nNattinger spreads the bird out on the sand for better inspection. “My goodness, look at those honkin’ wings,” she says. The Laysan is a long-lived bird that roams the Pacific on a wingspan of about two meters. One female — Wisdom — banded in 1956 at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge northwest of Hawaii is considered the world’s oldest documented wild bird at a minimum age of 66. She gave birth in February to the latest of the estimated 30 to 35 chicks she’s raised over six decades. The species is rated near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and is found on Shi Shi only once every few years.\nFor times like this, COASST volunteers carry a special sturdy, water-resistant field guide, Beached Birds, which offers tips on identification and measurement, as well as practical advice such as tying back one’s long hair to prevent contact with a potentially diseased carcass. Photos are sent to COASST for official species verification.\nThe team follows protocol by using calipers to measure the bill, the wing cord (the distance from wrist to longest feather tip), and the tarsus (lower leg bone). The badly decomposed carcass is fragile, barely holding together, and the conversation gets tense between Nattinger and Byrnes during one measurement. “You’re not even up to the end,” she admonishes. “I am at the end!” he insists.\nWhen it’s time to move on, I confidently take the lead in hopes of finding something first — only to walk right past the gray feathers of a northern fulmar camouflaged in beach grass near Point of Arches. Tags on the carcass denote it was first recorded November 29, 2016, at about the same location. That makes it an unusual find, since birds tend to get recycled quickly. “When you’re in Alaska, thousands of these follow the fishing boats,” Byrnes says. The gull-like bird is not always a mooch, having the capability of plunging an impressive several meters below the surface for squid, fish, and crustaceans. Admire at a distance: both nesting adults and young can spit a foul-smelling oil at intruders.\nIt is now late afternoon and time to retrace our steps. Byrnes has visited Shi Shi Beach close to 250 times, and remains as awed today as the first time he visited 52 years ago. The place is bustling in summer, having been featured in magazines around the world. Today, it attracts only a smattering of visitors, including an ambitious couple of surfers who have lugged their boards and backpacks through the forest. “Twilight on the beach on a winter day,” Byrnes says with a final glance. “I just love it.”\nNattinger and Phreaner scale the bluff first and continue ahead to the trailhead parking lot in the growing darkness. I stay back with the slower-moving Byrnes — a man who was given his first cellphone only recently, who still doesn’t own a credit card, and who, today at least, carries a flashlight that emits the beam of a firefly. I give him my spare and together we navigate the forested obstacle course.\nByrnes lives by the motto, “Any day indoors is a day wasted,” and embraces his volunteer role. “I like the science and contributing to big data sets. If a lot of animals are going to be saved, you’ll have to know what’s going on,” he says. He also pays a price for dedication: the sheer hours, the body aches, the vehicle expenses, and, who would have guessed, the need to offset one’s carbon footprint. “I pay at least $10 every trip to a group that plants trees,” he says.\nIt’s that kind of commitment that makes the information collected by COASST volunteers so valuable. “These are the people on the ground that know their beaches far better than I do,” Parrish says. “What we all do together is citizen science. It’s a strongly linked team sport, everyone with different roles.”\nThe beach observations are the foundation for a program destined to benefit bird populations over the generations, providing reliable information against which scientists can detect future population changes, some attributed to factors we cannot yet imagine.\nUltimately, the data will outlive the data collectors. “It will be a shame the day I have to stop coming here,” Byrnes says. “You have to know your limitations as you grow older.”\nAs we press on, the rainforest absorbs the last faint sounds of the distant surf. Somewhere out there in the cold darkness on an unsympathetic sea a bird is dying, its carcass to be washed ashore and given new meaning by those who quietly observe and report.\nThis article first appeared in Hakai Magazine, and is republished with permission."},{"url":"http://buffalonews.com/2017/06/02/jamestown-man-charged-drug-possession-amherst-traffic-stop","title":"Jamestown man charged with drug possession during Amherst traffic stop - The Buffalo News","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Buffalo News","description":"Kevin J.

But it’s an open secret in fashion that the big luxury houses are no longer truly in the clothes business.\nTheir moneymakers these days are fragrances, handbags, shoes, and accessories. Indeed, new research suggests, for the Pradas and Louis Vuittons of the world, too much dependence on clothes can actually be a liability.\nIn the modern luxury market, the report by Exane BNP Paribas and the fashion consultancy VR Fashion Luxury Expertise says, clothing may be a “brand-defining core category”—but it is “hardly profitable.” This category, known as ready-to-wear (RTW), refers to the clothes you buy off the rack at stores and online, and the report’s authors note that most brands lose money on it.\nThat’s right: For many fashion brands, fashion is a loss leader. And it’s one that offers less and less benefit proportional to its cost to produce, the report suggests, especially as shoppers can easily find variations of the same trendy styles across the price spectrum, including knockoffs at cheap fast-fashion chains.\n“We consider high exposure to RTW as a structural weakness,” the report states, noting that clothing doesn’t have the same “recognition factor” as accessories, such as the new “it” bag or shoe of the moment. Insofar as customers are buying these brands as a way to communicate status, clothes are simply less effective—which also makes their high prices hard for consumers to justify.\nFor the brands themselves, producing clothes is costly, as is staging runway shows. Meanwhile, it’s getting harder to convince consumers to pay full price, and displaying a collection properly in a physical store requires a lot of space, at a time when brick-and-mortar retail is in flux. As a result, sales of clothes are low and operating margins vanishingly thin.\nThe CEO of Vetements, Guram Gvasalia, made this point recently when explaining why the popular French label nixed its Paris Fashion Week runway show.\n“Today shows have nothing to do with clothes anymore,” he told WWD (paywall). “Most of the looks are not even produced and therefore never get to the shop floor. Shows are there merely to sell a dream that at the end of the day will sell a perfume or a wallet in a duty-free store.”\nNot every brand operates on these terms. Like Vetements, independent designers Rick Owens and Dries Van Noten are known for making their money by actually selling clothes. That’s no easy feat. Unlike large luxury houses where designers have the freedom to design mainly for show, they have to produce collections that people will actually wear, at prices they’re willing to pay. Small designer labels go out of business all the time because they fail to hit this sweet spot.\nThe major European luxury groups smartly limit their exposure to the vagaries of the apparel industry. At Kering, Prada, and Hermès, clothes are only about 10% of the business. Instead, most sales come from bags and other items. “High-end fashion was once a ‘real’ business,” the report says. “The goal was to produce beautiful garments that real people would wear. This is rarely the case today.”\nSo why do most luxury brands continue making expensive clothes? Fashion executives don’t often address the point openly, but Tom Murry, the former CEO of Calvin Klein, offered an explanation in a 2011 interview. For a company that makes its money off underwear, jeans, and perfume, he told Business of Fashion, there’s still a real value to a runway line like CK’s Calvin Klein Collection:\nWell it’s not a business that contributes to the bottom line and it probably never will be. For us, it’s a marketing expense and we generate an incredible amount of editorial that is based on being in that business. The PR department creates over $400 million a year in equivalent editorial, which is massive and which we believe has a very significant impact on our brand image globally.\nWe have reached out to Calvin Klein for comment, since Murry retired from his longtime role in 2014, and Calvin Klein is now working to reinvigorate its runway lines under creative director Raf Simons. We will update this post with any reply.\nBut Murry’s point was echoed in the new report. “The value of maintaining a RTW business is in the aura it creates for the brand,” it explained, emphasizing that the goal of all those expensive clothes, in most cases, is just “not to lose too much money.”"},{"url":"https://thedevelopmentset.com/four-terminally-ill-patients-walk-into-a-bar-2d5023e332bd","title":"Four Terminally Ill Patients Walk Into A Bar… – The Development Set","author_text":"Priti Salian","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Development Set","description":"A crowd of physicians was cracking up watching a bunch of oldies perform standup comedy at Mumbai’s Cuckoo Club.

A new campaign aims to do away with the stigma — by teaching patients to joke about it.\nA crowd of physicians was cracking up watching a bunch of oldies perform standup comedy at Mumbai’s Cuckoo Club. To her attentive audience, Janice Powell couldn’t help pointing out that it was her first standup performance, and, well, could also be her last.\n“Death is not such a bad thing,” she quipped. “Even I have never died, I’m just saying,” she added matter-of-factly, sending her audience into peals of laughter. Powell is a 65-year-old homemaker who has terminal blood cancer. To improve the quality of her life, she is taking palliative care, a holistic treatment that helps her mitigate her suffering physically, psychosocially, and spiritually.\nPooran Issarsingh is one of the first female lawyers in India. She practiced law until the age of 82. These days, she likes to wear make-up and take selfies. “Who knows, one of them might work for my obituary,” she joked with her audience at the club. The octogenarian’s heart pumps at 20% its capacity, but she doesn’t give two hoots about driving around alone in the congested streets of Mumbai.\nDeath and humor may be strange bedfellows. But not for Powell, Issarsingh, and two other terminally ill patients who are rooting for palliative care through the Laugh At Death campaign. The foursome have done a live show, a spot for a radio program, and appeared on national television for this campaign, which premiered on Twitter and YouTube on March 30.\nThe campaign, which is the brainchild of the Indian Association of Palliative Care (IAPC), aims to do away with some of the ignorance about palliative care and the anathema around death.\nThey, and the terminally ill patients who braved the comedy stage, have a special message for viewers: palliative care helps patients get comfortable with death. So comfortable, in fact, that they may even joke about it.\n“In India, death is such a taboo subject that everyone, including the doctors, wants to push it under the carpet,” said Dr. Mary Ann Muckaden, IAPC’s president. India was ranked 67 out of the 80 countries on the Quality of Death Index in a 2015 study commissioned by The Economist. Even though a national policy on palliative care was introduced in 2013, only three Indian states have adopted it.\nMuckaden explained that in India, families and doctors often collude to hide the patients’ illness from them. Apart from their own discomfort having conversations about impending death, they believe it may influence the patient to give up on life.\nFamilies also have an urge to provide the best medical interventions for their sick elders until their last day. Therefore, many patients spend their last days in hospitals without their families, with tubes sticking out of them, sometimes dying in their absence.\nBut studies show that the bulk of the people around the world would prefer to die at home.\nThat’s where palliative care can help. It allows patients a pain-free and dignified end, without having to spend their last days in a hospital amidst a host of medical interventions. Palliative care physicians understand that death is a natural process and instead focus on the quality of life of a dying patient.\n“Patients need to be put on the trajectory of palliative care along with their medical treatment, so when they actually reach the end of life, they are already prepared,” said Muckaden. “They receive psychological counseling, awareness of [their] limited prognosis, and time to accept all of this.” Most importantly, their families are counseled about the importance of the patient making independent treatment choices.\nAs part of the Laugh At Death campaign, a website was launched for physicians, patients, and families to find relevant information on palliative care. A national helpline is in the works to facilitate direct interaction with counselors.\nIAPC partner, an advertising agency called Medulla Communications, conceptualized the idea for the campaign. “We thought it would be inspirational to see someone so close to death be able to joke about it,” said Praful Akali, the agency’s founder. They scouted for terminally ill patients who were aware of palliative care and could speak openly and laugh at their own prognosis.\nAkali found Issarsingh through his personal network and was wowed by her vivacity and positive attitude toward life, despite her life-limiting illness.\n“The best thing about Pooran Didi is that she is super likeable, which helps her make a connection with her audience,” said Kashyap Swaroop, a standup comedian who helped Issarsingh with her set (he refers to her with the Hindi honorific “Didi,” or older sister). She easily shared anecdotes from her life, making it simple for Swaroop and his colleague Vinay Sharma to help structure them into jokes.\nFor Issarsingh, whose conversations are naturally interspersed with laughter, the process was easy. “We created jokes over a few hours of friendly chats,” she said. “They ensured that my feelings come through in all of them.” Her ability to laugh at her limitations also came in handy.\n“We tried to incorporate the idea of death in all her memories,” Swaroop said. In one of her jokes, Issarsingh mentioned that she was recently promoted as the eldest in the family after the death of her elder sibling. “My younger sister is now waiting for her promotion,” was her punch line. She agreed to this one after some resistance. “It was difficult to convince Pooran Didi that as a standup comic, it is okay to make a joke involving her family,” Swaroop said.\nThe performances of the four patients have garnered praise from across India. People have called them strong, inspiring and courageous. And by lightening up about their own imminent death, they have conveyed a powerful message: If you can’t talk about death, it’ll be harder to consider palliative care, which could ease pain in someone’s final days.

In this case, Wittum and his team from Ohio State University—where Wittum is chair of the department of veterinary preventive medicine—found what is known as carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae on a pork farm in the Midwest. CREs have been classified as an urgent threat by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, owing to these superbugs having “become resistant to all or nearly all the antibiotics we have today”—including the class of antibiotics called carbapenems, one of the last remaining groups of antibiotics that are still effective in treating potentially fatal multi-drug-resistant infections in people.\n“We weren’t expecting this, and we were quite surprised,” Wittum told Maryn McKenna at Fern’s AG Insider. “We had predicted that the common CREs in U.S. health care would be the ones we would first start to see in animals, but this is a really unusual one”—not least because carbapenems aren’t even used in livestock. Wittum and his team had gone searching for bacteria that are resistant to another class of antibiotic, cephalosporins, which are commonly used in pigs.\nMeaning what? Well, somehow potentially disease-causing bacteria resistant to an antibiotic of last resort for humans ended up on a pig farm where the animals never received that antibiotic. More research is necessary to determine how it might have happened, but it suggests a worrisome new wrinkle in the spread of antibiotic-resistant superbugs: People (e.g., farmworkers) could be transporting strains of bacteria to factory farms. There, the bacteria can grow into superbugs as the strains are exposed to a plethora of antibiotics, which they develop an ever stronger resistance against.\nIndeed, despite years of increasingly dire warnings from medical experts and public health advocates, some 70 to 80 percent of all antibiotics used in the United States aren’t used to treat sick people or even sick animals. Rather, they are given to otherwise healthy livestock to promote growth and prevent illness—the sort of illness that’s inevitable on your average overcrowded factory farm. The Food and Drug Administration has been ridiculously slow to address the problem and, to date, hasn’t taken any serious action that would stem the tide of antibiotic abuse on factory farms. On the international front, more than 190 nations signed on to a United Nations declaration in September promising to take action to address the mounting crisis of antibiotic resistance. But the declaration is nonbinding and doesn’t set any firm targets for reining in the overuse of these lifesaving drugs that are rapidly losing their potential to, well, save lives.\nAs David Wallinga, a physician and senior health officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, put it to Fern’s Ag Insider, “The pattern we see with enormous antibiotic use in livestock, including pigs, is: ‘Oh, that’s not a problem.’ And then the next stage is, ‘Well, it’s a hypothetical that’s a problem.’ And then, ‘Well, it might be a problem in the United States, but people aren’t dying yet.’ And the last stage is, ‘Well, not very many people are dying.’ As a public-health person, I don’t want to see us get to that last stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.newsminer.com/news/alaska_news/moderate-earthquake-rattles-alaska-s-west-aleutian-islands/article_60e2288d-04c2-57ce-bb41-efbfd0a518b4.html","title":"Moderate earthquake rattles Alaska's west Aleutian Islands","author_text":"","keywords":["General News","Earthquakes","Natural Disasters","Accidents And Disasters","Property Damage","Tsunamis"],"publication_text":"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner","description":"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A magnitude 6.9 earthquake rumbled north of Alaska's Aleutian Islands but did not cause a tsunami or damage structures.","date":"","full_text":"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A magnitude 6.9 earthquake rumbled north of Alaska's Aleutian Islands but did not cause a tsunami or damage structures.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey says the earthquake occurred at 2:24 p.m. about 127 miles northwest of Attu Island near the far west end of the Aleutians.\nThe Alaska Earthquake Center says the moderate earthquake was at a depth of about 16 miles.\nResidents of Shemya Island about 147 miles southeast of the earthquake felt the ground move.\nAttu is nearly 1,500 miles southwest of Anchorage.\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

What gives? Perhaps she didn’t see it yet…or maybe she doesn’t like the baby’s outfit. Maybe she thinks you’re not a good mother.\nAnd what about that friend of yours from high school?

It followed 182 dual-earner couples who were expecting their first child across the year surrounding their transition to parenthood.\nWhen their babies were 9 months old, we surveyed these mothers and fathers about their use of Facebook and other social networking sites in the early months of parenthood.\nWe asked our questions of fathers as well as of mothers, but we quickly found that mothers were the ones spending more time on social networking sites and taking primary responsibility for posting baby photos. Thus, we focused our research on new mothers.\nGreater Facebook activity was also linked to elevated parenting stress for new mothers.\nOne of the first things we discovered was that certain mothers–specifically, those who were more concerned with others validating their identities as mothers and those who believed that others expect them to be perfect parents–were more active on Facebook. They reported stronger emotional reactions when posted photos of their child received more or fewer likes and comments than anticipated.\nWe then tested whether Facebook use was associated with elevated depressive symptoms in the first months of parenthood. Indeed, we found that mothers who were more prone to seek external validation for their mothering identity and were perfectionistic about parenting experienced increases in depressive symptoms indirectly through higher levels of Facebook activity. Moreover, greater Facebook activity was also linked to elevated parenting stress for new mothers.\nInevitable comparisons bring stress\nHow might greater Facebook use lead new mothers to feel stressed and blue?\nA related study may provide an answer. Based on survey data from 721 mothers, Sarah Coyne from Brigham Young University and her colleagues reported that mothers who more frequently compared themselves to others on social networking sites felt more depressed, more overloaded in the parental role, and less competent as parents.\nIt may not merely be time spent on social networking sites, but rather how mothers spend their time on these sites.\nThe authors noted that people tend to portray themselves in a highly positive manner on social networking sites. This may be particularly true for mothers, who can feel pressured to be perfect parents.\nIf you are comparing yourself to others’ seemingly perfect images of parenting and family life, you may inevitably come up short. This may be especially true for new mothers whose experiences were different from expectations. Think about the new mother who was determined to have a natural birth but ended up having a cesarean section, or the new mother whose child was born premature or with a developmental disability.\nThus, it may not merely be time spent on social networking sites, but rather how mothers spend their time on these sites and whether mothers compare themselves to others that may ultimately affect mothers’ adjustment to parenthood and well-being.\nMeeting for coffee might be more meaningful\nSo, should mothers give up Facebook and other social networking sites? Not necessarily.\nEven though my research and that of others has highlighted the perils of social networking sites, other studies have shown that social networking can benefit mothers through maintaining and strengthening relationships with family and friends. And, my own work found that mothers for whom a greater proportion of Facebook “friends” are family members or relatives experience greater parenting satisfaction.\nHowever, I think mothers should carefully consider their motivations for using Facebook and their reactions to Facebook activity. If you find you are obsessing over “likes” on your photos, consider turning off notifications on Facebook and logging on only at certain times of the day.\nOr, if time spent on Facebook leaves you feeling blue, you may benefit from taking a break from Facebook for weeks or months and instead focus on phoning long-distance friends and meeting local ones face-to-face for coffee.\nAll parents who use Facebook and other social networking sites can help too by working harder to share the struggles as well as the triumphs of parenting. They can also support instead of criticize mothers who portray themselves in a less-than-perfect–but more authentic–light.\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Previously, there were not enough births following exposure to the Zika virus to make such estimates.\nThis new report reviewed nearly 2,550 cases of women with possible Zika virus infection who completed pregnancies — meaning they gave birth, miscarried or experienced stillbirth — from Jan. 1, 2016 to April 25, 2017.\nRoughly 1,500 of those women had Zika infection actually confirmed by laboratory testing.\nEight percent of offspring of pregnant women in U.S. territories with a positive nucleic acid test for Zika infection in the first trimester had birth defects linked to the virus. By contrast, 5 percent of these infants did when infection occurred in the second trimester, and 4 percent in the third trimester.\n“It’s incredibly useful,” said Dr. Laura Riley, a specialist in high-risk pregnancies and infectious disease at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n“Patients want to know what is the likelihood their baby could be damaged. At least now, I feel like I had some numbers I can utilize in counseling.”\nC.D.C. researchers classified cases by the trimester in which the laboratory test was conducted or symptoms were reported, said Peggy Honein, the chief of the birth defects branch at the C.D.C. That “may not represent the precise timing of infection.”\nThe data reported to C.D.C. came from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, American Samoa, and the United States Virgin Islands.\nIn total, the agency counted 122 babies with possible Zika-related birth defects, such as neural tube defects, eye abnormalities or microcephaly, an unusually small head.\nPreviously, Puerto Rico’s department of health had only reported about 35 cases in which a fetus was lost or baby was born with Zika-related birth defects, raising concerns that the extent of damage to infants has been underplayed on the island.\nOn a call with reporters, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the acting director of the C.D.C., replied, “We do believe that Puerto Rico authorities are doing a very good job right now in evaluating babies whose mothers had Zika infection, and characterizing them and reporting in.”\nOn Monday, Puerto Rico declared that its Zika epidemic had ended, based on data showing the number of new cases had fallen. Regardless, C.D.C. officials said today that they still advised pregnant women to avoid traveling to Puerto Rico and to protect themselves against mosquito bites, if they do.\n“We do agree that the disease went up and it’s come down, but that the risk is ongoing and that’s why they are continuing intensive surveillance and outreach,” Dr. Schuchat said.\nDr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., said of Zika, “It may not be epidemic anymore, but it’s endemic” in Puerto Rico.\n“What we often see with this type of infection, it’s really bad in the first year and less bad in future years,” he added. “That’s why C.D.C. has retained its travel guidance.”\nDr. Frieden also cautioned that this report “is a minimum estimate of the number of infants who may be Zika-affected,” in Puerto Rico, because not all women whose infections were confirmed in the first trimester have given birth yet.\n“The report mentions that only 18 percent of pregnancies they identified were in the first trimester, while you’d expect it to be a third,” he said.\nTesting pregnant women for Zika will be routine in Puerto Rico, Dr. Schuchat said.\nWomen who do not have any symptoms of Zika virus still may give birth to a baby with Zika-related birth defects, research has shown. The only way to catch those infections is to screen women because they may have been exposed to Zika-infected mosquitoes or may have had sexual contact with an infected partner.\nIn this new report, “The presence or absence of symptoms was not predictive of whether a baby would be damaged,” Dr. Riley said. “There were women who had asymptomatic Zika whose babies were damaged.”\nCurrently, only about 60 percent of babies born alive in United States territories had results of Zika laboratory testing reported to pregnancy and infant registries. It’s important that all babies who may have been affected are monitored, as early intervention can help.\nFor instance, some babies who appear normal at birth later develop an unusually shrunken head. Only with long-term tracking can health officials get an accurate estimate of the scope of the problem.\nEven now, Puerto Ricans often do not take every precaution to avoid Zika infection. In another C.D.C. report released on Thursday, roughly 88 percent of residents with a recent birth said they had used screens on doors to keep mosquitoes at bay.\nBut 56 percent of roughly 1,800 sexually active pregnant women reported never using condoms to protect themselves from getting Zika from a sexual partner."},{"url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/could-single-payer-health-care-come-to-washington-state-one-lawmaker-wants-to-find-out","title":"Could single-payer health care come to Washington state?

The collective experience of black men in the criminal justice system is sobering. African Americans are 2.5 times more likely to be arrested than whites, and numerous studies have shown that black men are disproportionately targeted, stopped, frisked, and searched through the practice of racial profiling. Black men end up in prison more often, receive longer sentences than similarly situated white men, and are more likely to be killed during police encounters than white men – 21 times more likely.\nBut, as criminal defense attorneys, we can attest to the fact that as harshly and as unfairly as black men have been treated in the criminal justice system, the fate of black boys has been worse.\nDecades of data show that the journey to racial disparity begins when black men are boys. Black boys are policed like no other demographic. They are policed on the street, in the mall, in school, in their homes, and on social media. Police stop black boys on the vaguest of descriptions – \"black boys running,\" \"two black males in jeans, one in a gray hoodie,\" \"black male in athletic gear.\" Young black males are treated as if they are \"out of place\" not only when they are in white, middle-class neighborhoods, but also when they are hanging out in public spaces or sitting on their own front porches.\nAdolescence is a critical time during which young people come to understand and respect or resent the law and legal institutions. Negative attitudes about the police acquired during childhood and adolescence have a \"lasting\" effect as youth transition to adulthood. The long history of aggressive and biased interactions with the police — perceived or real — has socialized a generation of black boys to avoid contact with the police whenever possible and if not, to be hostile — sometimes outright confrontational — with police.\nBlack boys who congregate on the \"corner\" attract the attention of the police day or night. Even when they \"dress nicely\" or \"drive nice cars\" young black males cannot avoid police surveillance since such signs of wealth among black youth are presumed to be associated with drug dealing. Black boys describe their neighborhoods as over-policed and say officers stop them multiple times a day to pat them down and ask questions like \"Where are you coming from?\" and \"Where are you going?\"\nThese stories are significant not only for the debilitating and conditioning impact they have on these youth, but also for the message they send to black boys.\nVideotaping, cursing, ignoring an officer's orders and running away provoke even greater hostility, disrespect and often physical force from the police. Not surprisingly, black youth are more likely to experience a use of force than white youth.\nBlack boys are angered not only by the frequency with which they are stopped, but also by the treatment they experience during these stops. They describe police as belligerent and antagonistic and are especially outraged by the officers' use of racial slurs, profanity and demeaning terms like \"punk\" and \"sissy.\" They complain about police stops that are too often initiated by physical contact such as grabbing, pushing, shoving, pulling or tackling the youth to the ground.\nOnce on the ground, black boys are sometimes held down by multiple officers who sit or lie on them while other officers kick, punch or mace them. More violent encounters include billy clubs or chokeholds like the one that killed Eric Garner in New York. Victims of police violence include black boys like LaQuan McDonald, Tyre King, and most recently Jordan Edwards. Fear of violence by police is now the norm for black boys.\nIn a recent study of police perceptions of childhood innocence, researchers showed police officers a series of photographs of young white, black and Latino males engaged in some purported criminal activity and asked them to estimate the age of each child. While the officers overestimated the age of adolescent black felony suspects by 4.59 years, they underestimated the age of adolescent white felony suspects by one year. Because of these types of distorted perceptions, black boys are more likely to be treated as adults much earlier than other youth, more likely to be arrested, harassed and assaulted for normal adolescent behavior, and more likely to be perceived as culpable and deserving of punishment or even death.\nConsider the police encounter with Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was killed by police on November 22, 2014, after a witness called 911, reporting \"a guy with a pistol\" that was \"probably fake.\" When police officers arrived, they described a much \"older\" person, weighing 170 pounds, standing 5 feet 7 inches tall and wearing size 36 pants and a man's extra-large jacket. The officers were doing what empirical research on implicit racial bias suggests that police do: routinely overestimate the age and the perceived threat of young black boys.\nIf we expect any meaningful change in the relationship between black men and the police, we have to start early. We have to help police resist the faulty perceptions of black youth as violent and aggressive and work to develop black boys' faith in law enforcement. To aid this reform, we should revisit our extensive reliance on police in schools, mandate officer training on adolescent development and implicit bias, and require deep shifts in police policy and procedure to facilitate new opportunities for genuine, positive interactions between black youth and the police. Without these reforms, the unfair policing of black boys — and black men — will continue.\nAngela J.

Take House Speaker Paul Ryan’s comments on Wednesday morning. First, consider what Ryan did not say. He didn’t attack former FBI Director James Comey. When Trump fired Comey a week ago, Ryan endorsed his actions, saying the former FBI Director “had just basically lost the confidence of a lot of Republicans and a lot of Democrats based upon his conduct.”\nRyan did not repeat those criticisms on Wednesday, a day after the New York Times reported that contemporaneous notes from Comey portray Trump privately urging Comey to end the criminal investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. And while he mentioned that members of Congress would likely ask Comey why he didn’t “take action at the time” when Trump allegedly pressured him to close the Flynn investigation, Ryan didn’t emphasize the point. Second, he didn’t attack the media. He said vaguely “there are some people out there who want to harm the president.” But he didn’t buttress the central talking point of Trump defenders: that the real scandal is the alliance between Democrats, the “deep state” and the liberal media to bring down a president they hate.\nEven more importantly, Ryan endorsed House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Jason Chaffetz’s demand that Comey hand over documents detailing Trump’s alleged interference. That may not seem significant. But a source close to the congressional GOP tells me that, in backing Chaffetz, Ryan defied the White House, which would have preferred him to say that he lets committee chairmen make their own judgments.\nMany in Ryan’s caucus would have preferred him to say that too. Given how gerrymandered congressional districts are, most Republican House members represent territory where Trump remains popular, at least among the GOP activists with whom they frequently interact. According to the source, some House Republicans appreciate it when Ryan distances himself from Trump because it gives them cover. But a larger number don’t. They spend their days fleeing local journalists who want them to comment on every Trump outburst. When Ryan criticizes Trump, even mildly, that gives the local media a hook, and makes it harder for them to stay silent.\nRyan has now legitimized Chaffetz’s investigation. He’s solidified the new congressional GOP line, which is not “this is a witch-hunt and a diversion,” but “let’s get all the facts.” And from John McCain to writers at National Review, more and more conservatives are saying that if the facts reported by the New York Times over the last few days are true, Donald Trump should lose his job.\nThis morning, Ryan took the first steps toward being able to one day say that too."},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-05-15/thousands-yemen-get-sick-entirely-preventable-cholera-outbreak","title":"Thousands in Yemen get sick in an entirely preventable cholera outbreak","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Public Radio International","description":"As Trump heads for Saudi Arabia, a cholera outbreak in Yemen is tied to war damage from Saudi airstrikes — which are supported and fueled by the United States.","date":"","full_text":"RTSRQPB.jpg\nCholera is spreading rapidly across Yemen just ahead of President Donald Trump's trip to its northern neighbor, Saudi Arabia.

Nobody wants you to.\"","date":"2017-05-17","full_text":"Medical bills are the gift that keeps on giving. Having lost my husband in January, I can attest that not even death puts an end to the steady stream of bills for his care that I still get in the mail. Balance billing, services not covered, out-of-network doctors ― they all come back to haunt you in the form of bills ― including a good number from doctors you’ve never met or heard of, and who you don’t when or why even saw your loved one.\nThe bills? I expected them. What I didn’t expect was to learn that medical bills notoriously contain errors ― big errors. While there are no comprehensive statistics on medical-billing mistakes, Stephen Parente, a professor of health finance at the University of Minnesota who has studied the subject extensively, told HuffPost that his unpublished research put it at 30 percent to 40 percent of all bills except pharmacy bills. Groups that review bills on patients’ behalf, including Medical Billing Advocates of America and CoPatient, put the error rate much higher ― closer to 80 percent to 90 percent.\nAnd it has serious consequences: Medical billing errors mar the credit reports of roughly 7 million Americans, a spokeswoman for the Commonwealth Fund, a Washington-based nonprofit focused on health-care research, told HuffPost. The credit rating agency Equifax found in an audit that hospital bills totaling more than $10,000 contained an average error of $1,300.\nWhy are there so many errors being made?\nThe answer is simple, says Pat Palmer, national expert and founder of Medical Billing Advocates of America: Insurers don’t actually care. They negotiate a lower rate with hospitals and other medical providers, so the amount of the bill and whether it contains overcharges doesn’t really matter to them. In fact, they rarely even ask to see an itemized bill ― they just work off what is known as a summary bill. Insurance companies don’t have nearly enough staff to review itemized bills in every case, Palmer said, nor would they see a need to when they have already contracted for a lower rate anyway.\nPalmer adds, “There’s a reason you can’t understand your hospital bill. Nobody wants you to be able to.”\nShe runs her business of reviewing patient bills entirely on commission. In other words, MBAA is so confident they’ll find overcharges, their commission is 25 percent of whatever money they recover for the client.\n“Almost every hospital bill has some kind of error,” said Palmer, who has been in business for about 25 years and now operates in 30 states.\nWhat do the errors look like?\nInpatient hospital stays are a big-ticket item, and frequently Palmer spots two or three charges for the same item. For example, you pay about $10,000 a day for a bed in the ICU, which includes the higher-level care of specially trained nurses, life-saving equipment and supplies. Yet you might get billed $2,000 a day for ventilator equipment on top of that. The ventilators are part of the high-priced daily ICU bed and shouldn’t be billed for separately, Palmer said.\nThe MBAA website offers more examples: You arrive at the emergency room on Tuesday at 10 p.m. and the doctor writes an order to admit you as inpatient to the ICU at 11:35 p.m. ― but the room isn’t ready, and you don’t move into it until 2 a.m. Wednesday. The hospital charges you $3,000 for the ICU on Tuesday. Their reason for the full-day charge on Tuesday: The doctor wrote the order before midnight. But if the patient never saw the inside of the ICU until Wednesday, the hospital shouldn’t be able to charge for it.\nBlow the whistle, the MBAA urges. A patient must physically occupy a room/unit to incur a daily room charge. A written order to admit does not meet the definition of room occupancy.\nBy not seeing an itemized bill, you might overlook some gems like these that Palmer discovered for clients: a mucous recovery system billed at $11.75 turned out to be a box of tissues, and a comfort support device for $120 was actually a teddy bear for the patient to clutch to her chest post-surgery in case she coughed.\nWhile technically not over-billing, getting zapped by an out-of-network provider who won’t settle for what your insurance wants to pay leads to a different kind of pain.\nIn my own case, I received a bill for $1,600 for a plastic surgeon called by the nursing home to examine my husband for bedsores that had developed and festered during his stay there. The plastic surgeon did not personally see my husband, but sent over his nurse practitioner, who changed the dressing on my husband’s wounds in a visit that was completed in less than 10 minutes.\nIt turns out the doctor the nursing home called was out of network and tried to balance-bill me. For the uninitiated, a balance bill is when the doctor doesn’t accept what your insurance paid him and wants you to pay him more money.\nLots of people get nailed by doctors who only appear to be on staff at the hospital. They aren’t, and instead work for businesses that arrange staffing for the hospital. So in plain English, you go to a hospital that is in your insurance network expecting what happens to you there to be covered, and it’s not.\nThese out-of-network doctors who won’t take your insurance lurk in the strangest of places in your in-network hospital: They are the hospitalists who see patients all day long, and many are the anesthesiologists who work in the operating room. Has anyone who is strapped to a gurney and being wheeled into surgery ever stopped to ask the doctor who is anesthetizing them whether he takes Blue Cross? Of course not. And can you imagine telling the ER doctor with the paddles to please back away from the patient having heart failure unless he’s in-network?\nThis out-sourcing of talent has gotten to be such a problem that 12 states have banned the practice. For example, if you are in New York, every provider who treats you in an in-network hospital must accept the in-network negotiated rate and may not send you a bill.\nInaccurate charges appear on doctors’ office visits as well. There are five levels of office visits, as far as billing is concerned. A level 1 visit is the simplest and doesn’t even require that the doctor be in the room; a nurse practitioner or nurse may deliver the care, and it can be something as minor as getting a monthly vitamin B12 or allergy shot. A level 5 visit is supposed to be for more complicated conditions and generally involve some kind of treatment. But, Palmer said, she’s seen it applied to an office visit for diaper rash where the nurse’s application of ointment was billed as a “treatment.”\nProPublica took a close look at how doctors billed for office visits, which account for about $12 billion in Medicare spending every year. They found that typically, doctors only charge for one or two of these high-level visits per year for each patient. But nationwide, about 1,800 doctors always bill at the highest level possible for routine office visits.\nOvercharges sometimes are caused by human error, such as a wrong billing code being entered. Those are the types of mistakes that can be easy to spot. They include services that weren’t performed, tests that were canceled, and duplicate charges.\nWhy aren’t insurers and the regulatory agencies screaming bloody murder about billing errors?\nIsn’t it fair to ask where our insurance company or the government are in all this? If you are in an employer-sponsored plan and work for a large company, your employer may have some pull.\nWhy, pray tell, should I have to pay someone to sort through my husband’s hospital bills because my private insurer and Medicare don’t demand that the hospital provide them with an itemized bill? How can I tell if I’m being overcharged without billing transparency?\nFor what it’s worth, hospitals say detailed bills are simply too complicated for patients and that they provide the information required by insurers.\nBut most insurance companies don’t cover cosmetic procedures, and thus, patients want to know how much a procedure will cost them. If plastic surgeons and providers of Lasik can give you a clear price up front, why can’t others in medicine?\nWhy does this all matter?\nIn other industries, lawmakers have stepped up and helped end unscrupulous practices. The 1968 Truth in Lending Act gave us clearer terms in writing loans and offering consumer credit. After the housing crisis, the 2009 Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act insisted that lenders provide clear information to home buyers so no one would get blindsided again with adjustable rates or mortgages they would never be able to afford. So, why not help fix the issues in health care billing?\nThe problem is, insurance companies have no financial incentive to hunt down mistakes on your behalf. They negotiated their rates with hospitals and doctors long before you got sick, and the dollar amount on the bill they receive might as well be a toddler’s drawing. But it’s you ― the patient ― who gets zinged in the form of paying out of pocket for high deductibles and co-pays.\nAmerica’s Health Insurance Plans, the umbrella lobbying group for health insurers, told HuffPost in an email that health plans provide explanation-of-benefits statements, customer service lines and directories of in-network providers “hoping to educate and engage consumers on their plan benefits to avoid mistakes or issues such as balance billing.”\nBeyond that, consumers are apparently on their own."},{"url":"http://www.startribune.com/inmates-dakota-county-struggle-with-transit-from-jail-in-hastings/422666604","title":"Inmates, Dakota County struggle with transit from jail in Hastings","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Star Tribune","description":"It's enough of a concern that county officials are now meeting to look at the problem, which has some hitchhiking or walking along Hwy. 55.","date":"","full_text":"Damien Agboola stared sheepishly out the open door of the green and white cab, weighing his next move.\nThirty minutes before, the door to the Dakota County jail had slammed behind him. He was free, but had just his cellphone and $20 on his debit card — not enough to pay the $50 fare to travel from Hastings to the Apple Valley Transit Station, where he could catch a bus to his friend’s house in St. Paul.\nHis aunt couldn’t come get him. His cousin had turned off his phone.\nAgboola and other just-freed inmates want to get on with their lives — but some find they can’t even get out of Hastings.\nLacking transportation, they often hitchhike or walk along Hwy. 55, rankling some locals. It’s enough of a concern that county officials are now meeting to look at the problem.\n“It is definitely an issue,” said Brian Kopperud, Dakota County’s community corrections director. “It’s not as simple as saying, ‘Oh, here’s a bus token,’ because oh, there’s no bus.”\nThe lack of transportation is just another obstacle for the 800 people booked into the jail monthly, half of whom live in another county.\n“The first 72 hours that somebody gets out of [incarceration] are probably the most crucial,” said Chris Doege, re-entry services manager for Amicus’ Reconnect program, which helps people convicted of crimes when they’re released.\n“If their first experience getting out is that they’ve got to hoof it to wherever, bad things can happen.”\nIn response to concerns, Sheriff Tim Leslie and representatives from three other county departments have met several times. This month, they’ll begin surveying people about transportation needs as they exit the jail.\nAs Agboola, 31, considered his options, he knew what he was up against.\n“I’ll be stranded for a long time,” he said. “Walk from here to Apple Valley? That would take like five years.”\nKelly Harder, Dakota County’s community services director, said he has spotted former inmates walking along the road in Hastings on many occasions. He’s picked them up a handful of times.\nLast summer, he recalled stopping for a 67-year-old veteran hitchhiking on a steamy, 100-degree day. The man was trekking 12 miles to South St. Paul because he had no money or phone. He wasn’t allowed to bring them when he was picked up on a warrant, Harder said.\nPart of the problem is the sudden nature of going to jail.\n“Few, when they woke up in the morning, were planning to go to jail,” Harder said. “Whether or not they have resources, they might not have any on them at the moment.”\nThere’s also uncertainty in a person’s release date and time, so it’s difficult to plan ahead. While someone may have a hunch that they’ll be let go after a court date, the discharge process can take hours.\nThe jail’s relative isolation is a “geographic reality” of being in Hastings, Harder said, though it isn’t alone.\nRelease from the Washington County jail in Stillwater poses some of the same problems as Dakota County, said Roger Heinen, jail commander. There’s a bus schedule — with limited routes and times — in the lobby and free phone calls.\n“Besides that, there’s not much more we can do,” he said.\nBut other suburban counties said they have transportation under control. Most of the 250 inmates leaving the Carver County jail in Chaska each month get rides from family or friends, and the social services department gives out bus tokens, said Reed Ashpole, jail administrator.\nAnoka County’s jail has an advantage over Hastings because Anoka is more centrally located, said Dave Pacholl, jail commander. “We’re lucky in that we have a number of transit options,” he said.\nDakota County officials know there’s a lack of east-west transit options in the county, said Commissioner Mike Slavik. The County Board approved the results of a study exploring possible transit corridors May 9. Hwy. 55 didn’t make the top five list, Slavik said, but county staff are working on other options.\nOne possibility is to get the jail on the schedule for Transit Link, the Metropolitan Council’s dial-a-ride service, Slavik said.\n‘I have the whole day’\nJessica Genung grew up in Hastings and works at the nearby Wal-Mart. She said people fresh out of jail sometimes approach the customer service desk to ask about a ride. “It would be cool if they had transit buses that would bring them where they needed to be,” Genung said.\nDoege, who runs the Amicus Reconnect program, said that even a few dollars in bus fare is a stretch for some because they haven’t worked recently.\nIf they are estranged from family or don’t have a support system, getting a ride may be difficult, he said. And they face other challenges in surviving outside jail, part of why some end up incarcerated again.\n“They deserve a second chance,” Doege said. “Every time we put up a barrier, no matter how seemingly insignificant … the likelihood that they’re going to be successful is less.”\nLeslie, the county sheriff, said state law requires him to deliver inmates to and from jail.\nHowever, nothing requires the county to transport people back to where they came from once they’re freed. He said it would help to have a shuttle to the Apple Valley Transit Station.\nA photographer said he’d give Agboola a lift to the bus station if he could stick around for awhile.\n“Honestly, I can wait,” he said. “I have the whole day.”"},{"url":"http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Energy/2016/1002/Hawaii-s-bees-join-endangered-species-list-but-hope-remains","title":"Hawaii's bees join endangered species list, but hope remains","author_text":"The Christian Science Monitor","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Christian Science Monitor","description":"Several types of yellow-faced bees native to Hawaii were classified as 'endangered,' a move many hope will protect the pollinators who play a crucial role in the local ecosystem.

While human development and interaction with the bees and their habitat has played a destructive role, other insects, including invasive bees from India and ants that aren’t native to Hawaii, have had a negative impact on the bees.\nThe announcement, which comes just after certain Midwestern bees were considered for protection, may cause initial alarm, but scientists say that it’s not too late to save the species and that putting protective measures in place could have great benefits for the bees.\n\"A lot of people think of Hawaii as a lost cause because we have so many invasive species,\" says Cynthia King, an entomologist with Hawaii's Division of Forestry and Wildlife, told National Geographic, but \"we're really well positioned right now to make headway for the bee.\"\nOnce the most populous insect species in Hawaii, yellow-faced bees have seen a sharp decline in their numbers over the past century. Humans are to blame for destroying bee habitats and using cropdusting that can wipe out large populations of the insects, but in Hawaii in particular, nonnative species have inflicted their own harm.\nInvasive bees originally from India have settled in where the yellow-faced bees once thrived, creating competition for plants and taking over nesting areas, National Geographic reported. They’ve also had to battle “alien ants,” which feed on the larvae from yellow-faced bees’ nests.\nAuthorities say the categorization will allow them to implement recovery programs, gain important funding, and counteract the effects of outside sources. The Fish and Wildlife service will also have a say in any interaction between federal agencies and the species.\n\"As an animal, it can't be taken or harmed or killed by individuals,\" Gregory Koob, conservation and restoration team manager for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Honolulu, told the Associated Press. \"Any research that is done needs a permit from Fish and Wildlife Service unless it's done by a state agency.\"\nThe bees’ uncertain fate has also spurred researchers to seek out innovative solutions that could help to restore their population.\nJason Graham, an entomologist at the University of Hawaii, designed an artificial nest that could protect bees from ants. He found that the bees often build nests in the holes of coral rocks or stems of plants, where they lay eggs and seal the nests. To mimic this, he told National Geographic that he’s created wooden blocks with pre-drilled holes and covered them with a sticky substance that will trap any ants who try to crawl into the nests.\nThe artificial nests could also be placed in areas where the bees’ populations have dwindled the most, serving as a way to reintroduce them to areas where they’re most needed to support the local ecosystem.\n\"Those plants are not only food and nesting habitat for the bees, but they also provide habitat for other animals,\" Mr. Koob said. \"It's the web of life.\"\nInformation from the Associated Press was used in this report."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/17/drugs-opiod-addiction-epidemic-portsmouth-ohio","title":"'The pill mill of America': where drugs mean there are no good choices, only less awful ones","author_text":"Chris Arnade","keywords":["Society","Ohio","Drugs","Methamphetamine (Crystal Meth)"],"publication_text":"the Guardian","description":"For six days in Portsmouth, Ohio, I keep trying to fool myself. Eventually, I am unable to just watch and listen","date":"2017-05-17","full_text":"Portsmouth, Ohio, once known for making things (steel, shoes, bricks), is now known for drugs, and labeled by some as the “pill mill of America”. The city peaked at 40,000 people in 1940, and as it emptied of factories and jobs – some made obsolete, some moved away – it also emptied of people and hope.\nNow it is a town half the size, filled with despair and filling with drugs.\nOn my first night in town, a beat-up car parks next to me, positioned in the darkness cast by my van. The passenger, a middle-aged woman, injects the driver in the neck. He stays still, head tilted to expose a vein, as she works the needle in, while two young boys play in the back seat.\nDone, they pull away as I try to fool myself into thinking I didn’t see what I saw.\nFor six days in Portsmouth, over three trips, I keep trying to fool myself. Eventually, I am unable to just watch and listen.\nPortsmouth is beautiful. It lies along the intersection of the Ohio and Scioto rivers, ringed by sharp hills. It has plenty of well-kept neighborhoods filled with people doing fine, yet living here also means being constantly reminded that things are not all well.\nIn a fast food parking lot, a small group is hanging out, smelling of alcohol, sweat, and piss. On the fringe, under the shade of the awning, a man leans against a shopping cart filled with empty cans, blankets and children’s toys. The cart also holds two small children, one boy and one girl.\nStunned, I go inside to collect my thoughts and watch. A woman in dirty clothes and a tiny pink backpack comes in to clean up and buy food. She hands the food to the man and children, before heading to the roadside, where she stands with a cardboard sign saying: “Homeless Hungry Anything Helps”.\nI go outside to talk to the man. James (his name has been changed) is 39, and the woman with the sign is Meghan (her name was also changed), the mother of the two children, aged two and three.\nThe cart smells, the blankets inside damp and dirty. The kids sit still as we speak.\nJames is polite and soft spoken, his focus shifting between the kids in the cart and Meghan on the corner. He explains that they were evicted a year and a half ago for “non-payment” and after a stint in a shelter, they took to the street. When I ask him how he can be on the streets with two kids, he clarifies: “We ain’t really homeless right now. We crash in a shed behind the house of a friend.” I ask him if the shed has water and heat and he smiles and says: “We have a cord we run out to the shed. It has been warm the last three nights, so that’s good.”\nI tell him I am a reporter writing about drugs and poverty, and ask him if there is anything I can do to help. He smiles and says no, they are all fine.\nI continue to see them over the next few days along a commercial strip, Meghan standing by the side of the road holding her sign, staring straight ahead, her expression vacant, while James pushes the cart with the kids in it, collecting bottles and cans. Sometimes he stops to let them play.\nOne afternoon I run into him in the McDonald’s bathroom, filling plastic bottles with water to clean his children.\nOutside I ask him more questions about his situation, and he tells me his history with drugs. “I was born in Portsmouth and raised around drugs. Everyone used them. My father drank, and I started drinking when I was a teenager. Then started Percocets when I was 19. Then I moved to the harder stuff like Oxy 80s, then heroin.” I ask him if he still uses drugs, “No, I don’t. Well, only Suboxone [an opioid medication used to treat opioid addiction]. I buy it from the street since I don’t have a prescription.”\nMost drivers ignore the family. Police pass without stopping. One woman drops off two slabs of bottled water, and a minister inquires about their condition, but otherwise they are unseen. I think about calling child protective services, but it is clear James cares and is attentive. I also assume I am missing part of their story. Surely others have called. Perhaps others have inquired more than I have. Perhaps things are more complicated than what I see.\nBesides, there is so much visible pain in Portsmouth, it is hard to focus on any one situation.\nA few blocks across the railroad tracks from James and his family is an area with dope-sick women walking a loop around emptied warehouses, smiling and waving at some cars, hiding from others.\nKayla (her name has been changed), 36, calls to me from the passenger side of a parked car. She is dressed in sweatpants and a windbreaker. The driver, Michelle, 32, is dressed in pajama bottoms and a flimsy low cut shirt. They ask if I am a photographer. I tell them yes. Kayla smiles: “You found the hoe stroll.” They both look exhausted, dirty, and sick. “We haven’t had a date today and need a fix bad.”\nKayla started using pills after high school, then moved to heroin, and then four years ago “started prostituting”. I ask her if she is comfortable talking. “Sure, as long as you don’t take a picture of my face. I don’t want my family to see. This is degrading.”\nI ask her about Portsmouth. “There is nothing to do here but drugs. You around family members who use, around friends who use. When you start using drugs you are accepted for who you are, including your imperfections. For many people, myself, that is hard to stay away from.”\nThey sit in the car, listening to the radio, both picking at sores, riffing on their lives. “Being out here, sucking men for money for drugs, this is degrading. I have no interest in sex anymore. I hate men. I just want to get clean and get out of this place.”\nWhile we talk, an older woman, in her late 60s, parks across the street, and then leans against the hood while she smokes. Michelle and Kayla watch her. “She is working the streets. At that age! Daaaaaaaamn.” A pickup truck with a huge American flag decal covering the back window pulls up to her, slows down, and the older woman approaches the truck.\nJen Medve, 35, knows the loop well. She walked and worked it for seven years. When I ask her about it she is simple and blunt: “It was horrid. Just horrid.”\nShe has recently cobbled together a different life, put herself in rehab, gotten off drugs, and is focused on being a mom for her one-year-old daughter, her sixth child.\nHer daughter Cricket (“I like unconventional names”) clings tightly to her as she tells of being pulled into drugs and sex work. “I ran away at 14 because of abuse and ended up in a foster home. Then I bounced around.”\nOnce the drugs began (Vicodin at 24), it progressed to heroin (“everyone was doing it”), and then sex work. “I had to do dope so often I couldn’t maintain a regular job. I started prostituting after awhile. It was either that or be sick. Everybody knows where the girls are and I lived in the area, so anytime I tried to walk, guys would try to pick me up.”\nEventually, when she was desperate enough, Jen “just went with it”.\nI first meet Kimberly Conley, 19, as she sits outside a downtown rehab clinic, gossiping with friends. She stands out. She is happy, shy and sweet, not having succumbed to the hardness and cynicism that can come with addiction.\nHearing her speak is jarring. She tells a rough story in a gentle voice: “I was born a premie – addicted to crack, to a mom addicted to crack who died from heroin in 2015. December 11, 2015. It was like her seventh overdose. My dad? He was in prison for cooking meth. He has been in prison five or six times. I started weed at 12, pills and heroin and meth at 13. At 15, I got pregnant with my first child. I just had my second child.”\nShe was adopted at the age of one by her grandmother, Vickie, who she still lives with in a trailer on a hill. I drive up to meet them, navigating through a working-class neighborhood of small homes, trailers and lots of dogs.\nI find them sitting on the porch, gossiping, and laughing. Vickie is blunt, friendly, and sharp-tongued. She offers me a soda, and when I ask for diet, she laughs. “Who do you think you are? A model? I may be fat, but I can lose the fat, but when you are ugly, you can’t lose the ugly.”\nShe is retired after 28 years as a cook in the school system. When I ask if there are drugs around, she laughs. “Oh honey, yes, this is Portsmouth. This is the armpit of Ohio.” She points to the neighborhood. “Everything around here is dope-town. Xanies, Oxys, meth, we got it all. Nothing for kids here. When I was young we had dances at the community centers. Now they have nothing. No work around here unless you are a nurse, or a doctor, or lawyer.”\nVickie doesn’t do drugs (“except for my smokes”), and so she has become the de facto mother for an entire neighborhood, a calm center in a tornado. That tornado eventually pulled Kim in. “When I adopted Kimberly, I promised her mom I would keep her in her life. Biggest mistake I made.”\nKim gets up to chase after a child and comes back. “I would go hang out at my mom’s trailer, with all my cousins. We would play there, spend evenings there. It is where my mom got me on heroin. At 13. My mom was doing it. Everyone was doing it. I wanted to do it because I thought it would be fun.”\nHer grandmother pulls her on to her lap. “Ain’t she the smartest and prettiest thing? She is still my baby girl. Now I want her to get out and see how other people live the good life. If you are young, you better leave Portsmouth, or else you will get into drugs.”\nKim smiles and hugs her grandmother. “I graduated with honors from high school. I want to join the army and get away. Far, far away. There are so many drugs here. I just don’t want to be a part of it.”\nDuring my time in Portsmouth, I cannot stop thinking about James, Meghan and their kids. I ask everyone about them (including people at the rehab clinic), and many know of them.\nWhen I ask if anyone has called child protective services, or why the police haven’t stopped them, I get variations of “they probably have” or “I assume someone else has, so I haven’t”. Everyone ends with a version of “not sure it will do much good though, since everyone is just so overwhelmed”.\nPortsmouth is overwhelmed, and in danger of becoming far worse. It is in danger of becoming a place so saturated with drugs that the shocking becomes normal. It already is a place where people roll their eyes at ambulance sirens, mouthing “another OD”. It already is a place where some men pester and proposition dope-sick women for sex. It already is a place where some kids’ childhoods are traumas to be navigated.\nPortsmouth is now a town where you see two dirty kids being pushed around in a shopping cart.\nThe last afternoon, I find James playing with his children beneath a flowering tree and I ask once more if there is anything I can do. He says no. I ask him why he keeps the kids with him, and he smiles: “I was raised around drugs. I don’t want that for my kids.”\nI get in my car and I think of everyone I met in Portsmouth, and all the pain I have seen and heard. I think of Kim up on the hill with her grandmother, telling me: “What do I want most? To get away from here, have a job, a home and then kids. I want the fairy tale ending.”\nI call the Scioto County children services and tell them about two kids in a shopping cart. And then I sit, turn on the radio, and feel like complete, utter crap. I feel like complete, utter crap my entire drive home, when I get home, and as I write this.\nAfter a few weeks, I call to follow up. I am told by Dr Lorra Fuller, the executive director of the Public Children Services Association of Ohio, that “the children are safe” but beyond that she cannot speak on case specifics, only procedural generalities.\n“When we get involved with families, with active drug use or homelessness, we achieve safety for the children. Which means we may help the family find residence, or we make take the children into custody, or place them with a relative, or foster care.”\nI don’t feel good about what I did. I came in, saw a lot of pain, and then dealt with it by making a call to possibly have someone’s children taken away. Then I left, a luxury most people in Portsmouth don’t have.\nI also don’t believe I had a choice. I had come to document Portsmouth and found a great deal of despair, including two kids being pushed in a shopping cart near the side of the road. Ignoring them would have been lying about the problem.\nOnce I got closer they appeared to need professional help, so I called for the expertise of child protective services. Not calling would have been denying what I saw.\nThat is the thing about poverty and drugs. There are no good choices, only less awful ones.\nScioto County children services currently has about 220 children in custody, up from about 88 five years ago. It takes donations,directed either to be used for all their families and children, or for a particular family."},{"url":"http://www.cleveland.com/crime/index.ssf/2017/05/heroin_fentanyl_overdoses_in_c.html#incart_m-rpt-1","title":"Suspected heroin, fentanyl overdoses in Cuyahoga County killed 13 over Memorial Day weekend","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"cleveland.com","description":"Thirteen people died as a result of heroin or fentanyl overdoes over Memorial Day weekend.","date":"","full_text":"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office said on Tuesday that 13 people died as a result of heroin or fentanyl overdoses during the three-day Memorial day weekend.\nOf the 13 dead, nine were men and four were women ranging from age 21 to 60.

The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), a 1,170-mile duct to carry oil from North Dakota fields to an Illinois refinery, will proceed without an environmental impact review. Despite protestors camping out for months, the final phase of construction—burrowing underneath the Missouri River, which provides drinking water to the Standing Rock Sioux less than half a mile away— resumed last week. One of the pipeline’s most devoted protestors, however, is making his strongest stand back in his hometown.\nOn the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Nick Tilsen, a 34-year-old member of the Oglala Lakota Nation and founding executive director of the Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation, is breaking ground on nearly three dozen homes and other amenities on 34 acres of land. The planned community for Porcupine, S.D., nearly a decade in the making, will incorporate the latest in sustainability: energy-efficient buildings, a local food network and a walkable, self-contained neighborhood — all elements of the traditional Lakota lifestyle made modern. As debate over the pipeline rages, Tilsen’s fighting on two fronts: protecting the waterway that will provide today’s drinking water to residents and preparing for a “post-petroleum future” tomorrow.\nA Regenerative Community Development\nJudged by per capita income, Oglala Lakota County, one of five counties within the Pine Ridge reservation, is among the poorest places in America. With wages at a paltry $9,150 per person, almost half of all residents—44.2 percent—live in poverty. Only one-tenth of teenagers graduate from college, and barely half of adults are employed. Proponents argue that the pipeline would jumpstart the region’s economy, creating up to 12,000 direct jobs during construction and supporting up to 81,500 more workers tied to the petroleum industry.\nTilsen, however, believes a pipeline that rips through the landscape to deliver an increasingly antiquated energy source cannot restore economic independence. Infrastructure is needed, he agrees, but destitute pockets in the Dakotas need to bolster themselves by building sustainable communities instead.\nRising against what they see as a century of their people’s subjugation for gold and oil, Tilsen and other Lakota youth proposed the development in 2004. “People are facing the threat of resource extraction in many communities, in the form of dams, in oil and gas drilling, in nuclear storage,” he says. “But in the same breath that we talk about what we’re against and what we’re resisting, it’s important that people take back what solutions they want to have. If we’re against this pipeline and unsustainable projects, it’s just as important for us, as indigenous people, to define what we’re for, double down and start working toward the kinds of communities we want.”\nAt numerous gatherings sponsored by the Thunder Valley CDC throughout 2006, members of the entire tribe debated what features make up an ideal town and whether to pursue constructing one. A few tribal elders scoffed at what looked like foolhardiness and doubted that Tilsen’s young cohort could overcome Pine Ridge’s longstanding poverty; others believed the youth needed to focus on pressuring the federal government to uphold existing obligations, not divert attention to a new project.\nTilsen’s persuasion proved effective, and the conversation shifted to what should be built, a discussion that lasted 10 years. As part of a grand vision articulated by the community, Thunder Valley CDC installed the infrastructure — roads, sewers, electricity and broadband internet — in the newly planned development, which is located in Porcupine, a small town roughly midway between the entry to South Dakota’s Badlands National Park and the Nebraska border. During the next decade, 30 single-family homes, 48 apartment units and up to 10 artist studios; a market, a geothermal greenhouse and coops for 400 chickens; a youth shelter and powwow grounds will be constructed. Foundations have been poured for the first seven houses, and one has a roof. This summer, construction will begin on a 4,000-square-foot community center, reports Kaziah Haviland-Montgomery, an architectural fellow.\nIn line with Lakota values, the affordable houses are highly insulated, both to keep out the bitter Dakota winds but also to retain energy from heating. Each will be built with a five-kilowatt-hour solar panel on the rooftop, installed by locals.\nA Sustainable Form of Resistance\nThunder Valley’s plans gained momentum as the Standing Rock movement grew. Those who couldn’t join the protestors viewed working on the development or becoming more conscious of waste as their own forms of organized resistance, notes Cecily Engelheart, Thunder Valley CDC’s communications director.\n“Instead of styrofoam or paper plates at a community feed, we [have discussed] bringing our own picnic box of plates and silverware…It’s those smaller scale actions, really individual choices,” Engelheart explains.\nIf Thunder Valley ends up alleviating the desperation, both economic and environmental, its lessons could be adopted well beyond tribal nations. “If we’re pulling up our sleeves to do it here, then absolutely New York City should do it, as should Boston, Houston and Los Angeles. Everybody should be finding the right way to build equitable and sustainable communities in their city. It’s not just for Indian Country, as much as for humanity,” Tilsen says.\nIn Lakota mythology, there’s a prophecy about a great black snake that slithers across the heartland. Where it burrows underground, the tale goes, the serpent will poison the earth. To many tribal nations, the warning is clear: the impending Dakota Access Pipeline, which will travel under the Missouri River, embodies the creature that elders warned of. Protestors gathered at Standing Rock talk about massing together to kill the black snake.\nBut there’s a lesser-known story about how the serpent must be vanquished. Tilsen grew up hearing that its blood must be drained. In other words, to defeat the pipeline, Americans need to sever their dependence on oil, both foreign and domestic. Otherwise, “the black snake always rears its head,” Tilsen says.\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline may be built, endangering Lakota Nation’s water and sacred lands. But with Tilsen’s strategy, any construction will be a temporary setback. The snake can be outmaneuvered still.\nMORE: How Do You Breathe Life into a Neighborhood That’s Been Forgotten?"},{"url":"http://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/30/npr-after-stabbing-portlands-mayor-wants-2-right-wing-demonstrations-canceled","title":"After stabbing, Portland's mayor wants 2 right-wing demonstrations canceled","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"On Friday, a man yelled hate speech and stabbed three men, according to police.

Does It, Really?","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Philadelphia Citizen","description":"Kenney's budget plan will supposedly fix our pension crisis. His projections seem too optimistic, but it's a step in the right direction.","date":"2017-04-05","full_text":"Early last month, Mayor Kenney gave his annual budget address. I, along with many in the business community, had been hoping for a bold economic development plan, something beyond soda taxes and funding Pre-K. We didn’t hear that, but the Mayor did reveal something rather stunning: that his proposed budget makes great strides in confronting our ever-worsening pension crisis.\nFirst, Kenney ably laid out the problem. “The City’s annual pension contribution has grown by over 230 percent since fiscal year 2001,” he said. “These increasing pension costs have caused us to cut important public services, while the pension fund’s health has grown weaker. In fact, our pension fund has actually dropped from 77 percent funded to less than 50 percent funded, during the same time our contributions were so rapidly increasing.”\nObserving, correctly, that we have on our hands a “systemic problem,” Kenney made his pitch: “I urge Council to adopt the administration’s plan to get the pension fund 80 percent funded in 13 years,” he said. “DC33, our largest union, has already accepted this plan. For future employees, it utilizes a stacked-hybrid model, and for our current employees it requires increased contributions that rise with incomes.”\nWait, what? 80 percent funded by 2031? That was easy. All it takes is asking current city employees to pay in a little more, and future employees to accept a retirement program that’s a little less generous?\n“States and cities routinely pick a very optimistic assumption,” Vague says. “Anything in the 7 or 8 percent range is highly optimistic. The return in the last decade has not been anywhere close to that. And if it’s even a little below your projection, the computation is so sensitive, it makes for a very different outcome a few years down the road.”\nTo be clear, this “fix” doesn’t even follow the private sector reform trend, whereby defined contribution plans have been replaced by 401k plans. We know that what makes the most mathematical sense is that all new city hires be on 401k plans instead of conventional pensions. But that’s tricky politically; in a sign of just how intractable a problem this is, there is widespread resistance not only to messing with the pension plans of existing city workers—but also to changing the plan for those who haven’t even been hired yet.\nThat’s because we’re in widespread denial as to how much of a crisis we’re in. There’s a difference of some $6 billion between the fund’s assets and its obligations to city workers. That means that 16 percent of the city’s annual budget goes to propping up the unfunded balance Kenney speaks of. (Kenney, by the way, doesn’t exactly have clean hands when it comes to our pension mess; it was then-Councilman Kenney’s 2007 law that removed the requirement that the fund be at least 76.7 percent funded before bonuses are paid out.)\nAs the shortfall grows, it diverts more and more spending from other critical areas—education and infrastructure among them. This year, the city will contribute some $630 million to the pension fund—more than the city takes in in property taxes. Just imagine the return on investment we’d see if our pension obligations weren’t draining our general fund. For one thing, we likely wouldn’t have needed a regressive tax on those who drink sweetened beverages to pay for a laudable pre-K program.\nSo given the sheer size of the hole—$6 billion!—could Kenney’s tweak to the current system be close to a panacea? Hardly—though it is an incremental step in the right direction. The question then becomes: Are incremental fixes helpful, or is that just code for more of what generations of politicians have always done: Kick the fiscal can down the proverbial road, convincing themselves they’re simply living to fight another day?\nI’m no fiscal savant, so I turned to a couple: Sam Katz and Richard Vague. Katz is the former Chair of PICA, the city’s fiscal oversight board, and a serial candidate for mayor with a background in public finance. Vague is a Center City venture capitalist, philanthropist and author of 2014’s The Next Economic Disaster: Why It’s Coming and How to Avoid It. Vague and his team of heterodox economists, as part of their challenge to conventional wisdom—they hold that a certain level of private debt is the key factor in triggering economic calamity—has been studying the pension crisis that looms across the country.\n“I hasten to point out that Philadelphia is not even close to being unique in this,” Vague says. “A majority of cities and states have this exact problem. They’re only partially funded and have no reasonable basis for expecting to get back to a stable funding level anytime soon. What suffers are other areas of spending in cities and states. People fuss at me for saying that — ‘How dare you suggest we can’t do it all? We can have roads and education and a generous pension.’ But the math is the math, folks.”\nCollectively, Vague’s research shows, the United States has $2 trillion in unfunded pension obligations. “And it does not look like it is a solvable problem. At all. By anyone.”\nKatz has a good test for determining whether Kenney and Council really believe the mayor’s proposed plan will get the fund to 80 percent funded in 13 years: “Ask them if they’re willing to bet their pensions on that,” he says.\nVague’s normally a jovial guy, which makes me do a doubletake. “Wait,” I say. “That’s really depressing.”\nVague smiles at my naivete. “It is a depressing scenario,” he says, “but it’s pervasive and structural.”\nWhat about Kenney’s plan? “It does not get you to 80 percent,” Vague says. “But we don’t want to be critical because it is at least a positive step. We guess that, without these changes, the pension runs out in a decade. This pushes that out a few years. So it’s a positive step—but it doesn’t get you to 80 percent funded.”\nLike Vague, Katz gives the Kenney administration credit for doing something. “Their plan moves the needle a little bit,” he says.\nBut the math of Kenney’s budget projection, it turns out, is ripped from the pages of a familiar playbook. The Kenney plan assumes that the fund’s rate of investment return will be 7.7 percent.\n“I’d like to meet that broker,” says Katz. It’s an old trick, of the rosy scenario variety. The administration points to the fact that other cities make similar assumptions; Katz says they’re all “self-delusional” and that anticipating outlandish investment growth is essentially a political decision, because a reasonable assumption of, say, 3 percent portfolio growth would drastically throw off the city’s budget and keep the administration from spending what it told voters it would spend. “This is a crisis in full hiding,” he says, “and our solution over a long period of time has been to engage in denial.”\nVague agrees. “States and cities routinely pick a very optimistic assumption,” he says. “Anything in the 7 or 8 percent range is highly optimistic. The return in the last decade has not been anywhere close to that. And if it’s even a little below your projection, the computation is so sensitive, it makes for a very different outcome a few years down the road.”\nAnd just whose judgment are we relying on for managing a pension fund of nearly $5 billion in assets? Our Board of Pensions consists of nine members, chaired by the city’s Director of Finance, and consisting of the Managing Director, City Solicitor, City Controller, Personnel Director, and four members elected by the city’s civil service employees. “Collectively, they have zero experience in investment finance,” Katz says. “[Finance Director] Rob Dubow is a smart guy, but he’s not a pension guy. No one on the board is really qualified to govern a pension fund.”\nOf course, the Board members would say that’s why they use professional managers—though the trend of late is for cities to rid themselves of professional investment managers because of the exorbitant fees they charge. Katz says it would have been hard to do worse than the Board of Pensions did these last few decades. “If, 20 years ago, the city had simply invested in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway stock, we wouldn’t be in the shape we’re in,” he says.\nVague is quick to point out, however, that Philadelphia’s pension woes are not unique. Nationwide, cities and states follow the same “extend and pretend” pension fund strategy. Put a few band-aids on your pension fund shortfall, and maybe it’s something you don’t have to really face while in office. Which might not be irrational—especially since there’s little at the local or state level that can be done to solve the problem. (The unfunded state pension amount is up to a staggering $74 billion)\nThis year, the city will contribute some $630 million to the pension fund—more than the city takes in in property taxes. Just imagine the return on investment we’d see if our pension obligations weren’t draining our general fund. For one thing, we likely wouldn’t have needed a regressive tax on those who drink sweetened beverages to pay for a laudable pre-K program.\nKatz argues that the city could do more, like renegotiate pension fund terms while maximizing worker protections, and selling off city-owned assets and dedicating the proceeds to the pension fund. Philadelphia, after all, is one of the few remaining municipalities in the gas, water, and airport businesses. “Across City Line Avenue, residents get their water and gas from private companies and that seems to work fine for them,” he says.\nFor his part, Vague has a national prescription—a type of grand bargain, that would involve a federal bailout and the placing of state and city pension funds under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974—which governs corporate pension plans and which state and city plans were exempted from. “That left the door wide open for states and cities to do what they wanted in terms of how they fund their programs and structure their projections,” he says. “That’s a fundamental reason we have this problem today.”\nOf course, the notion that this federal government will come to the rescue is laughable on its face. Throughout the nation, our public pension crisis is a slow bleed—something that will quietly continue to drain key public investments. Some states and cities will get to a crisis point, as Detroit experienced. But, Vague warns, “a national consensus that something must be done? That’s not in the cards.”\nHow did we get here? During the boom post-World War II years, we built the fasting growing economy in human history thanks to what Vague calls “heroic” investments in things like the GI Bill of Rights and the Interstate Highway System. But we had low debt levels then; we could build by borrowing. We structured generous pension programs, unaware that the good times would come to an end.\nNow that we’re maxed out and can’t keep up with our obligations, our elected leaders are less reformers and more political pointillists, a dab here and a deft touch there…but what they’re really doing is just putting off judgment day. Katz has a good test for determining whether Kenney and Council really believe the mayor’s proposed plan will get the fund to 80 percent funded in 13 years: “Ask them if they’re willing to bet their pensions on that,” he says.\nSo here’s a radical thought: Maybe the thing to do is to no longer kick the can down the road, to stop the incremental tweaks. It took a crisis for Detroit to ultimately rise from its ashes, after all, and maybe other cities and states should follow suit.\nWhen I run past Vague the idea that maybe we should just pull off our band-aids, he smiles. “That’s an outlandish thought, of course,” Vague says. “You’re suggesting a form of brinksmanship.” And then his smile dissipates. In the mid-20th Century, during the boom years, he explains, the best job you could have was to be a governor or mayor of a big city. How things have changed. “All I can say is, I’m glad I’m not a governor or mayor today,” Vague says, shaking his head.\nHeader Photo: Mayor Jim Kenney addresses the crowd at the annual Chamber of Commerce Luncheon.

Acadia’s historic carriage roads are popular with hikers, bikers, and horseback riders, and serve as the primary connection to the park’s interior. About 20 years ago, with assistance from Friends of Acadia, a nonprofit organization, the park restored all but the most popular carriage road: Eagle Lake Loop. The loop has been in such high demand that park officials have resorted to frequent stopgap fixes, and nearly half of it requires extensive maintenance, at a cost of over $2 million. The deferred maintenance for all carriage roads in the park is $8 million.\nBuilt in the mid-1950s and early 1960s, Acadia’s headquarters is also in dire need of repairs and renovations. One-inch-wide cracks between cinderblocks extend from the roof of the maintenance building to its foundation, sending frigid air inside during the winter. Its roof leaks and is caving in, and wooden boards have fallen from the ceiling. And the park’s administrative office requires a new heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The combined fixes and upgrades will cost about $15 million.\nSieur de Monts, a popular landmark built over a spring, is located within the Cadillac Mountain watershed, an important wetland habitat. The site formerly housed restrooms connected to septic tanks, but testing of nearby water determined that the tanks were leaching and contaminating the watershed. The National Park Service (NPS) redirected the wastewater, but $100,000 is needed to restore the watershed.\nAnd Hulls Cove Visitor Center, at the northern entrance to Mount Desert Island, requires accessibility improvements for visitors using wheelchairs and a new HVAC system, at a cost of $1 million.\nThe park is responsible for creating Bar Harbor as it is today.

He stood out of the crowd.”\nA memorial poster for her son hangs in Evans’ bedroom. Ramos was shot and killed by Vallejo police, who contend he was trying to stab a teenager in January. Ramos’ autopsy results have not been made available to his family.\nNow he’s dead. But that’s not the end of his story, because the official police account of what happened just doesn’t add up. And because the police have refused to release Ramos’ autopsy report, the family’s doubt of what police have told them has deepened.\nAccording to Lt. Jeff Bassett, a spokesman for the Vallejo Police Department, officers responded to a fight at the home involving people with weapons. Neighbors had heard screams, and someone inside the house, where family members and their friends had been drinking for several hours, called police and said Ramos had a knife.\nDuring the fracas, two officers came upon a 6-foot-2, 250-pound 16-year-old boy who was in a “mutual combat situation” with Ramos on the back deck, Bassett told two of my colleagues in the hours after Ramos died.\nOne officer used his Taser on the 16-year-old, who at that point was on top of Ramos. But one of the prongs missed. Moments later, the teen fell on his back and Ramos pounced on him, according to Bassett.\nRamos, Bassett said, had a knife and “presented himself as an immediate and lethal threat to the victim down on his back.” That’s when one of the officers, an eight-year veteran of the force, fired four shots at Ramos.\nRamos’ family disputes just about everything the police have said about the killing.\nThey say Ramos had a knife before he went onto the deck, but not when he was on the deck. What’s more, the teen police say Ramos was threatening has told police Ramos didn’t have a knife, according to an attorney representing Ramos’ family.\nThe family says Ramos was standing when he was shot.\nThe family, which is being represented by John Burris, a well-known civil rights attorney, is demanding that authorities release the autopsy report. The report should reveal the trajectory of the bullets that hit Ramos. But Melissa Nold, who works in Burris’ law office, said police haven’t responded to the family’s demands to release the report.\n“There’s no legitimate reason for not releasing the coroner’s reports. It’s a public record,” she told me. “It may or may not support their version of the event. If it does, it would behoove them to release it.”\nHere’s where the story really gets murky. Police have told the family the officer shot from where he stood at the side of the house — and he was on the ground, not the second-floor deck. If true, the shots would’ve been taken at an upward angle, and the bullets would’ve gone through the rails of a dimly lit deck that was occupied by several others, including police officers.\nI don’t know how Vallejo trains its officers, but shooting in the dark doesn’t seem like proper operating procedure.\nNold said that if Ramos was on top of the teen and if the officer fired from the ground, as the police contend, he would’ve been hit in the back or the side.\n“He would’ve had to have had his back to the person that was shooting on the ground,” said Nold, who viewed Ramos’ body in the morgue. “He was not shot in the back. He was only shot in the front of his body.”\nBurris is also representing the young man Ramos allegedly was about to stab.\n“Angel was not trying to stab him at all,” Nold said.\nThe fight that led to police being called began on the front stoop between Saddler, 27, and her boyfriend Phillip Vaughn, 28. They have three children together. According to Saddler and Vaughn, they had argued and Vaughn had pushed Saddler. Dante Ramos, Saddler’s and Angel Ramos’ 20-year-old brother, confronted Vaughn, who went into the house.\nAs the altercation escalated, another young man who was at the house pushed Vaughn and the teen onto the small deck and locked the door.\nAngel Ramos, who had been sleeping in his room, was awakened by Dante Ramos’ girlfriend. Angel Ramos came out of his room in his boxer shorts. The family doesn’t dispute that Angel Ramos grabbed a knife, but they say it was taken away from him by the young man who had locked Vaughn and the teen out of the house.\n“Angel had a knife, but way before the cops got here,” Saddler said. “He had a knife in the house.”\nSomeone on the deck punched through the window to strike Dante Ramos. Angel Ramos went onto the deck. So did Saddler, who tried to break up the fight. Soon the police arrived shouting commands and with their guns drawn. Saddler’s 9-year-old son, Giovanni Wilson, watched.\n“I see my son standing here,” recalled Saddler, who was sitting on the porch against Vaughn. “I knew my two other babies were in here. I looked up at the officer and I was like, ‘Please don’t shoot. My kids are in the house.’ And he tased me for saying that.”\nVaughn, who admitted to fighting with the Ramos brothers, told me Ramos didn’t bring a knife onto the porch.\n“I seen him when he came outside. He didn’t have no knife,” Vaughn said. “I don’t know why the police are trying to say he had a knife when he came outside. If Angel had a knife, why didn’t they tase Angel first instead of (the teen) first?”\nSaddler told me that when police ordered her, Vaughn and the teen to get down, they took up most of the room on the deck. There was no space for Angel Ramos, especially with officers also on the deck. She and Vaughn didn’t see Ramos get shot. Neither did the teen, but he did tell Nold that Ramos’ body fell on top of him after the shooting.\n“At the end of the day, if he had a knife or not, they didn’t have to shoot him,” said Evans, 53, Angel Ramos’ mother.\nEvans wonders why police treated Ramos differently than the others at the house. Why was he shot and not tased? I wonder the same thing, but Bassett didn’t return my call requesting an update on the investigation into Ramos’ death.\n“They portrayed my son to be freakin’ monster, that he’s out there over the guy getting ready to stab him,” Evans said. “They’re portraying him as a monster that he wasn’t.”\nSan Francisco Chronicle columnist Otis R.

Lee Magee, the brigade commander from Leavenworth, Kan. “I thought we did really well and I am proud of the soldiers in this brigade.”\nDuring the deployment, the Bulldogs were primarily stationed in Kuwait, but trained with about a half dozen Middle Eastern partner nations and helped to support operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThey did about 3,200 partnership engagements, ranging from individual and small team meetings and training up to battalion-level training.\nSince the Bulldogs have returned home, they have been extremely busy.\n(Photo: DAVID BURGE/EL PASO TIMES)\nThey served as the opposing force and observer-coach-trainers during the recently concluded Iron Focus exercise.

You have to ask yourself, why would you do it under those circumstances?”\nTrump’s budget calls for increasing employee contributions to the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) pension by one percent in 2018 and an additional percent each year over five to six years, until employee contributions to their retirement equal the contributions that the government makes. The president argues that the move is necessary to help balance the budget.\nOne Education Department employee, “Luis” — he asked to be identified by his middle name because he’s concerned about retribution from his comments — pointed out that retirement contributions aren’t a matter of choice for feds.\n“When I got my first paycheck, I was like, ‘Wow!’” he said. “As a federal employee, you don’t have a choice to opt out. They’re taking that money from your paycheck regardless.”\nIf the budget is passed, retirees will need to make significant changes, Collender said.\n“One percent doesn’t sound like a great deal,” he added, “But it reduces your ability to spend and that means that your current lifestyle has to suffer compared to what it otherwise would have been.”\nThe Trump budget also calls for:\nAn elimination of the automatic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in the pensions of current and future FERS participants, and\nReducing the COLA for Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) participants by 0.5 percent.\nThe budget also projects changing benefit calculations of future retirees to base them on the highest five consecutive salary years rather than the highest three as it is currently. It also eliminates for future retirees the “special retirement supplement” paid to those under FERS who retire before age 62 until they reach that age and Social Security begins.\n“Federal employees need to be vigilant,” Collender said. “To the extent that they’re allowed under the law, they should let their representatives know that they would be adversely affected by this.” He’s also urging federal employees to save more than the five percent match the government provides for defined benefit plans."},{"url":"https://ww2.kqed.org/bayareabites/2017/05/27/ramen-rock-these-japanese-punk-legends-sing-about-food","title":"Ramen Rock: These Japanese Punk Legends Sing About Food","author_text":null,"keywords":["Music","Ramen","Shonen Knife"],"publication_text":"Bay Area Bites","description":"For over 35 years, the all-female Shonen Knife has been serving up catchy punk titles like \"Wasabi,\" \"Hot Chocolate\" and \"Sushi Bar.\" But don't mistake them for","date":"","full_text":"Listen to the story on All Things Considered:\nBy night, they play gigs. By day, they sample ramen in cities across America.\nThey’re the three women of Shonen Knife, a legendary rock band from Japan. For over 35 years, the band has been serving up infectious punk songs with a delicious twist: Many of them are about food. Think song titles like “Wasabi,” “Hot Chocolate” and “Sushi Bar.” But don’t dismiss them as bubblegum pop: Over the years, some of their biggest fans have included giants of alt-rock music.\nThis spring, Shonen Knife embarked on its latest adventure – a ramen rock tour of the U.S.\nWhy ramen? Well, ramen is really like Japanese soul food, says Daisuke Utagawa, a ramen restaurateur in Washington, D.C., and unofficial ambassador of Japanese food culture. “It’s probably as important as your pizza here.”\nAnd the noodles are becoming all the rage in America. So, to promote its latest album, called Adventure, Shonen Knife is on what it calls the “Ramen Adventure Tour” of the U.S. I met up with the band at Haikan, one of Utagawa’s hip ramen restaurants.\nThe band’s line up has changed over the years, but these days, it consists of drummer Risa Kawano and its two founding members — guitarist Naoko Yamano and her sister, Atsuko Yamano, who plays bass guitar. Like Cher or Beyonce, all three ladies prefer to go by first names only.\nNaoko is the most fluent in English and does most of the talking. I kick off by asking the obvious: Why go on a ramen tour?\n“Sushi is already very popular, but ramen is now happening in America,” Naoko says.\nAnd — oh yeah — they happen to have a hard-rock anthem called “Ramen Rock,” written for a former band mate who had a habit of dining out on the noodles after playing shows. (Ramen is also a traditional hangover food in Japan.)\nNaoko and Atsuko formed Shonen Knife in 1981 in Osaka, Japan. They were inspired by pop punk bands like the Ramones. (In 2011, the band released a tribute album called Osaka Ramones.) These days, Naoko says, she’s more into “’70s hard rock music, like Judas Priest or Black Sabbath or sometimes KISS.”\nNaoko has always been the front-woman. And from the very beginning, many of their songs have been about food. “When I started Shonen Knife, I was ashamed to write about love,” she explains.\nNaoko says romantic love, the standard stuff of music lyrics, was just too embarrassing to sing about. But love of food was another story.\n“I found that eating delicious food is the most important thing for people,” she says. “It’s a kind of universal topic.”\nSo is dieting. Naoko — who is quite petite — says the need to curb her love of cookies inspired the song, “I Wanna Eat Cookies,” which features a memorable refrain that many listeners can identify with: “I wanna eat delicious cookies …. as much as I want to eat!”\nBy 1989, Shonen Knife’s catchy, playful songs had attracted some pretty big-name fans – including influential alternative-rock bands like Sonic Youth, Red Kross and L7, all of whom sang on a tribute album to the group called Every Band Has A Shonen Knife Who Loves Them.\nIn 1991, Nirvana asked Shonen Knife to join them on tour. At the time, Naoko says, she’d never heard of Kurt Cobain and company, but their grunge look gave her pause. “I was so scared because their looking was very wild,” Naoko recalls.\nThat was just as Nirvana’s seminal album Nevermind was blowing up. But as Cobain told MTV News a couple of years later, he was the one in awe of Shonen Knife, watching them perform night after night from the side of the stage. “I was an emotional sap the whole time. I cried every night,” said Cobain, who frequently shared his love of the band with interviewers.\nUnlike Nirvana, Shonen Knife never made it huge. But over the decades, the band has remained a cult favorite. A couple of hours after our ramen dinner, they took the stage at D.C.’s Black Cat. And they kicked things off with a song called “Banana Chips” … of course.\nShonen Knife’s latest U.S. tour wraps up this weekend.\nCopyright 2017 NPR."},{"url":"http://www.wnyc.org/story/long-awaited-waterfront","title":"The Long-Awaited Waterfront","author_text":null,"keywords":["Npr","New York","Wnyc","Arts","Culture","News","Public","Radio"],"publication_text":"WNYC","description":"Residents in Mott Haven have been trying for years to get the industrial, South Bronx waterfront cleaned up. Now, it's ...","date":"","full_text":"The South Bronx waterfront is industrial, smelly, and inaccessible.\nNearly a third of the city’s garbage goes through Mott Haven and is then transferred to trucks or a train that snakes along the Harlem River’s edge, out to garbage dumps around the region.\n“You can smell how horrible it is, that water sitting there, that is all water that leaks from trucks that come by,” said Ed Garcia Conde, a Melrose resident and author of the blog, Welcome2theBronx. “This actually permeates through the neighborhood. On certain days when it’s warm and humid, it stretches around.”\nGarcia Conde and many other South Bronx residents want the waterfront cleaned up — they want esplanades and green space instead of railroads and highways. They've been envisioning what they want the waterfront to become for decades.\nThe city wants it cleaned up too. In 2006 Mayor Bloomberg announced the South Bronx Initiative, a plan to attract development to the South Bronx. It sought to leverage private development to create a continuous promenade on the Bronx side of the Harlem River that would be publicly accessible.\nNow, developers Keith Rubenstein of Somerset Partners, along with the Chetrit Group, are ready to break ground on the first section of the neglected waterfront in Mott Haven. They plan to build six towers on both sides of the Third Avenue Bridge with approximately 1,200 market-rate units.\n“There's a lot of unhappiness, drug needles, other broken bottles to say the least,” said Keith Rubenstein about the area, and he has plans about how to clean it up.\n“We’re taking industrial property that was highly populated with bus and truck traffic and moving that out, taking those buildings down, creating new buildings with open space and access for the public to the waterfront.”\nBut Garcia Conde and others are worried that the market-rate buildings will drive up rents in the area and push out low-income residents who currently live there. People in the community want developers like Rubenstein to include affordable housing in their buildings, but that's not required in the zoning rules.\nTom Angotti, a professor of Urban Studies at Hunter College and author of Zoned Out, Race Displacement and City Planning in New York City, said the problem is bigger than any one developer. He says it’s a public policy issue and that has much bigger consequences.\n“We looked at the rezonings over the last 15 years and you see a pattern,” said Angotti. “The areas that are rezoned for new development do tend to be communities of color, low-income communities, and the areas that have been protected by zoning tend to be white, homeowner areas.”\nA comprehensive plan should take into account the effect it will have on local communities. He says the city’s plans have always been piece-meal and often short-sighted.\n“The city of New York has really never had a comprehensive plan, a land use plan, a long term plan,\" he said. \"Zoning is not the same as planning....It doesn't necessarily presume a broader vision of the future of the city.\"\nMayor de Blasio is trying to solve this growing inequality through his recently approved proposal known as \"Mandatory Inclusionary Housing,\" a citywide program that could lead to more affordable housing.\nBut Mott Haven has already been rezoned several times and mandatory affordable housing isn’t required of developers there.\nRubenstein said he can't satisfy everyone in the community but he planned to build a beautiful public promenade that will be accessible for everyone. He expects to break ground soon on what is a tiny sliver of the South Bronx Waterfront, surrounded by highways, waste transfer stations, and railroads and in the process, start to realize Bloomberg's decade-old vision.\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story misstated where Ed Garcia Conde lives in the South Bronx.

He was taken to a hospital where he died shortly after arrival.\nAn autopsy at the Dane County medical examiner's office confirmed Jones was shot to death.\n\"Homicides in Janesville are pretty infrequent,\" Janesville Police Chief David Moore said Monday. \"The last one we had was over three years ago.\"\nJanesville police believe the homicide stemmed from an argument between Odom and Jones. Police said Odom pulled out a handgun and shot Jones before fleeing.\nSeveral witnesses identified Odom as the shooter, and police later located Odom driving a vehicle on the city's west side, according to police. Authorities pulled Odom over and took him into custody.\nMoore said he put almost all his officers on the case Sunday and he hoped that the prompt resolution would restore a sense of safety to the community. He said teams of officers would be visiting the homes around the site of the homicide to offer reassurance to residents."},{"url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/lured-to-park-with-promise-of-sex-he-was-stabbed-153-times-at-the-hands-of-ms-13/2017/05/29/fb5e541e-43b1-11e7-98cd-af64b4fe2dfc_story.html","title":"Lured to a park with promise of sex, Md. man was stabbed 153 times by MS-13 gang members","author_text":"https://www.facebook.com/DanMorseWriter","keywords":["Ms 13 Murder","Montgomery County Ganag Killing","Villagran Morales","Vanesa Alvarado"],"publication_text":"Washington Post","description":"Woman who admitted to enticing Christian Villagran Morales sentenced to 40 years.","date":"","full_text":"Christian Villagran Morales strolled a path into a darkening, densely wooded park. At his side was a woman he’d met days earlier.\nThat warm summer night, just north of Washington, held promise for the 18-year-old: The woman had said she wanted to have sex.\nLying in wait, 100 yards away, were MS-13 gang members. They knew the woman. And they’d helped her plot the ruse to draw in Villagran Morales. The assailants struck as the pair arrived. They pulled him into the woods, fought him and stabbed him 153 times.\nThe brutal murder in June 2016 of Villagran Morales — a cheerful, well-liked landscaper who had recently moved to Maryland — was one of five MS-13-related killings over 14 months in Montgomery County by a reinvigorated gang. Details of his death have been laid out in two guilty pleas from teenagers who took part.\nUnlike other suspects in the cases, who were recent arrivals to the United States, the woman who has admitted that she lured Villagran Morales to his death in Gaithersburg was born and raised in Montgomery. Vanesa E. Alvarado, now 20, was sentenced to 40 years in prison Tuesday morning, the maximum amount based on an earlier plea agreement.\n“This was a terrible, terrible case,” Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge Anne Albright said from the bench.\nIn court, Villagran Morales’s mother, Bertha Morales, spoke about her son’s assailants, particularly Alvarado, who sat at the end of a long table with her head turned slightly away from Morales and looking down.\n“I cannot even look at her face — that bad woman,” Morales said.\nShe told the judge that Alvarado could have backed out up to the last minute. “What she should have done is to tell him: ‘Look, go away, go back the same way you came.’ ”\nAlvarado did not speak during the hearing.\nShe earlier pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. After she led the victim to other gang members, according to prosecutors and court records, she stepped back, shouted encouragement and laughed.\n“Even after the murder,” Assistant State’s Attorney Robert Hill wrote in court records, “Ms. Alvarado showed so little regard for the life of her victim that she came back to the crime scene to show her friends the gang’s handiwork.”\nNeither Tuesday’s hearing nor court filings explained how Alvarado became involved in MS-13. In court, her attorney suggested that other gang members manipulated her.\n“They used her,” Timothy E. Clarke said. “I think the evidence would be that they used her to get to this person.”\nThe oldest of six children, Alvarado left school in the ninth grade. She has two children and has worked at a sandwich shop and for a company that cleans apartments, according to Clarke. She also used cocaine and marijuana “to a significant extent,” according to Clarke, a problem that led to her one previous arrest, on a charge of drug possession.\nClarke sought a prison term of 25 years — to give her more hope for life after her release. “Everything would suggest that she can be a very valid member of our community,” Clarke said, “and be a participant in her children’s lives.”\nFour others were charged in the killing. The youngest, Juan Gutierrez-Vasquez, who was 16 at the time of the death and was charged as an adult, pleaded guilty this month and awaits sentencing. Trials are pending in Montgomery for Jose Coreas-Ventura and Josue Cuadra-Quintanilla. An attorney for Coreas-Ventura could not be reached. Ron Earnest, an attorney for Cuadra-Quintanilla, said his client is not guilty.\nThe Montgomery case against Oscar Delgado-Perez was dropped. Federal prosecutors charged him with immigration violations, to which he pleaded guilty, according to court records. They also charged him with conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise, according to court records. That case is pending. One of his attorneys, Alfred Guillaume, declined to comment.\nFor the family and friends of Villagran Morales, the extreme violence of his death has made it that much more haunting. Four people close to him began a search when they couldn’t reach him for a day and now live with images of his rain-soaked body, which they found in the park before calling police.\nVillagran Morales was born in a region of Guatemala near the Honduran border. His mother and father migrated to the United States, leaving him in the care of his grandmother. He eventually came north himself, said his mother, Morales.\n“At least bringing him here, nothing will happen to him,” she recalled telling her mother. “He’ll study and work and be safe.”\nHe crossed the border, made his way to his father’s home in Maryland, lived there and then moved in with his mother in New Jersey, Morales and other relatives said. He went to school for a while but was more interested in working and got a job on a landscaping crew.\n“He always asked if I wanted to go back to Guatemala,” his mother said. “He said he wanted to work here for seven or eight years, make some money and then go back to Guatemala. He wanted to build a house, have a little farm.”\nOutside of his job, Villagran Morales liked to work on cars, buy toys for his brother and play soccer. In early 2016, after turning 18, he told his mother that he wanted to move to Maryland, where he had lined up a landscaping job that paid $1 more per hour. “I didn’t want him to go, but he said it would only be for a short while,” his mother said.\nShe drove him to Maryland in April 2016, and he moved in with a cousin.\nVillagran Morales generally left for his landscaping job at 7 a.m., returned 12 hours later and often bicycled to a nearby store to buy juice or candy. It was at the store, his family thinks, that he met Alvarado.\nWithin days, he ran into Gutierrez-Vasquez, Cuadra-Quintanilla and Coreas-Ventura, according to prosecutors. The three asked whether he was a member of a gang.\nOne of the suspects later told police that Villagran Morales had said he was a gang member but that Villagran Morales wouldn’t say which gang.\n“Why he said that, we don’t know,” Hill, the prosecutor, said in court Tuesday. “He was 18 — maybe he wanted to look cool in front of the other individuals. But he said he was. He wasn’t. He was never a member of any gang.”\nThe three others, who told Villagran Morales they weren’t gang members, persisted, according to court records. They asked him whether he knew how to demonstrate hand signals, records show.\n“He threw out some gang signs — maybe that he had seen or had learned or something,” Hill said. “But they were not for MS-13. They were for 18th Street, which is the rival gang of MS-13.”\nNone of the three — who were all members of MS-13, according to Hill — said anything.\nBut later, at an apartment, they called the leader of their gang “clique,” according to Hill, and told him they had come across a rival. The call was placed on speaker.\n“Why didn’t you kill him?” the leader asked, demanding that they do so, according to Hill.\n“They said, ‘We’ll kill him,’ ” the others responded, according to Hill. “We’ll kill him. We’ll work it out. We’ll get it done tomorrow.”\nThe gang members, he said, put in motion the plan to have Alvarado draw Villagran Morales to Malcolm King Park with the promise of sex.\nAlthough he was only about 5-foot-2, Villagran Morales was powerfully strong from weightlifting. He fought off his attackers, until their numbers overwhelmed him as he begged for his life, court filings show.\nWhen he didn’t return later that night or the next day, his family members and friends grew worried. They couldn’t reach him on his phone, began calling hospitals and went to search the park.\nJennifer Torres, who dates one of Villagran Morales’s cousins, said she was one of four people who went to the woods to try to find him last summer.\n“Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something,” Torres recalled outside court. “And then I saw his legs and his shirt, and I told them: ‘I think that’s him. He’s there.’ ”\nShe said: “He was an amazing young man full of life and joy. We hope this case brings light to the horrific things these gangs do.”\nThe teenager was buried in a cemetery near his mother’s home in New Jersey. That is one small comfort, Morales said.\nHer son could be among the MS-13 victims buried in woods, their bodies never found, their parents never certain what happened.\n“Some mothers,” she said, “don’t even know that their kids have been killed.”"},{"url":"https://www.citylab.com/navigator/2017/05/the-disconnected-commute/528351","title":"The Zen of Biking to Work","author_text":"Adam Sneed","keywords":[],"publication_text":"CityLab","description":"The best thing about biking to work has nothing to do with exercise, the environment, or saving money. It’s all about the chance to unplug.","date":"","full_text":"Since moving to Washington, D.C., six years ago, there’s one question I know I’ll hear when I go home to sprawling suburban Phoenix: “So, you don’t have a car?”\nFor five years, I commuted almost exclusively by metro. More times than I can count, when I’ve said this to friends and family back home, they’d respond with some comment about how nice it must be to get some work done on my way into the office.\nBike Week\nGo\nSure, when I need to field some emails while standing on the train, it is nice. Mostly, though, I spend that time mainlining media: shuffling through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Spotify, and more or less All The News. My former life as a car commuter was great for listening to music; this new one was perfect for the golden age of connectivity. But then I fell in love with its exact opposite: a mode of transportation that wouldn’t allow me to do anything but commute.\nI finally committed to becoming a bike commuter when the D.C. metro hit rock bottom last year. I told myself I was doing it for the normal reasons: it’s healthier, cheaper, and greener. I’m also lucky to have decent cycling infrastructure in my neighborhood, so why not use it?\nThese were compelling enough reasons to test the waters. I fixed up my bike, took a deep breath, and prepared for battle with every driver on the road. Deep down, I thought I would revert back—to the path of least resistance—soon enough. For a while, a powerful voice in my head would say that I wasn’t prepared to sweat this morning, or I didn’t have it in me to carry the bike down to the street, or, yeah, I’d rather just do some work on my way to work.\nFor 30 whole minutes, my brain would be blissfully free from the demands of glowing rectangles perfectly optimized to lure me in and jam my face with #content.\nBefore I realized it, though, it became the best part of my morning routine. Without thinking, I’d grab my helmet, lug my bike down the 10 steps that once seemed insurmountable, and ride away. More than anything, I was drawn to the fact that, for 30 whole minutes, my brain would be blissfully free from the demands of glowing rectangles perfectly optimized to lure me in and jam my face with #content.\nThink about the last time you spent half a waking hour without a ding, or a buzz, or a voice in your ear. In the attention economy, this constant distraction has become perfectly normal. Last year, Microsoft researchers found that the average human attention span has fallen to just eight seconds, meaning we’re apparently more distractible than goldfish (at least until they get their own iPhones). According to The Atlantic, “one team of psychologists discovered that two-thirds of men and a quarter of women would rather self-administer electric shocks than sit alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes.” It may sound crazy, but you get it, right?\nAt first, I felt this anxiety, too. I’d imagine phantom buzzes in my pocket and check to make sure I didn’t miss an email before the light turned green. I considered getting a smartwatch as a handy way to keep up with notifications on my commute. And then it hit me: Just ignore the damn thing! When I did, I caught my mind wandering, and—it’s almost embarrassing to admit—had to fight the urge to cut it off with a quick hit of lit pixel. It was an exercise in its own right, and a difficult one. But I’ve since figured out how to be a refreshing mix of bored, contemplative, and daydreamy for those 30 minutes on both ends of the workday, and I can’t recommend it enough for anyone who thinks that sounds like a nightmare.\nRelated Stories\nSmartphone addiction is real not only because it’s engineered that way, but because it’s easy. Whether you’re walking down the street, boarding the subway, or waiting for the bus, why not take a second to text a friend?

Slate’s Torie Bosch has written about fighting to keep the shower as the last media-free zone. I would add that the bike, if you work for it, provides the last media-free commute.\nSure, it’s possible to stay glued to your phone on a bike, but you have to be intentional about it. (My colleague Andrew Small makes the case for biking with a boombox, for example.) You also have to understand when you’re ceding some amount of personal safety for the sake of keeping your headphones on. People can (and do) debate if that’s actually unsafe. Either way, I say it cancels out the best benefit of cycling.\nPerhaps Talking Heads frontman David Byrne said it best in his rumination on cycling in The Guardian: “Cycling can be lonely, but in a good way.

Republican businessman Greg Gianforte appeared to be headed for a likely victory in the race against another political newcomer, musician and Democrat Rob Quist.\nThen came Wednesday night.\nAs most people seem to now know, Gianforte lashed out at Ben Jacobs of the Guardian when the reporter pressed him for his stand on the House Republican health care proposal. Jacobs’ phone was recording audio that has since ricocheted around the internet.\nWithin 24 hours nearly one million people had watched the YouTube video posted of the audio – a total about equal to the entire population of Montana.\nThe result was a firestorm of media coverage and social media bile. And yet Thursday night Montana elected the millionaire software entrepreneur and the nation was left to ask: Why?\nWell, as a former political reporter and someone who wrote an encyclopedia about the media and politics (and, yes, I didn’t know people did that, either), I will try to explain what happened under the Big Sky.\nVoting early often\nKey to the Gianforte win is one simple fact: The incident came after some 250,000 Montanans had already cast ballots in the race. That means 69 percent of voters ended up casting their ballots before the assault. In fact, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock had pressed for the entire vote to be done by mail, in an effort to reduce costs and potentially increase voter turnout.\nRepublicans, led by the state party chairman and legislator Jeff Essmann, fought the measure and in the end, the state opened polling places on Thursday. This created the opportunity for voters to weigh in on Gianforte’s behavior.\nOne of the big questions was: Had too many people already cast their ballots? Unlike some states, Montana does not allow people to change their minds or retract their votes after they are cast. So as the ballots were being counted, people were asking: Did Gianforte have enough of an early voting lead to fight off any voter anger over the assault?\nSome indications ahead of the vote gave Republicans reasons to be worried. A week before Election Day, the Billings Gazette reported on the anemic rate of return in the race. Reporter Tom Lutey noted that only 31 percent of the registered voters had cast ballots and that most officials were reporting continued light turnout with people turning in the absentee ballots. Although Montana does not have formal early voting, voters can drop off their absentee ballots in person ahead of Election Day.\nThat news made the question of turnout the great decider in this race. And in the end, not enough Montanans cast ballots in opposition to Gianforte, and the Republican eked out an 7-point victory.\nThe victory – coming in at less than half the margin garnered by former Congressman Ryan Zinke only six months ago – was closer than most people had projected a week earlier.\nGianforte entered this race with a lot of wind at his back. He had just run an expensive campaign for governor where he nearly knocked off the incumbent. He spent more than US$5 million of his own money in that race, and when the GOP met to select a nominee for the special election, he could boast more than 80 percent name recognition. He was an experienced campaigner.\nHe was also competing for a seat Democrats had failed to make a serious run at in 20 years.\nBut even before the assault, a couple of wild cards threw the politics of Big Sky Country into doubt. Democrats picked a banjo-playing everyman, and health care became a central issue.\nEnter the banjo\nIn all the sturm und drang of the past 24 hours, one of the names that only occasionally cropped up was Rob Quist, the Democrat running against Gianforte. Quist grew up in rural Montana and became a homegrown star as one of the leaders of the Mission Mountain Wood Band, a country rock group started in the 1970s. Always clad in a white cowboy hat and sporting a mustache, Quist stressed his Montana roots and argued Gianforte, who was born in New Jersey, was not “one of us.”\nMontana Public Radio’s Eric Whitney quoted one Bozeman supporter as saying, “I think he’s perfect because he’s a native Montanan. He came from an agriculture background. I think he’s qualified because he’s a middle-income person, he’s not a millionaire.”\nQuist’s campaign drew in a lot of support, raising more than $5 million, but also faced an onslaught of outside money. The Center for Responsive Politics reported that Republican-aligned groups like the Congressional Leadership Fund, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican National Committee were the top outside spenders, doling out more than $4.7 million in independent expenditures as of a week ago.\nQuist, who had to fight stories about failing to pay contractors and tax liens, as well as questions about his support of gun rights, seemed to weather the ads fairly well.\nMontana, interestingly, has somewhat of a track record in turning against candidates who receive outside help. In both 2016 and 2014, there have been high-profile Montana Supreme Court races where groups have poured money into attacks on one candidate only to see that candidate turn the spending into an effective argument against their opponent.\nQuist had some success playing the same card, seeking to connect it to the message that Greg Gianforte is an outsider.\nAn actual issue?\nThe last piece of the puzzle, and the one that triggered the now-infamous assault, was the emergence of health care as a major issue in this campaign.\nIn 2015, a bipartisan group in the Republican-led Montana legislature worked with the Democratic governor to pass a Medicaid expansion bill. The decision provided 70,000 Montanans – about 7 percent of the state – with health insurance. In a big, sparsely populated state like Montana, rural hospitals and clinics soon found that the coverage helped keep their lights on and provided needed money for services.\nThe American Health Care Act threatened all of that. Quist’s campaign used it to produce a highly effective one-minute ad that ran all over the state.\nThe ad put Gianforte on the spot. The Republican had publicly hedged about the plan, saying he wanted to see the full Congressional Budget Office report on the proposal. He was also caught on tape telling donors he was “thankful” for the GOP bill.\nIt was that dispute that prompted Ben Jacobs to push Gianforte to finally answer the question one way or another.\nThe rest is history.\nNow, Gianforte takes office a deeply scarred politician. He faces a court date in June and has to somehow rebuild a reputation badly tarnished by a 30-second outburst."},{"url":"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/boston-test-all-door-boarding-bus-silver-line","title":"Boston Begins Test of All-Door Boarding on Bus Line","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"The pilot program will run through June 6. ","date":"","full_text":"On Wednesday, Boston bus riders got a chance to start trying all-door boarding along parts of the Silver Line.\nA pilot program on several routes between Dudley Square and downtown runs until June 6 and is the result of a partnership with the city, Boston BRT and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).\nAccording to a release, the routes boast some of MBTA’s highest ridership numbers, carrying about 14,000 passengers on an average weekday:\nTwo-thirds of the delay on the SL4 and SL5 comes from the amount of time it takes for riders to get on and off the bus. Riders currently only board through the front door, in a single file line, paying as they get on the bus. The time it takes each person to pay (using Charlie Cards, Charlie Tickets, dollar bills, or coins) creates wait time at each stop that adds up over the course of a ride. The Silver Line Better Bus Experience will test all-door boarding as a proxy for the off-board fare collection process that makes BRT boarding and exiting work like a subway train.\nThe buses will also experiment with dedicated lanes and transit signal priority, which is “intended to minimize the time buses spend stopped for red lights,” according to local ABC station WCVB.\n“During the demonstration, volunteers will survey riders to gather information about how the changes affect the commuter experience,” the station reports.\nBeyond Boston, all-door boarding is seen by many transit experts as a way to boost bus ridership, which is declining in some of America’s largest cities.\n“Buses have become less reliable and slower over the years,” Alex Engel, National Association City Transportation Officials (NACTO) senior program associate, told Next City contributor Josh Cohen in February. “It’s partly because traffic has increased. But one of the main things we identified was boarding time. One-third of a bus’s time on route is spent waiting for people to board. A lot of that is fare collection.”\nAccording to a report released by NACTO and TransitCenter, “bus operators in the U.S. spend a cumulative six million hours waiting at bus stops each year, which in turn costs agencies an estimated $700 million,” Cohen reported. “The delays make sense. If 20 people are waiting to board a bus at a popular stop and it takes each person five to nine seconds, that adds up to over three minutes of waiting. Multiplied over a whole route, it totals to significant delay.”\nRachel Dovey is an award-winning freelance writer and former USC Annenberg fellow living at the northern tip of California’s Bay Area.

It is equally critical that the citizens of Jackson engage with such reporting.","date":"","full_text":"Last month, I read Donna Ladd's article about violence, gangs, policing, teens, education, drugs and poverty in Jackson (\"A Hunger to Live: The Struggle to Interrupt the Cycle of Violence in Jackson\", April 20, 2016, posted at jfp.ms/preventingviolence).\nRegardless of your thoughts about crime in the City, I strongly encourage you to take the time to read the article. It is the most in-depth policy piece anyone has done on crime, poverty and ideas for dealing with crime (other than \"lock 'em up, throw away the keys\") in Jackson for quite some time.\n\"When is the City going to get serious about crime?\" outstrips even \"When are you going to fix that pothole?\" as the most common question I receive as a city councilperson. From social media sites like nextdoor.com to neighborhood forums in the Queens and Presidential Hills, it's clear that the people of Jackson desperately want to see a reduction in crime.\nBecause the people of Jackson are so frustrated at the moment about crime, it is tempting for us as civic leaders to do something, anything, regardless of its actually efficacy. At the same time, if an approach to crime can't be condensed to look good on a push card or a social media site, it's hard for us to create the space to consider or advocate for innovative approaches to reducing crime.\nGiven those realities, it's critical for the City of Jackson to have solid coverage of our efforts to try new approaches at crime reduction. It is equally critical that the citizens of Jackson engage with such reporting.\nMs. Ladd's recent article is, to my knowledge, the only reporting that covers what happened with the Metro Area Crime Elimination program that received so much coverage last year. Her exploration of how this attempt to reduce crime played out in practice is significant. As Ms. Ladd noted, \"Mayor Yarber was straightforward that the program wasn't executed as it was designed to be, even after his administration and others made a 'grand announcement' about the program's potential.\"\n\"Well, I think a couple of real important pieces were missing,\" Yarber told the JFP. That included \"social development after we went in and cleaned up the neighborhoods.\" That is, the carrot. In addition, he said, \"We didn't do as good a job as we should have on data collection.\"\nThe evaluation of that program was appreciated. Yet, what I appreciated even more in Ms. Ladd's article was her attention to Mr. John Knight. Quoting Mayor Yarber, \"If you lived in Jackson growing up ... you knew John Knight's name. He and his crew ran the streets.\" Mr. Knight spoke during public comments a few weeks ago at a city council meeting and made an impassioned plea to the mayor and council to work collaboratively with him to fight crime.\nThe idea of working with a former drug dealer to prevent violence turns the usual conceptions about crime fighting on their heads. Perhaps, however, we should join Ms. Ladd and Mayor Yarber in considering whether Mr. Knight and men and women like him can be effective in combating violence in the City after causing so much of it. With regards to Mr. Knight, Ms. Ladd quotes Dr. Gary Slutkin, a medical doctor and epidemiology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago Public School of Health. Dr. Slutkin has championed an epidemiological/public-health approach to violence prevention called Cure Violence (cureviolence.org). Dr. Slutkin notes that \"it sounds like the city is missing the structure around (Mr. Knight), and enough of him.\" Ms. Ladd reports that the mayor is more guarded, saying he is \"not sure how to use (Mr. Knight) just yet.\"\nLike Mayor Yarber, I can't say yet whether Mr. Knight is the genuine deal. I do know, however, that working with him or people with a similar background is not a crazy idea. Richmond, Calif., for example, has been hiring people like Mr. Knight for \"Peacemaker Fellowships\" via an \"Office of Neighborhood Safety.\" Cities around the country have implemented or are evaluating similar programs.\nWhat happened with the Capitol Complex Bill shows the extent to which Jackson's crime issues supersede and impact even our infrastructure woes. We're at a point where everything should be on the table if it's effective. We need to try new things, plain and simple. To do that, we need to be able to see what other places are doing.\nAt the same time, when we do try new things like MACE, we need to know what happened and if these new methods were effective and implemented as promised (or not). Simply put, we need to be pragmatic, experimental and accountable. Ms. Ladd's article touches on all of those themes while at the same time putting a human face on kids we so readily dismiss as \"thugs.\" You genuinely should spend the time to read her whole article, and I look forward to the publication of any follow-up coverage.\nRead and comment on the article and several follow-ups at jfp.ms/preventingviolence.

Farther south, past a remote Israeli drone base, nestled atop a craggy slope across the valley below is a training base for the Islamic State, which is making new inroads far from its capital of Raqqa, more than 300 miles across the desert.\n“If going north or west is not an option,” explained one Israel Defense Force official, pointing toward the small ISIS training camp situated through a thatch of trees where southern Syria juts between Israel and Jordan, “they are going to go somewhere else.”\n“Some are already coming here. And Jordan is very concerned about the Islamic State.”\nMy trip came several weeks before Trump was due to arrive in Israel on a maiden foreign trip that is focused heavily on the Islamic State, which he has vowed to “demolish and destroy.” But the assessment he receives from a close U.S. ally that has confronted Islamic militants for generations—and recently uncovered critical intelligence about an ISIS plot to use laptops to blow up airplanes—may not be what he wants to hear.\nIn the view of the Israeli military and intelligence units I visited over several days in late April, the U.S. strategy in Iraq and Syria may be making the situation only worse. We’re radicalizing the local population and spreading the hardest-core militants to sow havoc in neighboring Lebanon—which the officers I spoke with fear may already be on the verge on collapse—and Jordan. Still others are escaping the onslaught to Europe and possibly America.\n“I am not sure it will be easy to defeat ISIS, as you are claiming to do,” Army Brig. Gen. Ram Yavne, the head of the IDF’s Strategic Division, told me in Tel Aviv, expressing a level of puzzlement shared by a number of other top commanders about the U.S. military obsession with a group that they do not consider a major strategic threat.\nSeveral officials pointed out that even the largest estimates of the number of ISIS’s fiercest adherents are on par with Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls the Gaza Strip.\nBut Trump sees it differently. He has authorized his military commanders to step up U.S. military involvement in both Iraq and Syria, including granting the Pentagon more authority to go after ISIS targets and to insert hundreds of additional American forces into Syria. As recently as Friday, Secretary of Defense James Mattis vowed to “destroy” ISIS, first by taking Raqqa and then supporting the campaign by local Arab and Kurdish forces to clear other Syrian cities along the Euphrates River, where the group has a significant presence. “We’re there to drive ISIS to its knees,” he told reporters, saying the more aggressive U.S. strategy seeks the group’s “annihilation.”\nBut some Israeli commanders, who agreed to share their assessments of the Syria conflict on the condition they not be identified, went as far as saying that the American actions in Syria and Iraq, where U.S.-backed Iraqi forces recently liberated the city of Mosul, could be turning ISIS and its affiliates elsewhere in the region into an even bigger threat to the West.\n“The worst is yet to come,” one intelligence official said.\nSeveral stressed that unlike Al Qaeda, another Sunni terrorist group that attacked the United States on 9/11, the Islamic State predicated itself not on attacking the West but revolutionizing Islam in its most rigid, violent form.\n“What ISIS has been saying since the beginning—the concept of the caliphate—was ‘we need to put our house in order first and then we have time to fight’ the outside powers,” an intelligence officer at the IDF’s Northern Command base, outside the city of Safed, told me as he pored over a map of the Syrian frontier. He believes the United States has failed to understand the competing interests and constantly shifting alliances among what the IDF estimates are between 400 and 500 different groups fighting in the Syrian civil war—including underestimating the level of local support ISIS actually has.\n“Take Mosul, for example. Mosul is a million-citizen city and the largest estimate said [there were] 8,000 militants. You can’t control a million-people city with 8,000 people if you don’t have some support within the population.”\nIn eastern Syria, where ISIS is believed to be strongest, “the population is relatively favorable to the Islamic cause—the tribes and so forth,” he added. “When you bring a Western logic into an eastern Arab mentality it doesn’t usually work out. A Western mind doesn’t really understand the nuances of Arab tribal society anywhere in the Middle East.”\nDuring the campaign, Trump promised to “bomb the shit out of ISIS.” But the American-led military campaign against the group—like the brutal attacks committed by Assad’s forces and its Russian military allies—may simply be radicalizing a new generation of terrorists bent on attacking Western countries.\n“The bombing sometimes is causing more damage than it helps,” the military intelligence officer said. “You are also perceived as one of those guys blowing things up.”\nThe U.S. may live to regret it.\n“ISIS is much like cancer,” the intelligence officer at the IDF's Northern Command said. “It is easy to cut the tumors off. But how do you prevent the small cancer cells from expanding? I think the caliphate is already thinking, ‘OK, what are we going to do next?’ What was ISIS doing the minute the Americans and Iraqis went into Mosul? It started exploding everything up in Iraq—about 1,000 suicide attacks in a number of months. Raqqa is probably going to fall. The same thing will happen. All the cancerous cells throughout Syria ... are going to do the same and start blowing things up.”\nThe United States has mishandled the situation in other ways, in the view of the Israelis I spoke with. For example, U.S. efforts to train rebel fighters inside Syria to fight ISIS are widely seen as counterproductive. “The CIA [training] program goes against Assad and the Pentagon program only goes for rebels against ISIS,” the intelligence officer complained. “So what is the U.S. stance is not really clear here.”\nIsraeli analysts laid out several possible scenarios ahead for the Syrian civil war, including that Assad regains control of his country (not likely) and the regime grants some rebels group autonomy and economic incentives in return for coexistence (already well underway).\nWhat they agree on is that Assad is now unquestionably winning. And he owes Hezbollah, the radical Shia Muslim proxy of Iran, “big time” for it.\nThe so-called Army of God, which has gone to war with Israel twice and constitutes a state within a state in neighboring Lebanon, has lost an estimated 1,700 fighters bleeding for the Syrian dictator and as payback is now seeking to expand its new base of operations in Syria—which also means a new sphere of influence for the mullahs in Tehran.\n“If Assad wins,” one IDF official in the Golan Heights told me, “we will have Hezbollah on two borders not one.”\nYavne, the brigadier general, similarly described the Iranian influence as significantly more worrisome than ISIS or other Sunni Muslim terror groups:\n“If I can be frank, the radical axis headed by Iran is more risky than the global jihad one,\" said Yavne. “It is much more knowledgeable, stronger, with a bigger arsenal.”\nAs far as these Israeli officers are concerned, the ideal strategy is to sit back and let both types of groups duke it out—and work to contain the conflict rather than trying to end it with military force. As the IDF intelligence officer put it, “the battle for deterrence is easier than the battle for influence.”\nBut does that mean the United States and its allies should simply allow ISIS to retain its so-called caliphate in parts of eastern Syria and eastern Iraq?\n“Why not?” the officer shot back. “When they asked the late [Israeli] Prime Minister Menachem Begin in the Iraq-Iran War in the 80s, who does Israel stand for, Iraq or Iran, he said, ‘I wish luck to both parties. They can go at it, killing each other.’ The same thing is here. You have ISIS killing Al Qaeda by the thousands, Al Qaeda killing ISIS by the thousands. And they are both killing Hezbollah and Assad.”\nI asked an IDF official peering out into the Syrian frontier a similar question—about the consequences of America’s war against ISIS in the region.\n“There is no lack of Islamic militant groups here,” he said, clutching a machine gun in one hand and a pineapple popsicle in another. “You just haven’t heard of them yet.”"},{"url":"https://www.devex.com/news/how-to-engage-silicon-valley-in-global-development-89086","title":"How to engage Silicon Valley in global development","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Devex","description":"Silicon Valley representatives of U.S. government agencies have been meeting regularly since a daylong retreat at the home of Todd Park, the former U.S. chief technology officer.","date":"2017-01-03","full_text":"Silicon Valley representatives of U.S. government agencies have been meeting regularly since a daylong retreat at the home of Todd Park, the former U.S. chief technology officer.\n“Even though we have vastly different portfolios, people in Silicon Valley see us all as ‘the government,’ so we need to have some level of coordination amongst ourselves,” Zvika Krieger, the State Department representative to Silicon Valley, told Devex.\nLast month, President-elect Donald Trump gathered tech leaders for an intimate summit in New York City, but it remains to be seen what his presidency will mean for U.S. government engagement with Silicon Valley, which has been a priority for U.S. President Barack Obama.\nIn the meantime, beyond the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, both of which have invested in Silicon Valley engagement, other nongovernmental organizations working on international development, global health, and humanitarian response are increasingly sending representatives to the West Coast.\nDevex recently caught up with a number of Silicon Valley liaisons to gather advice for organizations looking to direct the attention of leaders in this tech and innovation hub toward global problems that could benefit from their dollars and ideas.\n1. Consider ways to engage.\nThere are a few different models to build a bridge to Silicon Valley, from launching an entire local office, as the Department of Defense has done, to sending representatives on frequent trips, the strategy favored by the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation.\n“You have to think out of the box and in terms of what is scalable, and if it is scalable, you really have to have a big play in mind,” said Christian Merz, senior program officer for digital solutions in the agricultural development program at the Gates Foundation.\nBased in Seattle, he travels to San Francisco often. As he explores applications of information and communications technologies for smallholder farmers in rural areas, he said he has prioritized opportunities that serve the business interests of companies.\nSilicon Valley operates on informal relationships, and basing people in the Bay Area helps U.S. governmental agencies, or nongovernmental organizations, coordinate their priorities and approaches, said Eric Daimler, White House Presidential Innovation Fellow at the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\"The people not acquainted with technology, who are not in this space, will think the easy things are hard and the hard things are easy,” said Daimler, who focuses mainly on artificial intelligence and robotics. “They will get those backwards or mix those up.”\nMore than a dozen U.S. government agencies have opened Silicon Valley offices, and each of them are taking different approaches, learning from each other along the way. The DoD has gone through a reboot of Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, after it failed to gain traction the first time around. Meanwhile, other agencies are sending a single representative to build relationships with the technology and innovation sector, a move some celebrate and others criticize.\n“Putting one person there and thinking that is going to solve the problem is different from deciding you’re going to live there, put a stake in the ground, and build an operation,” said Maura O’Neill, the former chief innovation officer at USAID, who was a proponent of basing USAID’s Global Development Lab in the Bay Area rather than in Washington, D.C.\n2. Build a rolodex.\nRead related stories:\nThe 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit convened entrepreneurs from around the world, founders and investors from Silicon Valley, and U.S. government representatives, including Obama himself.\nDanielle Cass, the tech sector liaison for USAID’s Global Development Lab, was one of the key organizers of the event, which focused on how to support entrepreneurs to tackle some of the world’s greatest challenges, no matter where they are based.\n\"My first year, I put 5,000 miles on my car and had five meetings a day, and that's how I got that great rolodex of contacts out here to engage the tech sector in global development,” Cass told Devex.\nGetting the big names such as Uber founder Travis Kalanick, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman on the stage, and mobilizing $315 million in capital from the private sector to support emerging market entrepreneurship, was a return on investment in relationship building, she said.\nCass is mostly focused on Silicon Valley engagement in support of Power Africa’s Beyond the Grid effort, Feed the Future, and global entrepreneurship. For example, she’s leading USAID’s partnership with the venture capital fund and accelerator 500 Startups for its upcoming Geeks on a Plane tour to Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa. Since building up her rolodex, Cass is now opening it up, offering introductions when they makes sense to the growing number of liaisons tasked with building global development partnerships in Silicon Valley.\n3. Define your challenge and value add.\n“People here don’t want to build the next burrito delivery app,” Krieger told Devex.\nHe used this line, his favorite way to describe how members of the technology and innovation want to take on more complex problems than those that have defined their day jobs, in a recent meeting at the Google campus in Mountain View. It turns out Project Wing, a unit of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc., had just launched a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill, meaning that burritos are in fact the focus of the most extensive U.S. test yet of routine drone delivery of products. But Alphabet Inc. is also behind technologies that could be game changers for global development, which is why the State Department partnered with X, its research and development facility, for its Clean Energy Access Tech Challenge at the University of California, Berkeley in September.\n“People here don’t like to just chat,” Krieger continued. “They don’t like to just sit back and pontificate on global trends.”\nHis three main missions in Silicon Valley are to explore how emerging technology will impact foreign policy issues, to involve the technology and innovation sector in responses to global challenges, and to ensure that visitors schedule meetings that matter, make clear asks, and follow up. At Hacking for Diplomacy, a course he teaches at Stanford University, he explains to students that the State Department can offer credibility to startups aiming to distinguish themselves, workforce engagement to organizations competing for talent, and new users to companies trying to get their products to market.\nU.S. government agencies and nongovernmental organizations alike need to consider what value they can add and define what their needs are, said Melissa Ho, managing director of the Silicon Valley office at the Department of Homeland Security.\n“Being more transparent and open about challenges we face has been extremely valuable to the startup community because they don’t know how to help us if they don’t understand that,” she said. “They said, ‘Talk to us in terms of problem sets and use cases.’”\nOften, when people in Silicon Valley hear the word development, what comes to mind is software development, or perhaps fundraising, but not global poverty. What is critical is to translate in terms that appeal. When Silicon Valley liaisons discuss the Sustainable Development Goals, they find their audience tends to view issues like renewable energy or financial inclusion not as a foreign aid problem, but as an investment opportunity.\n4. Identify ways to solve problems in partnership.\nWhen walking into meetings with technology companies such as Planet Labs or venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Cass always frames the conversation as: “This is the problem. You guys are experts at this. How can we work together to solve for this?”\nBy exploring these opportunities with an open mind, Silicon Valley liaisons can consider technology solutions that might not seem to be suited for the population they aim to serve. Then comes the hard work of figuring out how to adapt and customize those solutions so they are affordable, appropriate, and accessible in developing country contexts. To what extent Silicon Valley companies will work as partners in that process depends on factors like whether they view the project as corporate social responsibility or core to business.\n“Investors see the writing on the wall,” Cass said, mentioning mobile phone penetration among other global forces directing the attention of Silicon Valley to emerging markets. “What this means for the traditional global development community out here is there is more opportunity than ever to hook into that drive both from an investment point of view and from a technology point of view.”\nThe most effective meetings are those where the objective is clear, Cass said. She emphasized the need to be specific in your request, make sure the meeting does not meander, and follow through. In other words, get ready to move quickly from conversation to action.\n“The U.S. government and the global development community can move really slow,” Cass said. “But people here have [attention deficit disorder] and if you take too long they'll move on to the next thing.”\n5. Go beyond innovation tourism.\nBefore Krieger moved to San Francisco, there was a complete lack of coordination between State Department bureaus or U.S. embassies requesting meetings with Facebook or Google or Apple, he said.\n“To be honest, a lot of them have no idea why they’re coming out here,” he told Devex. “They just know something is happening out here and they want to tap into it but they don’t know why.”\nIndividuals looking to engage with Silicon Valley should first determine which problems they are trying to solve, then which companies might be the best matches given their goals, rather than reaching out to the big name companies simply because they are the most known, Krieger said.\nOrganizations would benefit to go beyond “innovation tourism,” with a packed itinerary of tours and meetings that do not amount to any real outcomes, said Eric Ries, author of “The Lean Startup.”\nHe pointed to Park, the former U.S. CTO and a tech advisor for the White House, as an example of what works in Silicon Valley engagement. Others who spoke with Devex also nodded to Park as someone who helped set Cass, Krieger, and others up for success.\n“Most people do not have the level of commitment to do the preparatory work to set up their innovation outposts and labs to succeed, in which case they’re a total waste of time,” Ries said.\nCass came into her role with little experience in the global development sector, but she was known as a tremendous networker. Her experience working as a journalist then later in technology and public policy gave her a unique combination of skills and contacts to connect people and ideas, said Aman Bhandari, who was a senior advisor to Park, and recommended Cass for the USAID tech sector liaison role. Anyone in her role must be able to tell a story and build a community in order to tackle the goal they are pursuing, in this case the mission of USAID, he said.\n“We’re still in the infancy of what technology can do vis a vis government and social impact,” Bhandari said.\nSilicon Valley liaisons are not only meeting with one another, but also sharing what they are learning, with each of them agreeing that the involvement of the technology and innovation sector in sustainable global development is needed now more than ever.\nDevex Professional Membership means access to the latest buzz, innovations, and lifestyle tips for development, health, sustainability and humanitarian professionals like you.\nOur mission is to do more good for more people.

Patterns for middle and high school teachers are similar. According the 2017 Living Wage Calculator out of MIT, a family of three to four individuals necessitates a minimum annual salary of $46,000. Teachers are taking second jobs to cover their basic living expenses, not to “enjoy the finer things in life.”\nGiven these low wages, it’s no surprise that the first bit of advice many new teachers receive is to marry a doctor or a lawyer.\nBoth this advice, to marry for security, and the extremely low salary offered in a field where 76 percent of teachers are female, demands attention in relation to gender-based inequities and social justice.\nBecause 19 percent of Arizona families have a female head of household, these low salaries contribute to a large number of children in our state living at or near poverty levels.\nWhy don’t we hear more outcry, particularly in places like Arizona where there is an acute teacher shortage and where Gov. Doug Ducey is responding to this teacher shortage by signing a bill that de-professionalizes teaching, lowering standards for teacher certification?\nDoesn’t he get it? The problem isn’t that people can’t meet the standards already in place (standards necessary to ensure that the most intelligent, skilled and caring individuals work with our kids). The problem is that people don’t want to go into a profession that requires they accept a poverty wage.\nThis is not an abstract exercise in feminist principles, but a daily battle not only for the women and men who have chosen teaching as their profession, but for their students and our communities more broadly.\nTeacher well-being translates into student well-being. If we paid teachers in Arizona what we pay lawyers, architects, IT professionals, engineers, CEOs, doctors or other highly respected, highly compensated professionals, our teachers wouldn’t have to take second jobs and might have more energy, creativity and time to invest in our community’s children.\nWe might not lose one out of two teachers within the first five years of their fledgling careers.\nAnd, according to this same report by the National Center for Education Statistics (U.S. Department of Education), this appalling attrition rate is directly influenced by starting salaries, and is even higher among teachers of color.\nIt’s certainly one of the reasons that, two and a half years ago, I left teaching to become a coordinator for refugee K-12 education in Tucson to support and train classroom teachers, to help refugee parents better understand and become advocates for their children within the U.S. school system, and to support the learning, achievement and integration of refugee and immigrant students through after-school programming.\nRaising teacher salaries is not the only step required to attract the best and brightest to the teaching profession; there are larger structural issues and concerns regarding working conditions to be addressed. But, it is a critical first step toward bringing highly qualified, motivated and diverse individuals into our classrooms.\nWhat will it take? A slight increase in property taxes? We can do that. Increase the investment by the Arizona legislature in public schools? There is support for public financing of education. Arizonans rated education as the most important issue in our state and approved Proposition 123 to increase education funding. An endowment from a bold philanthropist? We’ll accept such infusions of resources and hope. Teachers standing up for their rights and not letting themselves be coopted by their love of their students, our children? We have the power for such action.\nWe must remember that teaching is absolutely not charity work. It’s a calling. It’s a profession. It’s the heart of our democracy and the hope of our future.\nPatricia MacCorquodale, a professor of gender and women’s studies at the University of Arizona and a Tucson Public Voices Fellow with the Op-Ed Project, contributed to this article.\nJulie Kasper is a National Board Certified Teacher who works with and for K-12 refugee students and English Language Learners in Tucson, and is a Tucson Public Voices Fellow with The OpEd Project."},{"url":"http://crossroads.newsworks.org/index.php/keystone-crossroads/infrastructure/item/104328-a-tale-of-two-cities-wooden-streets-","title":null,"author_text":null,"keywords":null,"publication_text":null,"description":null,"date":"","full_text":"Cobblestone, brick, asphalt: the commonwealth has an abundance of street-paving options. But there’s one we don’t talk about a lot: wooden blocks. Both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are each home to one of the last wooden streets in the nation.\nA quick ramble through the interwebs turns up pages of stories about wooden streets. But if this story had been written 100 years ago, it likely wouldn’t merit publication. Wooden streets were about as common back then as fights over bike lanes are today.\nBetween the mid-1850’s and early 1900s, wood streets were all the rage; everybody who was anybody was hopping on the Nicolson paving train, fitting wooden blocks tightly into streets. The trend had a lot going for it. For starters, horses and carriages traveling over stone pavers and bricks made an awful lot of noise, and contributed to innumerable cases of horse shin splints. (You try pulling a cart and walking on cobbles all day). It also didn't hurt that wooden blocks were cheap.\n“Wooden streets in Pittsburgh were fairly common,” said Matthew Falcone, president of Preservation Pittsburgh, and a member of the city’s Historic Review Commission. But “as people moved toward automobiles, they just became completely irrelevant. They gradually started to disappear.”\nWith a few notable exceptions.\nOnce upon a time, Philadelphia’s S. Camac Street street was lined with granite blocks. They were ripped up and replaced with wooden blocks in 1917, and have vanquished the vagaries of weather, time, and paving trends ever since. That is, until they were covered in asphalt in 2015.\nWhy were they asphalted over? As part of the city’s Historic Street Paving Thematic District Inventory, S. Camac was restored in 1998. But the blocks started to rot, bottom up, and became a safety hazard, said Steve Lorenz, Streets Department’s chief highway engineer.\nHe expects to restore the street by 2018. But it’s a cautionary tale for the city’s other historic streets.\n“If we don’t start making the investments in them, they’re going to start to fall a part and we’re going to lose those treasures in the next 50 to 100 years.”\nIn Pittsburgh, Roslyn Place was the little street that could. It runs between two rows of homes inhabited by people stubbornly proud of their eccentric wooden blocks.\nWhen the city considered paving Roslyn Place in the 1980s, outcry was swift and persistent. The Department of Public Works completed a full restoration in 1985. Worried the street might never get that kind of love and care again, some neighbors still keep a small stash of leftover wooden blocks to make their own emergency repairs.\nThe street has been honored as an historic landmark for many years, and the city has gradually come to recognize that protecting the past protects the future, said Karamagi Rujumba, director of public communications for the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation.\n“Our renewal, really, is based in the preservation and repurposing of those places.”\nHowever, the landmark plaque hanging on a nearby iron gate was mainly an honorific, and offered no real protection. Falcone’s organization, Preservation Pittsburgh, nominated Roslyn Place for a designation that would.\nLast week, Pittsburgh City Council voted to make the street a City Historic Site, which means it can’t be paved over. At least, not without making it past several levels of public scrutiny."},{"url":"http://www.fayobserver.com/news/20170605/supreme-court-districts-violate-black-voters-rights","title":"Supreme Court ruling could help Democrats weaken GOP in N.C.","author_text":"Gary D. Robertson, The Associated Press","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Fayetteville Observer","description":"The redistricting ruling upholds a lower court finding that 28 of North Carolina's state House and Senate districts were illegally gerrymandered based on the race of their voters.\r\n","date":"","full_text":"The redistricting ruling upholds a lower court finding that 28 of North Carolina’s state House and Senate districts were illegally gerrymandered based on the race of their voters.\nRALEIGH — A U.S. Supreme Court decision issued Monday could give North Carolina Democrats better odds of winning legislative seats and helping Gov. Roy Cooper thwart the GOP’s conservative agenda.\nIn a one-sentence order, the justices upheld a lower court ruling that struck down 28 state House and Senate districts because they were illegal racial gerrymanders that violated the rights of black voters.\nThe illegal districts include state Senate District 21 in Hoke and Cumberland counties and state House Districts 42 and 43 in Cumberland County.\nVoters may have to wait nearly 18 months for the ruling to yield results, since the justices separately rejected an order by the lower court three-judge panel to hold special elections this fall in districts that must be redrawn by lawmakers. The justices wrote that the three judges should have done a better job evaluating whether moving up the schedule was warranted.\nThe lower court, “addressed the balance of equities in only the most cursory fashion,” the justices wrote in an unsigned opinion vacating the scheduling order. “We cannot have confidence that the court adequately grappled with the interests on both sides of the remedial question before us.”\nThe three-judge panel could still order new districts in time for the regular cycle of elections that would end in November 2018. While Monday’s opinion doesn’t prevent the judges from reaffirming a special election schedule this fall, the window to carry it out is small.\nIf the lower court orders new maps, districts throughout the state would have to be revised. That would affect not only the 28 illegally gerrymandered House and Senate districts, but those that border them.\nIn Cumberland County, this means that the Senate District 19, held by Republican Wesley Meredith, likely would be changed because it is intertwined with Senate District 21, held by Democrat Ben Clark. The revisions could put more partisan Democratic voters into District 19, making it harder for Meredith to win re-election.\nAlso in Cumberland County, Districts 42 and 43, held by Democrats Elmer Floyd and Marvin Lucas, would be changed, likely affecting District 44, held by Democrat Billy Richardson, and District 45, held by Republican John Szoka.\n“I’ll run in whatever district I have,” said Lucas, who is black. He disagreed when the Republican-controlled legislature moved the District 43 lines in 2011 to take in more minority voters, he said.\n“I didn’t see the need to have more minorities in my district because my mission is to represent all the people, not just a majority of minorities,” Lucas said.\nThe high court’s action Monday follows last month’s ruling in which the justices struck down two North Carolina congressional districts — the 1st in the east and the 12th in the Piedmont — because they also diminished the voting strength of black residents. The legislature already redrew its congressional boundaries in February 2016 and used them in last November’s election.\nThe legislative districts were initially drawn in 2011 when Republicans controlled the legislature, as they do now. Civil rights groups and voters challenged the districts, complaining that they packed too many black voters into some districts and made surrounding districts whiter and thus more likely to elect Republicans.\nThe maps have helped Republicans expand and retain majorities they initially won in 2010, when the GOP took control of both chambers simultaneously for the first time in 140 years. Republicans have used the advantage to cut taxes, restrict abortion and create taxpayer-funded scholarships for children to attend private schools.\nThe lower court judges unanimously declared that GOP legislators had failed to justify creating so many districts with black voting-age populations above 50 percent.\nDemocrats need to capture three House seats or six Senate seats currently held by Republicans to eliminate the GOP’s veto-proof majorities and enhance Cooper’s power. He has vetoed four bills since taking office in January, and legislators overrode all of those vetoes.\n“Whether the election is November 2018 or earlier, redrawing the districts is good for our democracy by leveling the playing field for free and fair elections,” Cooper said in a statement.\nIn previously ordering that maps be redrawn quickly and elections be held in the fall, the lower court wrote that the costs of holding special elections “pale in comparison to the injury caused by allowing citizens” to remain represented by lawmakers in gerrymandered districts.\nWith the congressional district ruling just two weeks ago, GOP lawmakers already were anticipating the legislative maps would be struck down, too. Their attorneys have complained that in requiring elections this fall, the three judges ignored state constitutional requirements for General Assembly terms and candidates living in a district for at least one year.\nHolding races earlier than November 2018 would “ignore voters’ constitutional right to elect representatives to two-year terms, and effectively nullify their votes from 2016,” Republican Rep. David Lewis and Sen. Ralph Hise said in a release Monday.\nAnita Earls, a lawyer representing voters who sued over the districts, said there’s still time to draw new district lines in time for special elections this year. The lawmakers’ attorneys have said more than 100 General Assembly districts would have to be redrawn to comply with the order.\n“Many North Carolinians have been participating in unfair elections in racially gerrymandered districts for far too long,” she said in a news release.\nRick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine professor and election law expert, wrote in a blog post that Monday’s opinion makes holding 2017 legislative elections much harder, “but it is not impossible.”\nAssociated Press writer Mark Sherman in Washington and Paul Woolverton of The Fayetteville Observer contributed to this report."},{"url":"http://www.caller.com/story/news/local/2017/06/02/flints-hills-and-koch-pipeline-award-college-scholarships/357607001","title":"Flints Hills and Koch Pipeline award college scholarships","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Corpus Christi Caller-Times","description":"Flint Hills and Koch Pipeline awarded $74,000 in scholarships to 56 South Texas high school students through their Outstanding Student Scholarship Program.","date":"","full_text":"Flint Hills Resources and Koch Pipeline Company partnered to give out scholarships to 56 South Texas high school students.\nThe students, from 27 South Texas high schools, received the scholarships through the companies' Outstanding Student Scholarship Program.\nStudents were selected based on a teacher's nomination, an essay on principled entrepreneurship, and their plans to pursue a career in the field of science, technology, engineering, or math.\nFlint Hills Resources and Koch Pipeline Company gave a total of $74,000 to South Texas students, which was part of the $129,000 in scholarships awarded to students throughout Texas."},{"url":"https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2017/malawi-killed-for-their-bones/index.html","title":"Killed for their bones","author_text":"Al Jazeera","keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"On the trail of the trade in human body parts","date":"","full_text":"Killed for their bones\nOn the trail of the trade\nin human body parts\nIn Malawi, people with albinism are being killed and their bodies harvested; children and adults hacked to death with machetes and kitchen knives.

A warm, dry day. Seventeen-year-old David Fletcher was being moody and withdrawn. He wanted to watch a football match at the local school instead of helping his family gather maize in the fields. His parents eventually relented and let him go.\nWhen he didn’t return later that day, they searched the village, but couldn’t find David.\nThe next day, they walked to the nearest police station to report him missing. Then they waited.\nA week later, the local police chief came to their home to deliver the news: David’s dismembered body had been found, 80km away, in neighbouring Mozambique. It was badly decomposed, he told them. It couldn’t be brought to the village for burial, but he could bring the arms and legs, if they wished. And if the family could afford the journey, they could visit it where it was found.\n“He was dead. What benefit was there to see his dead body?” Fletcher Machinjiri, David’s 65-year-old father, asks, dismissively. “It was too expensive for us.”\nFletcher is sitting outside his house. His 53-year-old wife, Namvaleni Lokechi, sits beside him. Her face is expressionless. Their 32-year-old daughter Mudelanji and 21-year-old son Manchinjiri sit on the hard earth a few metres away. They listen as though it is the first time they have heard the story.\n“He was killed like a goat at a market,” Lokechi says, staring into the distance. “His arms and legs had been chopped off. They broke off some of his bones. His skin was hanging. And they buried him in a shallow grave.”\nHe was killed like a goat at a market. His arms and legs had been chopped off. - Namvaleni Lokechi, the mother of David Fletcher, a murdered 17-year-old\nShe makes chopping motions with her hands as she speaks.\n“We cry every day,” Fletcher says. “To us, he was a ray of hope. We believed in his future. We thought he would lift our hand because he was good at school.”\n“We still battle to eat without him.”\n‘A war against people with albinism’\nBorn in 1999, David was the fourth of five siblings - and the only one to have been born with albinism.\n“I wasn’t surprised when he was born,” David's mother says softly. “I was more than happy with his complexion.”\nHer tiny frame stiffens when she talks about her son.\nShe had an aunt in Blantyre with the same congenital disorder that results in a partial absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes, she explains.\n“I’ve always felt that this group of people were lucky in life,” she says slowly.\nDavid was a star pupil at the local school in the neighbouring village of Kachule.\nHis teacher, Clement Gweza, recalls feeling mildly concerned when he didn’t turn up for school that Monday.\n“I thought maybe there were no groceries at home, or maybe he was unwell,” Clement says, sitting inside his empty classroom. “But the second day [he didn’t turn up] … then I got worried.”\nWhen he learned what had happened to David, he says, he was shocked. “It meant I was next,” he says, placing his hands on his chest.\nFor Clement also has albinism.\nSo, too, does 14-year-old Latida Macho, another pupil at the school. She is one of five siblings with the condition. After David’s murder, her family refused to send her to school for three weeks.\n“If this is war against people with albinism, then it means I’m second in line,” Clement reflects.\nHe says he knew that people with albinism were being murdered, but “for it to happen in the district, but also in my class, it was unreal”.\nWithin days, two men were arrested for the murder.\nBoth Malawians, they were tried in a district court in May 2016 and sentenced to 25 years in prison for conspiracy to commit a crime and abduction.\nDavid’s family say they heard about the arrests and subsequent trial only from the media. And that they are bitterly disappointed with the outcome.\n“The accused persons should be killed as well,” Fletcher says, pointing to the floor. “The child was brutally killed, hence they must equally be killed brutally.”\nAlfred’s story\nVillage of Nasi, district of Phalombe, eastern Malawi\nSeventeen-year-old Alfred Chigalu lives with his aunt in a mud home surrounded by dead sunflowers.\nTheir courtyard of red earth is home to five goats and a dozen raucous chickens.\nThe nearest neighbour is a five-minute walk away, along a path cut through overgrown grass. It takes 20 minutes - across dried up tobacco fields - to reach the main road. Drought has hit this region hard, and while tall mango trees provide shade for the farmers, they bear no fruit.\nThe climate here is harsh. Crops are often destroyed by drought or violent hailstorms. Like others in the village, Alfred and his aunt, Lydia Petulo, are surviving on pieces of dried maize from last year’s harvest. The goats in the yard are not their own. Lydia looks after them for a local merchant, and receives one at the end of each year in return.\nIn December 2015, four men broke down the door of Alfred’s bedroom while he was sleeping. They slashed at him with machetes, hitting the back of his head, his shoulders and his back. They tried to drag him out of the house. When his aunt found him in a pool of his own blood, his attackers ran away.\nAlfred survived but was left badly scarred.\nNow, the slightest sound wakes him, and when he walks to the village he must be accompanied.\n“Before the attack I used to depend on him; I could send him to the market, he could go to the farm and do the farming,” Lydia says, biting her lips as she completes her sentences.\n“But I cannot do the same these days.”\n“I fear for his life. The responsibility has shifted to me.”\nBut this isn’t the first time she has been afraid for her nephew. She took him out of school six years ago, when the taunting began, she explains.\nLydia slouches as she narrates their story. Her tired eyes wander. But they brighten when she talks about Alfred. She adopted him after his mother - her sister - died.\nAlfred had a sibling who also had albinism, but that child died, she recalls. She doesn’t remember the dates or the details - of his sibling’s or his parents’ deaths - other than that both of Alfred’s parents died around the time he took his first steps.\n‘I am lonely’\nAlfred is sitting outside on the floor, his back against the house, wearing oversized jeans and a short-sleeved shirt. They are the only clothes he owns. He was wearing his other outfit when he was attacked. There was so much blood that it had to be burned.\nOn his head is a large cowboy hat.\nHe is tall with broad shoulders that droop when he walks. For the first few hours that we are there, he doesn’t talk.\nBut when we put the camera away and move out of sight of the curious neighbours who have gathered to watch, he begins to speak.\nHis parched lips barely move.\n“I wake up at 6 in the morning, every day. I sweep the yard, but I feel pain in my arms,” he says slowly.\nHe removes his shirt to reveal long, deep scars on his chest and back.\n“The way they cut me, they cut my veins. I can barely hold a hoe,” he explains.\nI want to finish school, to become a teacher, and move out of here. I would love if someone could take me away from this village. I have to get out of this place. - Seventeen-year-old Alfred Chigalu, who was attacked in November 2015\nWhen she found him on the floor, Lydia began to scream and cry.\n“The neighbours came, but it was too late, the attackers had left,” she says. “I really felt sorry for him when I looked at him and I knew he was lucky to have survived. He would have been killed if he hadn’t screamed for me.”\nShe says she knows why he was attacked.\n“Before the attack, some people used to mock him if he went outside the house. They [would say] he is worth millions of kwacha [thousands of dollars], so that gave us an indication that his life could be in danger,” Lydia explains.\nThe physical wounds have mostly healed, but life is not the same for Alfred. He misses “chatting”, he says, shyly, before adding: “Most of all I miss my friends. I am lonely.”\nHis aunt says he “lacks peace”.\nIn April 2016, Ikponwosa Ero, the UN’s independent expert on the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism, visited Alfred and his aunt. She told Al Jazeera that Alfred seemed to have suffered “memory loss” after the attack. But when we visit him two months later, he rolls off the names of towns in Malawi, capital cities of African countries and national political leaders. He seems to be recovering.\nFiddling with a piece of dry hay, he tells us: “I want to finish school, to become a teacher, and move out of here. I would love if someone could take me away from this village. I have to get out of this place.”\nHari’s story\nVillage of Mpakati, Machinga district, southern Malawi\nEdna Cedric remembers that night in February 2016.\nHer husband, Marizane Kapiri, had gone fishing. Her identical nine-year-old twins, Hari and Harrison, were sleeping beside her.\nShe heard a knock at the door. When she answered it, a machete-wielding man barged inside, slashing at her.\nHe pulled Hari from the bed and dragged him to the door. Edna tried to hold on to him while also gripping Harrison with her other hand.\nThen the intruder struck her face with the machete and she fell to the floor. And, just like that, her son was gone.\nThe police brought the head wrapped in a cloth and in a sack. His mother identified it. - Marizane Kapiri, Hari’s stepfather\n“I couldn’t hold on to him any longer,” she says, quietly. “I ran out screaming.”\n“Four days later, the police found his head in Mozambique.”\n“The place was very lonely. This is why we moved here,” her husband says.\nThe fisherman is not the father of Edna’s children. He says he spent the best part of the five days after Hari was abducted explaining to the police why he wasn’t at home when the attack took place. They suspected that he was involved and it wasn’t until the village chief explained to them that he spent much of his time at the lake, catching fish to feed the family, that the police let him go.\n“After the police discovered the head, they sent a message to us that we should be ready to see it,” Marizane explains. “They brought the head wrapped in a cloth and in a sack. His mother identified it.”\nAccording to Amnesty International, two men were arrested in connection with Hari’s murder. One was said to be an uncle, and the other a stranger who had an existing conviction for possessing the bones of a person with albinism. For that crime, he had been fined $30.\nThe family, though, say they have no idea who was responsible for the attack and what has become of those who were arrested.\nThe twin brother\nHarrison is wearing pyjamas and a cowboy hat. He sits between his parents as they take turns to talk. He fiddles with the cords of his hat, licks his cracked lips and scratches at the dry skin on his arms. He only returned to school in September 2016, eight months after his brother was taken.\nTheir mudbrick home is in a remote rural area, far from the main road between Blantyre and Mangochi. Houses here sit in small plots on expansive fields. It is a few minutes’ walk to the nearest neighbours through fields of browning plants that haven’t been harvested in a year. Here, police officers are few and far between.\nBut this is not where Hari was taken from. That home was even more isolated, Marizane explains.\n“We demolished the house … and moved here so we are closer to other people,” he says.\nBut the move hasn’t changed much for the remaining brother, Harrison.\n“He wakes up in the middle of night, screaming, because he can’t find his brother. We just tell him he will come back one day,” Marizane explains.\nHe wakes up in the middle of night, screaming, because he can’t find his brother. - Marizane Kapiri, whose stepson, Hari, was murdered\nEdna says that she can’t get over the pain she felt when she saw Hari’s head.\n“I immediately thought about his brother, Harrison, and I knew his life would never be the same,” she says, looking at her surviving son.\nBorrowed from the word “albus”, meaning white in Latin, albinism is a congenital disorder where the body is unable to create enough melanin to darken the skin, hair and eyes.\nThe non-contagious condition affects about one in 20,000 people worldwide. But it is more common in sub-Saharan Africa, where one in 5,000 have albinism. Most cases are in Mozambique, Tanzania, Burundi, Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa.\nIn Malawi, a country of 16.5 million people, there are said to be 7,000 to 10,000 people with albinism.\nWhy it affects this part of the world so disproportionately is unclear.\nAnd it is not just a matter of colour: lack of melanin often results in poor vision and sensitivity to light. In fact, many people with albinism are legally blind.\nBecause their skin is particularly vulnerable to the sun’s ultraviolet rays, they can also be predisposed to skin cancer and lesions.\nAccording to a 2014 study, people with albinism in Africa are 1,000 times more likely to get skin cancer than others.\nBut their plight is not solely medical.\nThe story of discrimination against people with albinism is an old but not necessarily well-documented one. It is driven by myths and superstition.\nAccording to Amnesty International, those with albinism face discrimination in 23 countries in Africa.\nFor many, this discrimination amounts to violence – murder, infanticide and live burials.\nThe past decade has seen an increase in the number of documented killings and maimings of people with the condition, driven in part by a belief that their organs, bones and body parts can be sold on the black market.\nAnd that belief is fed by the myth that their bones are made of gold dust and the suggestion that they are a necessary component of magic potions.\nBut while there are reports of bones reaching up to $75,000 on the black market, there have been no documented cases of money changing hands. So the question of whether an organised trade in the body parts of people with albinism exists has yet to be definitively answered.\nThe UN’s Ikponwosa Ero says they have been unable to confirm the existence of a market.\n“There is allegedly a lot of money in this business. And I say allegedly because people keep on repeating the idea that there is a lot of money in this, and it would seem that the media is part of the reason some people have gotten involved,” she says. “But then some countries have witnessed a reduction in the number of attacks, maybe because people are realising there is no value [in the bones and body parts].”\nThe majority of the documented attacks have taken place in the Great Lakes region, particularly Tanzania and Burundi. According to media reports, Tanzania has seen some 180 attacks, including 76 murders, since 2000. Thirty-five of those murders took place in 2015.\nWithin eight months of her appointment as the UN’s independent expert on albinism in June 2015, Ikponwosa, who herself has albinism, documented 40 attacks in eight countries.\nAlthough there has long been discrimination, she points to a more recent phenomenon: “Hacking people [with albinism] alive.”\n‘Millions, millions’\nZomba, southern Malawi\nEmily Chiumia works at a government department in Zomba, southern Malawi. But she moonlights as an activist for people with albinism.\nShe’s happy to talk, even if the topic is the names they call her.\n“You walk on the street, and they call you ‘millions, millions’,” she laughs, “as if we are gold.”\nEmily is the former vice-president of the Association for Persons with Albinism (APAM). Since the attacks began, Emily and the association have been documenting the offences committed against people like her.\nMost of them, she says, are carried out by relatives, neighbours or people the victims considered to be friends.\n“Before, it was a case of people saying ‘if you sleep with a person with albinism, your skin will turn white’,” she says. “But now, it’s different. I cannot enjoy my life as I used to … I can’t walk in the evenings, can’t sleep, even at home, I fear who might come.” Her laugh has disappeared now.\nYou walk on the street, and they call you ‘millions, millions’, as if we are gold. - Emily Chiumia, former vice-president of the Association for Persons with Albinism\nRadio DJ Ian Sambota describes how in 2012 he was befriended by an “older, educated” woman who first offered him K100,000 ($138) and then K500,000 ($700) to sleep with her. “She was HIV positive and she thought if she slept with a person with albinism, it would be solved,” he says.\nIan refused, but admits that the offer was tempting because he needed the money to pay for medical care for his mother.\nSteven Burgess is in his 40s and says he has been called a “white animal” since he was a child. But this is “a time of crisis”, he explains, referring to the increase in attacks.\nBazirio Kaudzu, 46, says he feels so threatened that he only travels to the clinic in the capital Lilongwe - to collect the zinc oxide ointment needed to treat the lesions and blisters on his skin - if his nephew accompanies him. It’s an expensive journey for the tomato farmer, so each month he must take out a loan to cover the cost of the taxi ride for two.\nBut it hasn’t always been this way.\nPatricia Maguwa, 37, remembers a time when her husband, gospel singer Geoffrey Zigoma, was considered one of the golden voices of Malawian music. Before he died of cancer in 2013, he always tried to offer a counter-narrative to the misperceptions about people with albinism, she says.\n“He was called names like ‘yellow man’, but he never felt insecure about his life,” she says from her modest home 7km outside Lilongwe. “[But] the situation is different now.”\nA shifting trade\nMalawi’s government recognises that there is a problem.\nNeverson Chisiza, a senior state advocate at the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, says there have been at least 85 documented cases, including murder, assault, attempted abductions, trafficking, maiming, and grave robberies since 2014. At least 20 of those cases have been murder.\nIn May 2016, Ikponwosa Ero said that if serious action wasn’t taken to stop the attacks, people with albinism could become extinct in Malawi.\nMalawi’s government says a crackdown in neighbouring Tanzania has shifted the “trade” in body parts to their country.\nSenior Chief Kawinga, a traditional authority from Malawi’s Machinga district, where most of the attacks have taken place, told us during a visit to his office that he’d heard the market for body parts was in neighbouring Mozambique. Each country in the region tends to posit their neighbour as the source of the problem.\nThough many people tend to use the term “albino”, there have been significant attempts to change the terminology to “person with albinism”. Ikponwosa Ero says this is preferred as it puts the person before the condition, while Canadian charity Under the Same Sun points to the fact that albino has historically been used in a derogatory manner.\nIn June 2016, 150 government officials, academics and activists from 26 countries met in Dar es Salaam for the first forum on albinism in Africa. It aimed to create an action plan to end the attacks, and concluded that governments must dedicate a budget and a multisectoral task force to doing so. It recommended a range of measures and best practices. “Now that we have a catalogue of effective specific measures that are not very expensive to execute, governments should no longer act ignorant of what to do on the issue … It is time to act,” said Ikponwosa Ero.\nZomba, southern Malawi\nThe red brick walls glisten in the midday sun.\nZomba Maximum Prison stands like a citadel in the former capital. It might resemble a factory were it not for its watch towers and the metal fence that encircles it. Flanked by mango trees and shrubs, a dirt track leads to the main entrance.\nInside, some 2,365 prisoners are either awaiting trial or serving time for some of the most serious of crimes: murder, abduction, trafficking, and armed robbery.\nThe prison’s director, Major Manwell, greets us at the front door - an almost three-metre tall gateway made of green steel. He is wearing a khaki safari suit and leather sandals.\n“How can I help you?” he asks with a knowing smile.\nManwell hands us over to two prison guards who lead us into an open corridor between the front desk and the staff kitchen. A makeshift clothes line hangs nearby. We sit on a bench, shaded by the prison’s towering walls.\nOver the next three hours, we will meet eight prisoners who are either awaiting trial or have been convicted of playing some part in an attack on somebody with albinism.\nOne at a time, they sit opposite us on another wooden bench, a translator beside them.\nA guard sits at a distance - far enough that his presence doesn’t feel intrusive, but close enough to eavesdrop. His body language tells us when he finds an inmate’s story of interest. When he doesn’t, he slumps back into his leather chair.\nJust two of the inmates acknowledge that their case is related to someone with albinism. Most insist that they were framed or have been wrongly accused. Only one admits to having committed a crime.\n“They are not able to come to terms with their crimes,” says the guard, removing his cap so that he can scratch his head. “They are in denial.”\nThe tomb raider\nStenala Shaibu Lizahapa is wearing a clean white shirt and tattered jeans. He takes his seat slowly and crosses his legs. A thin row of rosary beads pass through his fingers. Stenala is not in a hurry. Unlike the others, he doesn’t fidget. He simply sits and waits.\nHe is in his mid-30s and has been convicted of trespassing on a gravesite to remove three bones from the body of a deceased man named Awali Mandevu.\nAlong with five others, he was caught trying to sell the bones to an undercover police officer in April 2015.\nAll six were charged with criminal trespassing, removal of human tissue and selling human bones.\nThree of them, including Stenala, pleaded guilty. Two others denied the charges and were acquitted, while the case against the sixth was dropped.\nStenala was sentenced to six years in prison.\nHe says he has made peace with his crime.\n“What I did was wrong, but I felt desperate,” he says softly, only briefly making eye contact. “I feel ashamed.”\nIf there is a market [for bones], I don’t know... I would have believed it if I saw it. - Stenala Shaibu Lizahapa, sentenced to six years in prison for selling human bones\nAs a fisherman, he says he was earning K500 (70 cents) a day. So when friends asked if he’d help them deliver a set of bones to a client - promising it would make him “rich enough to drive” - he says he was tempted.\n“With my income, I can’t afford a motorcycle, but a car - that was a dream … The devil took over me,” he says.\nIn early April 2015, Stenala travelled with friends from Machinga to his home district of Jali, where he went to Chinangwa, a village neighbouring his own, in search of a grave he’d been told housed the corpse of a person with albinism.\n“Who doesn’t want more money?” he asks rhetorically. “I knew it was wrong, but I did it for my family.”\n“If there is a market [for bones], I don’t know,” he says. “I would have believed it if I saw it.”\nThe victim’s family\nChinangwa village, Zomba district, southern Malawi\nIn the village of Chinangwa, Emily Emisi is sitting on a straw mat outside her mud brick and thatch-roofed home.\nShe offers us a mat on which to sit - between a couple of brown puppies and some corn drying in the winter sun.\n“Why didn’t you call before you came?” the 36-year-old asks with a smile. “I would have cooked.”\nHer generosity betrays her means. Her open yard - like the barren plateau that surrounds it - is hard brown earth. A few mango and small kachere trees surround the settlement.\nThree children sit on the floor. For a while, they watch curiously. But when the novelty of strangers wears off, they return to kicking a punctured miniature football.\n“It was my grandfather's grave that Stenala dug up,” Emily says. “It was terrible. He was buried a long time [ago], in the 1990s. And this felt like a second funeral for him.”\nEmily says it didn’t come as a surprise to many of the villagers when they learned that Stenala was responsible.\n“He was known to steal goats,” she says.\nStenala had got into an argument with his brother weeks before when he’d tried to persuade him to help find the bones, Emily explains. His brother had refused and the argument had turned into a fight. The whole village heard about it, she says.\n“Then, he tried to romance an albino girl, but the girl refused and told villagers that she was being pursued by him.”\nShe is “happy he has been put away”, she says, because he would “terrorise the village”.\nSomeone close to Stenala must have betrayed him, Emily speculates, because nobody knew that the village graveyard had been tampered with.\nBut, while she has no doubt that Stenala had been searching for the bones of somebody with albinism, Emily says he dug up the wrong grave.\n“My grandfather, Awali Madenvu, was not an albino. But his grave was close to an albino and so they got the wrong bones.”\nThat wouldn’t have made any difference anyway - the penalty in Malawi is the same.\nBecause his was not a case of murder or attempted murder, Stenala wasn’t eligible for legal aid and so had no representation in court.\nHe was tried, sentenced and given 30 days to appeal.\nWhen we tell Emily that Stenala admits his guilt and is remorseful, she clicks her tongue and looks away. “Of course, after the hardship in jail, he is going to be remorseful,” she says.\n“He is not someone who will change. We all think that his sentence is too short, and we expect him to come back and teach us a lesson.”\n‘I will wait for him’\nAs the sun is about to set, the silhouette of a woman appears through a haze of dust. She has a girl at her side and a baby in her arms.\n“That is Annie Fuleya,” a young girl says. “Stenala’s wife.”\nShe is on her way to gather wood. Stenala’s home village of Jali is just a few hundred metres away. Emily’s family crosses paths with Stenala’s every day.\nAnnie is tall with a brush-cut. She wears a long green skirt and a pale blue T-shirt.\nIn the weeks leading up to the incident, the 26-year-old says her husband was acting strangely. She recalls asking him to stay away from a friend she thought was trouble.\n“I didn’t believe it at first but then after the conviction I felt let down by him,” she reflects, looking away as she completes her sentence. Then, without looking back at us, she adds: “I believe that he did it.”\nAnnie was pregnant when her husband was arrested and must now raise their four-year-old daughter Saamyato and their now 14-month-old baby Latifa alone.\nShe left Machinga for Stenala’s village after his arrest, believing it was safer to be close to her mother-in-law. Now, she works in other people’s fields and depends on financial support from the extended family to help raise her children.\n“All I know is that he was found with body parts of an albino. I don’t know what parts. I don’t know what he did. I just feel disappointed,” Annie says, holding on to Latifa as the baby wriggles in her arms.\n“But I understand that he may have done it because of our situation. He doesn’t earn enough as a fisherman. He looks after me, his mother, my mother, and two orphaned children from an aunt,” she explains softly. “Perhaps this is what drove him to do this.”\n“I will wait for him. Because I have forgiven him,” she adds. “But he will have to conduct himself properly on his return.”\nStenala’s mother, who has been watching pensively as her daughter-in-law talks, agrees to speak to us under the shadow of a large kachere tree. Elizabeth Magawa is 49, and the resemblance to her son is immediately apparent. She smiles when we tell her this and the children who have gathered around, burst into laughter.\nElizabeth seems tired. She says she has aged over the past year.\n“I didn’t look like this,” she sighs. “I spend sleepless nights wondering why Stenala would have done such a thing. He always helped the family.”\n“It is something I will never understand,” she says. Then, she adds: “But I know he was fully capable of such a thing.”\nMaybe Stenala did it because of our poverty, or because of peer pressure. I don’t know. - Elizabeth Magawa, mother of Stenala Shaibu, sentenced to six years for selling human bones\nHer son’s arrest brought the family unwanted attention in the village, but Elizabeth says they haven’t suffered any serious repercussions.\n“There was a lot of talk. They spoke about bones. But they’ve moved on,” she says.\n“Maybe Stenala did it because of our poverty, or because of peer pressure. I don’t know.”\nIt has grown cold now and, without warning, Annie stands up and walks away, in the direction of her mother-in-law’s house.\nElizabeth watches as her daughter-in-law disappears into the darkness, her young daughter in tow.\nCharles Nyasa: Convicted of trying to sell human tissue\nCharles Nyasa cries as he tells his story.\nThe 24-year-old from Zomba district was sentenced to six years for being in possession of human flesh in March 2015.\nHe says he heard an advert for a witch doctor on radio or television - he can’t recall which - that promised “quick riches”. But when he visited the witch doctor, he was told to bring the placenta of a newborn. So, he says, he spent K8,000 ($11) buying one from nurses at a hospital.\nWhen he took it to the witch doctor, he was accused of carrying a placenta from a newborn with albinism.\nHe was convicted but insists his case had nothing to do with albinism.\nJohn Alfred: Convicted of trying to sell a child\nThirty-one-year-old John Alfred looks older than his years. He is feverish and sweating profusely, but wants to talk.\nJohn was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to sell his own child.\n“I did it because of my [financial] condition. No other reason,” he says, shaking.\nThe father of five from Naweta village, in Machinga district, was earning K4,000 ($5.50) for two weeks’ work in the gardens and on the farms of a businessman.\n“My boss saw me living in poverty and said to me one day: ‘Why don’t you be brave, and sell that child of yours?’ pointing to my daughter Vanessa. He said there were buyers in Mozambique for children like her.”\nI had five children, and I thought that maybe it wasn’t a problem to get rid of one.- John Alfred, sentenced to six years for trying to sell his daughter\nJohn says that his daughter does not have albinism but “resembled one”. The authorities at the prison say the child does have the condition, although there is no mention of it in his prison file.\n“I had five children, and I thought that maybe it wasn’t a problem to get rid of one,” John says.\nIn April 2015, without consulting his wife, he took their four-year-old daughter and left for Mozambique.\n“I didn’t know where I was going. I was just going to Mozambique to find this market,” he says.\nBut the police intercepted him in Machinga and arrested him.\n“I admitted it in court and was sentenced,” he tells us.\nMelinda Mbendera: Convicted of attempted kidnapping\nTwenty-year-old Melinda Mbendera is agitated. She twitches and bites her lips as she talks.\nShe was found guilty of trying to kidnap a child with albinism and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. But she insists that she is innocent. The court didn’t have enough evidence, she declares, and based their verdict solely on the claims of the child and her parents.\nShe says the judge told her that it would be safer for her to be in jail than on the streets, where she might face mob justice.\nIn 2016, 11 people suspected of being involved in digging graves or carrying human flesh were lynched in Malawi. In one case in the Nsanje district in March 2016, seven witch doctors accused of using bones in their potions were burned alive. A month earlier, a courthouse in the South Lunzu township in Blantyre, was razed to the ground after three people accused of murdering somebody with albinism had been bailed.\nMelinda says she previously spent eight months in prison for stealing K200,000 ($275) from a family friend. She suspects her criminal record influenced the verdict in this case.\nBut, she maintains: “I didn’t spend eight months in this wretched place only to go out and commit another crime.”\n“The police said that because I stole before, the probability was high that I did this … but why would I sell a human being?” she asks.\nZomba, southern Malawi\nEdge Kanyongolo is a tall man with thick eyebrows and an even thicker moustache.\nThe associate professor of law at the University of Malawi in Zomba is sitting behind his desk. Behind him, a window showcases a courtyard garden. Beside him, textbooks and legal reports are carefully stacked on a wooden bookshelf.\n“The attacks on persons with albinism are a manifestation of a larger problem,” he says. “On the surface, there is the question of superstition and witchcraft, but I think underlying all of that is desperation.”\nMalawi has been in an economic crisis since 2012. It began when tobacco, the country’s premier export, dropped in price by more than 50 percent in 2010. In 2012, under the guidance of the International Monetary Fund, President Joyce Banda imposed a range of hard-hitting economic reforms that were most harshly felt by the poor. The currency was devalued by almost 50 percent and inflation reached more than 20 percent.\nIn 2015, the World Bank rated Malawi as the poorest country in the world, per capita.\nTwo out of every five Malawians of employable age are without work. According to the International Labour Organisation, three in four young workers have only irregular employment, while nine out of 10 work in the informal sector, where their employment is precarious and may change daily. At least 61 percent of Malawians live on less than $1.25 a day and 2.3 million are said to be food-insecure.\n“People don’t have options to earn money. And this then drives them to be so desperate and, as some would say - so irrational - as to think that getting the body parts of a type of person and so on, may make you rich,” the professor explains.\nBut Elijah Kachikuwo, the senior deputy commissioner of police in Mangochi, disagrees. In fact, he grows agitated when questioned about the connection. He is standing in the dusty courtyard of the main police station in Mangochi.\n“It is not poverty that is causing this,” he declares, the lines on his forehead deepening. “We aren't faced with poverty for the first time in the country. We shouldn’t hide behind this … so that question is out of order.”\nThe traditional healers\nMphalare in Dedza, central region of Malawi\nMasiyambuyo Njolomole and Usmani Ibrahima Banda live in the remote village of Mphalare in Dedza. It is 80km - about an hour’s drive along a dirt track - from Lilongwe.\nThey are both traditional healers.\nSeven wooden stools lined up against a wall and a small coffee table are the only furniture inside the house where we meet them. There is no electricity, so the door has been left ajar. The sunlight illuminates the two men’s faces. A woman sweeps the yard outside, scraping at the dry earth.\nUsmani wears a skull cap; Masiyambuyo a headdress made from monkey skin. The latter smiles as he presents his registration card. Usmani’s expired in 2011.\nMasiyambuyo, a tall, thin man, makes it clear that neither of them use bones of any kind in their potions. He says “people like him” are being made scapegoats for criminals and a political conspiracy because the government has lost control of the situation. “This is a syndicate by some influential people in this country who are interested in body parts of albinos. They simply want to take the attention away from them; that is why they are accusing us,” he declares.\n“Albinos have existed for a long time and we have also existed for a long time,” he adds.\nIn June 2016, Malawi’s High Court banned \"witch doctors, traditional healers, charm sellers, fortune tellers and magicians,\" in an effort to quell the trade in the bones of people with albinism.\nTraditional healers such as Usmani and Masiyambuyo argue that only hurts the people they help.\n“People think we deal with witchcraft, but we are here to help people,” Masiyambuyo says, earnestly, opening his arms.\nAccording to the Traditional Healers Association of Malawi, up to 97 percent of the population visit traditional healers and herbalists. It is hard to verify this but it is clear that many people do use them, particularly in rural areas, where the state is often conspicuous by its absence.\nThere are two physicians and 59 nurses for every 100,000 people in Malawi. The ratio is the lowest in all of sub-Saharan Africa\nUsmani says that, in such circumstances, the services he and Masiyambuyo provide are critical.\nPeople think we deal with witchcraft, but we are here to help people.- Masiyambuyo Njolomole, a traditional healer based in Dedza\nHe was trained by his father, the softly spoken traditional healer explains, and used to specialise in sexually transmitted diseases. But, “nowadays, [it’s] cancer, blood pressure, asthma, using herbs and a mixture from seven trees” he adds, showing us plastic packets of concoctions made primarily from plants.\n“People come to me when the hospitals have failed them.”\nDr Chilani is the spokesperson for Malawi’s Traditional Healers Association and tells us over the phone that “everyone [in the country], [from] farmers to politicians” uses traditional healers.\nMany believe that illness involves an “element of being bewitched”, he explains. But, he insists, “sending people to kill others” isn’t part of their craft.\n“We help people, we don’t kill them,” he says.\nThe new law targeting unlicensed traditional healers would purportedly help end these crimes. But the line between traditional healer and witch doctor isn’t always clear.\nMary Shawa, the former principal secretary at the Ministry of Gender, Children, Disability and Social Welfare, says the distinction lies in registration. “No one who obeys the law needs to feel threatened,” she explains.\nChilani’s Facebook page offers “revenge spells, fertility spells, magic rings and witchcraft spells”, but also asks that anyone with information about the bones of somebody with albinism contact him so that it can be reported to the police. He says no one has been in touch.\n“If we have been around for generations, and the killings of persons with albinism began roughly two years ago, what were we doing all this time?” he asks.\nOne lawyer for every 38,500 Malawians\nLilongwe, central region of Malawi\nPiles of paper cover Masauko Chamkakala’s desk. The director of Legal Aid, the body tasked with representing those who cannot afford legal representation, is in his office in Area 4 of Lilongwe.\nThe country’s legal system, he says, is a mess.\n“More than 90 percent of the population cannot afford legal representation. We have seven lawyers for the entire country,” he says, his hands clasped and eyebrows raised.\nThe Legal Aid Act stipulates that anyone charged with a crime that could result in a custodial sentence is entitled to legal aid, but limited resources have resulted in the courts restricting this to homicide cases.\nA 2013 report found that Malawi had fewer than 400 lawyers. That was one lawyer for every 38,500 people.\nThe jails are overcrowded and suspects can wait months or even years before their cases go to trial.\n“If you go to the prisons [and] start going through the cases, you realise that so many of these people are not supposed to be there,” Masauko says, pointing out that: “For an ordinary person to get an appointment with a lawyer will cost him K20,000 ($27), while the [monthly] minimum wage is K18,000 ($25).”\nThen there is the question of entrapment - a method that police officers have admitted to using but one which has so far led only to the arrest of sellers.\nMore than 90 percent of the population cannot afford legal representation. We have seven lawyers for the entire country.- Masauko Chamkakala, the director of Legal Aid\nIn a side office near Malawi’s High Court, Neverson Chisiza, a senior state advocate at Malawi’s Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, acknowledges that there have been discussions within the ministry about “why it is always sellers, those who are desperate [and] looking for quick money, [who] are caught, not the buyers”.\nAnd without the buyers, the police are little closer to understanding the source of this trade.\nMasouko says that the hysteria over the killings of people with albinism has reached such a height that “it is possible a person could be convicted for carrying antelope bones because they resemble human bones”.\nAnd, he adds, those accused of any crime related to people with albinism are tried in “people’s courts”.\nA question of government preparedness\nLilongwe, central region of Malawi\nIt is late on a Friday afternoon when Mary Shawa meets us in her office and her team are about to leave for the day. She is responsible for the security, health and wellbeing of Malawians with albinism.\n“Until the atrocities started, we didn’t look at persons with albinism as people with a disability. We saw them as ordinary people,” she says, adjusting her glasses.\nShe slumps back into her chair. “If you look at the demographics, they are young and old, some working as lawyers and teachers, some still in school,” she adds.\nBefore moving to this ministry in 2012, Mary was the secretary for nutrition, HIV and Aids in the president’s office, credited with tackling the country’s HIV pandemic.\nShe speaks authoritatively and frankly, rejecting any suggestion that the government hasn’t done enough to address the crimes committed against people with albinism. She rattles off the details of cases that have been solved and cites “ministerial research” to suggest that there is no market for the bones.\n“[The] culprits get the bones and walk around looking for a market to sell them,” she says.\nMary says her ministry has been leading a communications plan to tackle the crisis. “The radio messages, the billboards, this is all us,” she explains.\nBut it’s hard to tell if anyone is listening.\n“We are also compiling a census, to register all persons with albinism in the country,” she says, leaning forward, her hands resting on the desk.\nBut beyond the issue of security, people with albinism have other needs - sunscreen, hats and sunglasses to protect them from the sun. The Ministry of Health does provide zinc oxide at clinics but that only helps with the blisters and lesions and doesn’t offer any protection. Moreover, patients have to travel to the main cities to access the ointment.\nMary hints at a lack of funding. Malawi is heavily reliant on donors, and it’s unlikely that sunscreen or hats top the government’s financial priorities or a foreign government’s agenda.\nVillage of Nambilikira, Dedza district, eastern Malawi\nConfident, assertive and friendly, Clement Gweza seems as though he was born to teach. He transforms the 60 rowdy teenagers into an orderly classroom and begins his social and environmental science lesson by scribbling “How to prevent air pollution” on the blackboard.\nThe 24-year-old is smartly dressed in an off-white shirt, pinstriped tie and black trousers.\n“It was difficult at first,” he says. “The children found it hard to understand my albinism, because people, not just the learners, don’t think that a person with albinism can do something that can be recognised by society.”\nHe became a teacher, he says, because the tuition was free and he couldn’t afford to pay to study anything else.\nAt first, he worried that his students wouldn’t respect him. But, he says, “after a few weeks, the learners came round. They will tell you: ‘Ah! He is a good teacher and he understands our problems’.”\nBut he knows that, despite the respect he enjoys in the classroom, he is not safe outside of it.\nThe murder of one of his students, David Fletcher, made him afraid.\nHe has stopped walking outside at night and, if he must, he asks a close friend or relative to accompany him.\n“If I can’t find someone to take me home, I will stay where I am and sleep there. I have no choice,” he says.\n“Everything has changed. I look at the people, the friends around me, and I think ‘maybe he wants to kill me and make some money’.”\nStercia Kanyowa’s story\nMasumpankhunda, in Lilongwe, central Malawi\nTwelve-year-old Stercia Kanyowa says she doesn’t want to beg. She wants an education, and to stand on her own two feet.\n“I want to be a teacher first. Then maybe a journalist or a bank manager,” she declares.\nStercia is one of three children with albinism at the Malingunde School for the Visually Impaired. As an only child from a single-parent household, she says completing school is her only hope for the future. She has been here since 2011.\n“Of course, I miss home. It’s long since I have gone home. Who doesn’t miss home?” she says, outside her dormitory.\nThe school is government-run, and functions almost exclusively on donations. There are 17 classrooms and 40 teachers for 3,000 students.\nThere is no electricity. Inside Stercia’s classroom, some students are huddled around braille machines, while others, such as 15-year-old Foster Kennedy, who also has albinism, use a magnifying glass to read textbooks.\n“Everyone here is a friend. You would think we are born from the same mother,” Foster says, smiling.\nHe wants to be a radio personality or a songwriter, he explains.\nThe school yard is a thoroughfare for people walking or cycling to the town centre, which means that there are always strangers passing through. This concerns the school authorities. Without a wall or a gate, the school is vulnerable to theft and the students to being attacked. In early 2015, a 16-year-old student with albinism was almost abducted by a stranger who promised to buy her supplies from the local market.\n“It is an open place. And anything can happen,” says Chiko Kamphandira, the school principal.\nBack outside, Stercia, who is head of the school choir, begins to sing one of her favourite songs, before stopping suddenly, self-conscious and shy.\n“I am going to work hard and fulfill my dreams,” she says. “I don’t see myself as any different. I am just a human being.”\nIan Simbota’s story\nBlantyre, southern Malawi\nIan Simbota is eating a chicken tikka burger at a Pakistani fast food diner when we spot him one evening in Blantyre.\nWhen we ask to talk to him, he scans our journalists’ credentials before agreeing. It turns out that he gets paid to talk as a late-night radio talk show host and a DJ with the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation. And he has just returned from Kasungu, in the central region of Malawi, where he was the master of ceremonies for World International Albinism Awareness Day.\nWhen he finishes his meal, he invites us to the radio studio.\nOnce on the airwaves, the slightly pensive man we met at the restaurant is no more. He taunts and teases his listeners. The studio is his safe place.\nLater on, he talks of a double life. As a radio star, his voice and name are widely recognised. But not all of his listeners know that he has albinism. And there are times when his confident persona gives way to fear.\n“Look, I am working at night. And people know I am here,” he says. “What are they thinking, planning? From here I will get a car and go home. And when I go home, I feel unsafe. What if they attack me? I think about it all the time.”\nIan became a full-time DJ in 2015. It was a dream come true. “I wanted to be a midwife as a child [but] thankfully my mother convinced me otherwise,” he laughs.\n“And then, I wanted to be a radio host. Geoffrey Zigoma [the gospel singer] made a huge impact on my life.”\nBut life hasn’t been easy for Ian.\nWhen he was born, he was the second child in his family to have albinism. His father walked out on them.\n“My father told my mum to kill us. When she refused, he left,” he says, matter-of-factly.\n“At that time, people didn’t know about the genes and stuff. My dad thought it was a curse.”\nIan’s mother left her village in southern Malawi and came to Blantyre with her two children to look for a job. She found one as a cleaner at the College of Medicine.\nHis father remarried. His next child was also born with albinism.\nSchool was tough for Ian. He says his teachers didn’t realise that he was visually impaired so would just call him lazy. When he completed his certificate in journalism and applied for internships in radio, his visual impairments worked against him again - station managers were concerned that he wouldn’t be able to see the computer screens, he says.\nThen his mother died after a prolonged illness, and the new job felt like the start of a new life for him. But then the attacks on people with albinism began.\n“I can tell you, it has become difficult,” he says. “I have friends. But at this point in time, I only trust one friend in my circle. I have other friends, but then sometimes, you just wonder, you know, maybe, he is being used [to get close to me].”\nHe also has to face harassment on the streets and says his girlfriend left him last year because “she couldn’t deal with what … [he] was going through”.\nBut today he’s the voice of a successful radio show.\n“I like radio because you could come naked to the studio and it doesn’t matter. People are listening to your voice,” he says, pausing for a second, before laughing.\n“I have done a little bit of TV, but radio is better because listeners create a different picture of what they think you are. It’s only now [with the crisis] that people realise I am a person with albinism …”"},{"url":"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865681386/In-our-opinion-Ending-school-0lunch-shaming1-is-long-overdue.html","title":"In our opinion: Ending school 'lunch shaming' is long overdue","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"DeseretNews.com","description":"It’s unfortunate that a mandate from a federal agency is necessary to cause schools to stop doing something that common decency suggests shouldn’t be done in the first place.","date":"2017-06-06","full_text":"Laura Seitz, Deseret News\nStudents get lunch in the Mount Jordan Middle School cafeteria in Sandy on Friday, May 19, 2017. Canyons School District administrators are proposing that the school board adopt a policy that takes a kinder, gentler approach to school nutrition service to children whose accounts are in arrears.\nSo-called “lunch shaming” — the practice of taking away a student’s school lunch when they can’t pay for it — has been a surprisingly common tactic for school districts across the nation.\nWe applaud actions currently underway to find new ways to reconcile with students and parents who don’t pay their school lunch balance.\nSchool districts have been instructed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees school lunch programs, to adopt policies this year that use tactics other than “shaming” to get families to pay meal bills. It’s unfortunate that a mandate from a federal agency is necessary to cause schools to stop doing something that common decency suggests shouldn’t be done in the first place.\nIn 2014, for example, a Salt Lake City School District nutritional worker threw away 40 lunches of students with unpaid bills at Uintah Elementary School. The incident outraged parents, made national news and prompted the district to publish a policy that prohibits publicly identifying kids in arrears on meal payments or subjecting them to “ridicule and embarrassment.”\nEven before the USDA’s directive, several communities took measures to stop the practice. The New Mexico legislature passed a law requiring schools to work with parents to pay debts in lieu of subjecting children to any kind of public embarrassment in front of their peers. A similar statute has been proposed in New York. In Utah, districts are working on policies that would comply with the federal request. The Canyons District, for example, is drafting a policy that would reflect its existing practice to provide meals to kids regardless of their debt.\nAs a district spokesperson said, “That’s important to us. Students can’t learn if they’re hungry.”\nThat schools would employ any kind of shaming tactic seems archaic in this day and age — long past the time when newspapers would publish “deadbeat lists” of people owing money to local businesses. Such punitive measures, which are meant to incentivize pro-social behavior, often have unintended anti-social consequences. Consequently, for decades, federal law has protected adults against the use of public embarrassment to compel them to pay a bill. The Fair Debt Practices Act prevents debt collectors from deploying “abusive” tactics to collect owed funds.\nExposing a child to embarrassment in a school cafeteria because their family owes a few dollars smacks of an “abusive” tactic. It’s good to know that going forward, Utah schools will cease this practice that has caused children to suffer the unenviable choice between hunger and humiliation."},{"url":"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media-literacy-can-help-students-discern-fake-news","title":"How media literacy can help students discern fake news","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"PBS NewsHour","description":"Recognizing bias in news stories is one form of media literacy.

Spotting when the news is entirely fabricated, like these stories, is something else entirely.\nOften, these stories are designed to look as if they come from legitimate news organizations, and are meant to be easily shared on social media, resulting in confusion over what’s real.\nDuring the recent election season, there have been reports of a concerted effort to spread fake news, in a bid to influence public opinion. A recent Stanford University study of almost 8,000 students showed they were easily duped online.\nResearchers found, overall, young people’s ability to reason about the information on the Internet can be summed up in one word: bleak.\nYou have been working on media literacy for how long?\nCLAIRE BEACH, Media Literacy Now: About 40 years.\nKAVITHA CARDOZA: Claire Beach is a media literacy advocate and former teacher.

Her voice was constricted as she loaded medication into a device about the size of her palm.\n“Capsule in. You close it and you push this blue button,” Milton said, demonstrating how the device punctures the pill. She then takes two labored breaths to inhale the powder inside the capsule. “And that’s it.”\nMilton, like many Medicare enrollees, is on a fixed income. She has $2,000 a month to pay for a mortgage, car payment, Medicare premiums and other expenses.\n“I got to stretch out that, plus I have the less costly medicines that I have to pay for and also my oxygen,” Milton said. “You can only stretch it so far.”\nAn estimated 1 in 9 Medicare beneficiaries are diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. And, in 2014, COPD was the third-leading cause of death in the country, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Inhalers like Spiriva and Advair account for billions in Medicare spending each year.\nYet, even if responsible only for monthly copays, many enrollees like Milton can’t afford their inhalers. Milton depends on free samples provided by her doctor for her prescription of Breo Ellipta — the supply is limited, so she regularly skips one of the two daily doses. And she received one year’s worth of free samples for Spiriva after applying for drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim’s financial assistance program.\nMilton was down to two doses of Spiriva one recent morning. Holding up a silver sleeve of medication, Milton said: “This is all I have left. So, if [the drugmaker doesn’t] approve me for this year, I’m going to have to ask Dr. Stigall if there’s something else I can take.”\nThat would be Dr. Brian Stigall of Hill Country Medical Associates in New Braunfels, Texas, who keeps a closet full of free drug samples for patients like Milton.\n“Thank goodness, the drug reps are good. They bring us lots of samples,” Stigall said. “I save those samples back for those Medicare patients.”\nWithout the inhalers, patients suffer, he said. “They are going to end up back in the hospital and they’re going to end up seeing me much more often.”\nPatients who suffer a full-blown attack, due to low oxygen intake, could need three to seven days of emergency treatment, Stigall said.\nRetiree Ken Wagar, who lives in Winter Haven, Fla., buys his inhalers overseas. Instead of paying Medicare copays of more than $500 for three-month supplies of Advair and Spiriva, Wagar pays $248 for the same amount of Advair and $73 for Spiriva.\n“It’s common and easy,” said Wagar, 68. “You have to order in advance because it takes awhile to ship. … You do what you have to do.”\nAcross the country, doctors who treat COPD said costs are a common problem for patients. Dr. David Mannino at the University of Kentucky College of Public Health said some patients cut pills in half or take a prescription once a day instead of twice, just to save money.\nDr. Momen Wahidi, a pulmonologist at Duke University School of Medicine, said many patients “weren’t able to use [an inhaler because they] couldn’t get it, couldn’t afford it.”\nDr. Peter Castaldi of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston surveyed thousands of Medicare patients in 2006. Up to a third said they couldn’t take their medication because of cost.\n“Even at a relatively seemingly low amount of $20-per-month out-of-pocket costs, you could see the effects of cost on people being able to take their medications,” Castaldi said.\nAnd prices have only increased since 2006. Spiriva’s list price has jumped 31 percent the past five years to $368 for a 30-day supply, according to drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim. And Breo Ellipta’s price has risen 20 percent since 2013 to $321.74 a month, according to drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline.\nSpokespeople for both drug companies said insured patients would not pay those prices because of discounts, rebates and other price concessions negotiated with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. For example, GlaxoSmithKline estimated that the average out-of-pocket cost for patients with Medicare’s drug coverage, Medicare Part D, was $33 in 2015, when the drug’s list price was $281 for a month’s supply.\nBut it’s “not unusual [for patients] to be on more than one inhaler” and those costs add up, said Dr. Chien-Wen Tseng, with the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine and the Pacific Health Research and Education Institute.\nIn a recent letter published in JAMA Internal Medicine, Tseng analyzed Medicare’s prescription drug formularies in 2015 and the projected cost of deductibles and copays. She found that Medicare Part D beneficiaries with multiple inhalers could spend more than $2,800 in out-of-pocket costs annually.\nThe high price of inhalers is expensive for the Medicare program and “drives people into the doughnut hole,” she said. The dreaded doughnut hole is a coverage gap for Medicare Part D patients. Enrollees pay more for drugs out-of-pocket once the coverage gap is reached.\n“Medicare Part D was really designed in 2006 with 2006 prices,” Tseng said. In 2017, with much higher drug prices, “does Medicare Part D really still work?” she asked.\nFor Milton, the answer seems obvious: It doesn’t. Most mornings after taking her Spiriva, Milton sits on her back patio. There, she talks with God.\n“I don’t pray,” she said. “I talk. I carry on a conversation.”\nAnd that conversation often turns to her struggles with COPD.\n“I understand and I have to accept it. I know that it was my doing,” Milton said, adding, “everything is in his hands.”\nKHN’s coverage of prescription drug development, costs and pricing is supported in part by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.\nEditor’s note: After this story was published, GlaxoSmithKline, which manufactures Breo Ellipta, noted that the drug is not intended for twice-daily use."},{"url":"http://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/2017/05/29/viewing-13-reasons-why-daughter-important-lesson/353001001","title":"Viewing '13 Reasons Why' with daughter is important lesson","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Post-Crescent Media","description":"Talking about the issues is key if you choose to watch this Netflix series.","date":"","full_text":"Raising a teenager can sometimes be scary. You do everything in your power to protect them from anything that will bring them harm. You talk to them about the dangers of risky behavior, about peer pressure, about their future. You want to raise them right and instill in them values that will help them lead a successful life.\nI make it a point to be open and honest with my children. The world is not always a beautiful place. There are ugliness and pain. Life is often unfair. Turning a blind eye to it isn't realistic. So, when my teenage daughter asked me to watch the popular Netflix series \"13 Reasons Why\" with her, I agreed. I knew that it dealt with suicide, sexual assault and cyber bullying and although I felt she would be able to handle the content I didn't want her to watch it alone.\nRELATED: Green Bay experts discuss '13 Reasons Why' at 6 p.m. Tuesday\nIt took us about a week to get through the episodes. It was sometimes difficult and uncomfortable to watch, but we talked about it. She showed maturity, empathy and the ability to separate the fictional events of the show from the very real issues it strives to raise awareness about.\nShe spoke about the prevalence of mental health issues she sees in her friends and other students at her high school. She talked about witnessing bullying, the abuse of alcohol and drugs and most importantly, the emotions that young people experience that can lead them down a bad path.\nI made it clear that she has my support no matter what happens, that if she needs help with anything, I'll be there. Although she insisted that she already knows that, it doesn't hurt to repeat it often.\n\"13 Reasons Why\" has raised awareness, but it has also created controversy because of its unflinching portrayal of suicide and sexual assault. Are those particular scenes unnecessary? Do they go too far? I don't claim to know. What I do know is that it's getting people to talk about the very real issues that teens sometimes face. I don't see that as a negative thing.\nI also don't think the series is for everyone and I definitely don't think young children should see it. It's important to know your teenager's level of sensitivity and their mindset before you decide to watch it together. And that's the most crucial element: to watch it together so that the issues can be discussed, questions can be asked and answers can be given, no matter how hard it might be to broach these painful subjects.\nI'm grateful my daughter and I have the type of relationship that we could watch this show together and talk about it.

By mid-April, the alpine snowpack is likely at its peak. Warming temperatures in May or June will then melt the snow, sending droplets rushing down a mountain stream or seeping into the soil to replenish an aquifer.\nThe West’s water supply depends on each of these interconnected sources: the frozen reservoir of snow atop mountain peaks, mighty rivers like the Colorado and groundwater reserves deep below the earth’s surface. But the snowpack is becoming less reliable, one of the region’s most important rivers is diminishing and in many places the groundwater level has dropped. Three recent studies illuminate the magnitude of these declines, the role climate change has played and the outlook for the future.\nAll three studies point to the influence of a warming climate. “Climate change is real, it’s here now, it’s serious and it’s impacting our water supplies in a way that will affect all of us,” says Bradley Udall, a water and climate researcher at Colorado State University. The situation is dire, he says, but reining in greenhouse gas emissions now could help keep the mountains covered with snow and the rivers and aquifers wet.\nThe study: “The twenty-first century Colorado River hot drought and implications for the future,” Water Resources Research, February/March 2017.\nThe takeaway: On average, Colorado River flows were nearly 20 percent lower between 2000 and 2014 compared to the historical norm. Warm weather caused by climate change — not just a lack of precipitation — was the culprit. As the mercury continues to climb, the Colorado could drop by more than half by century’s end.\nWhat it means: The Colorado River basin has been in a drought since 2000. Warmer-than-normal temperatures were responsible for about a third of the flow declines. The upper basin is 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer now than during the 1900s, meaning more water is lost to the atmosphere through evaporation from soil, streams and other water bodies. Plants also use more water when it’s hot, partly because the growing season is longer.\nDeclining flows will further stress the already over-allocated river, which supplies nearly 40 million people in two countries. The authors note that the basin would need a precipitation spike of 4 to 20 percent to counterbalance the flow-reducing effect of future warmer temperatures — “a major and unprecedented change” compared to the past.\nArizona, California and Nevada have been negotiating to reduce their demands on the Colorado, but haven’t agreed on a final plan to address future shortages. “Frankly, that drought contingency plan needs to be put in place just to deal with the river as it is today,” Udall, a study co-author, told the Washington Post. And while the plan will help get the lower basin into balance, it may not be enough to deal with future declines big enough to impact the entire basin, which also includes parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.\nThe study: “Large near-term projected snowpack loss over the western United States,” Nature Communications, April 2017.\nThe takeaway: The West’s mountain snowpack supplies about two-thirds of the region’s water. But it dropped by 10 to 20 percent between the 1980s and 2000s. Within the next three decades, the snowpack could further shrink, by as much as 60 percent.\nWhat it means: Measurements of the amount of water held within snow from hundreds of stations from Washington to New Mexico revealed the extent of the decline in recent decades. Simulations showed that natural elements alone, like volcanic and solar activity, were not enough to account for the dip. Including factors influenced by humans — like changes in greenhouse gas concentrations — produced models that matched historical reality, implicating climate change as the cause of the snowpack loss.\nThe study’s predictions for the future range from a drastic drop in snowpack to even a slight gain by 2040. Climate change alone will likely cause a further decrease of about 30 percent, says study co-author John Fyfe, a researcher at Environment and Climate Change Canada. But natural variations in atmospheric conditions above the Pacific could temporarily make the decline worse — or nix it, depending on how they fluctuate. So water managers need to be prepared for both extremes. “It’s a cyclic phenomenon,” Fyfe says. “It’s eventually going to come around and bite you.”\nThe study: “Depletion and response of deep groundwater to climate-induced pumping variability,” Nature Geoscience, January 2017.\nThe takeaway: Aquifers have been drawn down in several areas across the country. In parts of California and Nevada, however, groundwater levels have actually risen, perhaps reflecting the success of regulations and recharge projects.\nWhat it means: Aquifer levels declined in about half of the deep groundwater wells monitored nationwide between 1940 and 2015. The lower Mississippi basin, the High Plains over the Ogallala Aquifer, and California’s Central Valley overall have experienced some of the nation’s highest rates of groundwater depletion in recent years. The study found that during dry periods, water users pump more even as natural recharge diminishes, leading to rapid drawdowns in aquifers. Regional studies in Idaho and California reveal a similar pattern of overdraft, particularly during droughts. That can lead to dry wells, land subsidence, ecological damage and other problems.\nSometimes, however, those trends can be reversed. Researchers also found that groundwater levels rose in about 20 percent of the wells, including around Las Vegas and in limited sections of the Central Valley, while the remainder of the wells showed no change. Tess Russo, a hydrologist at Pennsylvania State University and study co-author, cautions that the groundwater level increases could be misleading in places — some wells were monitored for as little as ten years, and if that period happened to be particularly rainy, measurements may not represent an area’s long-term history.\nBut wet periods and groundwater recharge projects have helped replenish some aquifers. “In many cases, we have plenty of water,” Russo says. Alleviating water stress may be a matter of changing policies and management, including how and where specific crops are grown.\nEmily Benson is an editorial intern at High Country News.

That will be done throughout the year by Rosa Patton, a National Carousel Association-recognized carousel restorer. She will be in town about once every two months to work on the animals and instruct volunteers. The first six animals are expected to be painted during the first week of August.\nThe mechanicals, rounding board and scenery panels are being repaired at Carousel and Carvings in Marion, Ohio. The company will also repair a rare rocking chariot and create an Erie Canal barge chariot to go with Sal the Mule, a Herschell-Spillman piece acquired from a collector.\nWork began without fanfare on April 24 and is expected to be completed by June 2018. The carousel is expected to be located near Clinton's Dish at Canalside later that summer.\nDespite the decades of storage, only one of the wooden animals had dry rot. Overall, they're in good condition, Stanczyk said.\n\"The wood itself is in very good shape,\" he said. \"The joints are compromised.\"\nSaving original wood\nWork on the animals begins in a stripping booth, a small room where hide glue and nails or screws used to assemble them are removed. Heat is used, but no chemicals. Workers use respirators, wear body suits and take other precautions in case the animals contain lead paint.\nNext, they remove the paint by sanding the animals down to their natural wood. Re-carving occurs if a piece is missing.\n\"We pride ourselves in saving every bit of possible original wood, where most companies will replace them because it's easier,\" said Stanczyk, a retired senior engineering technician at Moog.\nThe animals are then reassembled using epoxies and sanded again. The process for each animal takes about two weeks, and then they are ready to be painted, he said.\nSix coats of primer and paint – three coats of alcohol-based bin, two coats of oil-based primer and one coat of Dover White paint – are applied to protect and seal the wood before the decorative paint can go on.\nA color card used by Spillman Engineering in 1924 allows each figure to be painted in its original colors.\nWorksheets are filled out to carefully document the work done on each animal.\nThe restoration project is getting help from two decorative painting groups, Buffalo Snowbirds Decorative Painters from Buffalo, which painted the Herschell carousel at the Buffalo Zoo in 2000, and Genesee County Decorative Painters in Batavia. The painters even painted the walls of the no-frills rented work space with decorative flowers and a reproduction of the lead carousel horse.\nRestoring 26 horses\nSeveral women were busy on Thursday sanding two horses that had received a coat of prime in the paint area. Linda Chaffee was sanding the horse's tongue, while Helen Ronan, Christine Kasprzak and Kathy Kwiatkowski sanded the body and looked for rough patches.\n\"This is going to be part of Buffalo for a long time,\" said Michelle Schmitz, also of the Buffalo Snowbirds Decorative Painters. \"There is going to be so many people who enjoy this for generations, so it's really exciting to be a part of that. And we all love to paint, so it's an awesome opportunity for all of us.\"\nIn the woodcarving area, a decorative horse that will eventually resume its place on the carousel's outside row was disassembled.\nJim Ronan, a volunteer, used a chisel to repair a damaged hoof.\n\"Bringing back something like this is fantastic,\" Ronan said.\nJoanne Marasco and Bev O'Neill were busy sanding the horse's legs.\n\"After they've stripped it, there's always so much debris,\" Marasco said.\nThe menagerie has 26 original horses. Nearby, the lion and tiger, with their weight massed on top, were stored upside down to relieve pressure on their legs prior to being hand-stripped. A deer, in need of a missing rack to mount on its head, stood near them, while a giraffe leaned against the wall.\n\"How many places have a giraffe?\" asked Stanczyk in wonderment. \"He'll get his spots back, too.\"\nA vintage sea dragon will also be taking the place of the handsomely carved lead horse, which will be put on permanent display.\n\"This is so wonderful,\" said Laurie Hauer-LaDuca, Buffalo Heritage Carousel's president and the person who located the 1924 carousel. \"It couldn't be a better process to be a part of.\"\nSeeing them back in North Tonawanda was a dream come true, she said.\n\"The level of detail in these pieces is really quite extraordinary,\" Hauer-LaDuca said. \"Having looked at figures for over 30 years, the amount of detail and three-dimensional carving on these pieces compared to what you would see on a portable machine or early park machine is incredible. I have never seen carvings like this.\"\nThe machine, with its three rows of horses, will be only the 10th park-style carousel in operation in the nation. The rare deluxe model was made by the Herschell-Spillman Co., a pre-eminent carousel maker, or its successor, Spillman Engineering.\n\"To have a complete carousel from 1924 that we have the opportunity to restore is just not going to happen again,\" Stanczyk said. \"There just aren't that many around to do it.\""},{"url":"https://qz.com/997433/us-jobs-report-only-138000-jobs-added-in-may-conservatives-blame-the-deep-state","title":"Conservative Twitter is blaming the “deep state” for the lackluster US jobs report 😑","author_text":"Elisabeth Ponsot","keywords":[],"publication_text":"Quartz","description":"The US economy added 138,000 jobs in May, down from 174,000 in April and below analyst predictions of 185,000 jobs, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said today.

The 2016 presidential campaign also saw routine economic statistics called into question as potentially cooked for partisan gain.\nToday, conservative online talk radio host Bill Mitchell and others pointed to discrepancies between the BLS numbers and the survey released by US payroll management company ADP, which said 253,000 private-sector jobs were added in May.\nEverything in this bizarro Labor Report is the exact opposite of everything in the ADP Report. Will any inquiring journalist ask why?\n— Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) June 2, 2017\nOkay, we’ll bite.\nWhy is there a difference between the ADP and BLS jobs numbers?\nADP releases its report two days before the official BLS numbers come out each month. Its estimates of job growth are based on data from its clients (about one-fifth of U.S. private payroll employment), past BLS data, unemployment insurance claims, surveys of consumer confidence, oil prices, and more (pdf).\nThe BLS surveys businesses and households monthly to generate the official estimates of jobs gained and lost. These results are revised periodically to reflect more complete information and a better understanding of seasonal factors, among other things.\nBack in 2012, Wall Street Journal (paywall) columnist Steven Russolillo cautioned readers that there is often a “wide divergence” between ADP data and government numbers. “It’s been well documented how ADP’s report, which measures private-sector job growth, has an uneven track record of predicting the nonfarm payrolls data,” he wrote. “Some months it’s spot on, others it’s wildly off base.”\nThis is the second month we've seen this BS: ADP says we created 253,000 jobs but Labor says only 138,000! You NEVER saw this under Obama.\n— Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) June 2, 2017\nIs it unusual to see a significant disparity between the ADP and BLS reports?\nNo.\nThe difference between the number of new private-sector, non-farm jobs reported by ADP and the BLS every month is greater than 40,000 about half the time, according to a CNBC analysis of the figures since November 2012.\n“The ADP may be a valuable measurement reflecting economic fundamentals, but for an investor looking to predict what the market will do… the headline number is probably not very useful for specific predictions — such as whether the BLS will beat consensus estimates,” CNBC wrote.\nAccording to Labor, March's jobs numbers got slashed 37% and April's 18%.

Another example of medicine ignoring the wishes of expectant parents.\nAshley was in her second trimester when she began to miscarry. As she asked questions in her obstetrician’s office and requested surgical help for the miscarriage, her doctor instructed her to just go home and wait for the pregnancy to pass. “We don’t want people to think we do that sort of thing here,” he told her, referring to abortion.\nAshley was sent back to her Texas home with Cytotec (an ulcer medication with an off-label use for labor augmentation) — and twelve hours later, she began to hemorrhage. Ashley remembers her then-husband carrying her into the hospital, where she spent several days. “There was so much blood,” she said. “There was a trail of blood behind us. Blood all over the car. It was awful.”\nCases like Ashley’s may multiply in the near future.\nTwo new bills in Texas — SB 25 and HB 434 — aim to embolden doctors to withhold or restrict information from pregnant patients. Both bills eliminate the wrongful birth cause of action clause, which would prevent patients from suing doctors for withholding information about a fetus’ health or disability. In effect, they would prevent parents from seeking abortion.\nIn other words, these bills would make easier for doctors to follow a long-standing practice in medicine: lying to or coercing pregnant patients.\nWhile most laboring patients are no longer subjected to mid-century “knock-em-out practices — in which women could expect to be separated from family members, strapped down during birth, or not meet their new babies for hours or longer — a paternalistic tone still lingers in obstetrics today.\nAccording to Listening to Mothers III Survey, a report on childbirth experiences in the U.S., many patients reported concerns about practices that weren’t grounded in evidence. In particular, pregnant patients were concerned with the lack of support for VBAC (vaginal birth after Cesarean), being given an episiotomy without consent (i.e., a surgical cut at the vaginal opening), and being coerced to give birth in a back-lying position.\nPregnancy and childbirth can conjure complex feelings for patients who are grateful for their healthy baby, but simultaneously feel like they were violated or stripped of their autonomy in the process.\nFrom a doctor’s standpoint, meanwhile, obstetric ethics are uniquely dicey: obstetricians are charged with caring for a pregnant patient while also offering the best course of treatment for the fetus.\nSometimes physicians override patients’ wishes, citing their obligation to the fetal well-being. After all, who would object to the argument that one’s baby may die without intervention? The doctor may well be telling the truth — or they could be impatient to get the birth over with, or know they have conflicting beliefs about abortion.\nI asked people on Facebook if an OB had ever lied to them while they were pregnant. Here are just a handful of the dozens of responses I received:\nSarah was told during one of her prenatal visits that all the OBs in the practice accommodated however patients wanted to give birth. “While pushing, I was making a lot of noise, and wanted to be squatting or on hands and knees because it felt better. Even though I was told I would be supported in whatever position I felt most comfortable in, my OB told me that the noises I was making were better suited for the bathroom, and that she couldn’t work with the positions I was in. I was forced onto a toilet, and later forced onto my back.”\nCandice specifically told her OB that she did not want her membranes stripped (a process in which a provider inserts fingers inside the cervix and then uses them to separate the bag of waters from the uterus near the cervix to try to encourage labor to start). “When I was about 41.4 [weeks] she “checked” me and when she was done I was like: ‘my husband and I wanted to discuss the possibility of stripping my membranes when I reach 42 weeks to help avoid induction.’ She said: ‘Oh that’s okay, I decided to just go ahead and strip you when I was checking you just now.’ I felt so disrespected.”\nJessica had a vicious episiotomy during her first birth that took more than a year to heal properly. When she became pregnant again, she made it clear to her OB that she wanted to avoid a repeat episiotomy. “He went into the “I only cut when medically necessary” song and dance…. On birth day things were so fast and easy. There were no problems. Nothing. Just before the head was born he gave me some story about a small cut and gave me the episiotomy before he even finished his sentence. He did not get my consent!”\nJessica looked into her doctor’s statistics and learned that he actually performs episiotomies most of the time, contradicting his assertion that he only cut ‘when medically necessary.’ Since 2006, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recommended against routine episiotomy and since that time, the national rate has dropped to 12%. “The script I heard at my prenatal was just to placate me and move on from the topic.”\nJessie had an agreement with her OB that the umbilical cord would not be touched until it was done pulsating. (Because of research-backed benefits to infants from the additional blood volume gained from the placenta following birth, ACOG recommends delayed cord clamping for all healthy infants.) But, Jessie says that 2 seconds after her baby was born, the doctor clamped the cord anyway.\nJessie also was forced into a birthing position that was uncomfortable, even though she had been assured she could birth in whatever position she wanted. “He told me he encouraged women birthing in whatever position felt right, yet as I was squatting [he] came in and left muttering something how he wasn’t going to do that, and the nurses put me on the table, making me push while laying almost flat on my back.”\nACOG has spoken out against restricting pregnant patient’s autonomy. “When the pregnant woman and fetus are conceptualized as separate patients, the pregnant woman and her medical interests, health needs, and rights can become secondary to those of the fetus. At the extreme, construing the fetus as a patient sometimes can lead to the pregnant woman being seen as a “fetal container” rather than as an autonomous agent.”\nThey also pointed out how coercive policies are disparately applied to poor people and people of color: “In a review of 21 court-ordered interventions, 81% involved women of color and 24% involved women who did not speak English as a first language. Likewise, a systematic review of more than 400 cases of coerced interventions found that most cases included allegations against low-income women.”\nWhile the right to have an abortion and the right to make decisions in childbirth have historically been treated as separate issues, they are part of the same struggle. In places where the right to abortion is most often restricted by legislators, the right to make decisions in childbirth is most often restricted by doctors. The Texas bills bring these struggles together in a way that shouldn’t be ignored: by melding legislative and physician control over pregnant bodies.\nThe Development Set is made possible by funding from the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation.

So with the holiday season upon us, here is a list that would meet his approval. These gifts for the food lovers on your list are bound to be received as welcome additions to cupboards and kitchens, but they also fill more than a stocking: Think living wages, community facilities, and charitable giving that makes a real impact.\nSugar and Spice\nMember-owned since 1976, Frontier Co-op gives 4 percent of its annual net savings back to the communities where it sources its products. That means a dental clinic in Guatemala for the Maya families who grow cardamom and allspice and a school that provides lodging and food for the children of cinnamon growers in Vietnam. At home in Norway, Iowa, employee volunteers planted 21 acres of tallgrass prairie in 1992 that later became part of the United Plant Savers Botanical Sanctuary Network, a group dedicated to restoring and preserving natural habitats and native plants. The spices, which include ready-for-dinner blends such as herbes de Provence, alder-smoked salt, and garam masala, are nonpareil.\nVisibility in Black and White\nThe Female Farmer Project’s Audra Mulkern partnered with artist and author Anna Brones to create these limited-edition greeting cards. The “I Look Like a Farmer” paper-cut illustrations are based on portraits Mulkern shot during her multiyear project documenting the rise of women in agriculture. The cards are printed in Seattle by Girlie Press, a women-owned business, and half the proceeds go toward supporting women farmers through the microloan organization Kiva and U.S.-based Women Food \u0026 Ag Network.\nA Well of Water and Goodwill\nThe staff of Dig Deep was out of the office last week, helping to protect the water rights of the Standing Rock Reservation, but it is still working to bring water to the Navajo Nation too. The Navajo Water Project will bring solar power and running water to 75 families in New Mexico. The project is community-led and supported by proceeds from gifts like these hand-beaded leather cuffs and Pendleton blankets woven with Navajo designs.\nRise and Shine\nCounter Culture Coffee is mostly known for its obsessive attention to sourcing, roasting, and brewing the best cup of coffee with the world’s best beans. The company is less known for Seeds, an initiative aimed at promoting food security and environmental stewardship in the communities where the beans are sourced. In November and December, a nickel from each bag of coffee sold goes to Seeds’ climate change adaptation program, which was developed with research from the Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment. The annual holiday brew, Iridescent, kicks in an additional donation and brews up a cup with sweet notes of dark chocolate and berry.\nNot a Fruit Basket (Praise!)\nWith Food Forward’s No Fruit of the Month Club, you guarantee zero fruit baskets stuffed with paper streamers, waxy apples, and underripe pears for folks who can shop for fine fruit themselves. Instead, your $60 gets 500 pounds of produce from the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market to hunger relief agencies, which then distribute it to people in need.\nOn Second Thought...\nWe have nothing against fruit baskets when they’re like this. Fill one of these baskets with blood oranges, and you’ve given a friend the gift of jewel-toned juice while supporting a woman-owned small business. All Across Africa, a certified B Corporation, connects 3,200 artisans and 45 different cooperatives with fans of bright, handwoven African baskets. Want one for your bike? The Basket Room, a woman-owned company, works directly with weaving cooperatives in Ghana to make a version that hooks onto your handlebars.\nSpare Them Fruitcake; Send Stollen\nIn place of fruitcake, send the nice people on your list fruit-filled, Dresden-style stollen and rich chocolate cherry rolls baked by Hot Bread Kitchen. In the paid six-month bakers-in-training program, one of New York’s leading suppliers of artisanal multiethnic breads teaches women the trade of bread baking and includes lessons in English as a second language, bakery math, and science. After the training, all the program’s graduates are placed in full-time fair-wage positions with access to benefits and opportunities for further development. Hot Bread Kitchen, which began in founder Jessamyn Rodriguez’s home kitchen, also offers an incubator program for burgeoning food businesses that includes commercial kitchen space and mentoring.\nProducts for Change (and a Better Pantry)\nThis gift set, called A Product of Change Collection, elevates bedtime with a traditional Filipino version of hot chocolate and upgrades a pantry staple to something award-winning—all while providing 370 meals to students in the Philippines and Tanzania. Askinosie Chocolate, named one of Forbes’ 25 best small companies in America, is known not only for its bean-to-bar methods but for profit sharing with the farmers in Ecuador, Honduras, Tanzania, and the Philippines from whom it sources.

Officials at Merrill Field briefly rerouted airplane traffic when paper lanterns appeared in the flight path. After the event, police received calls about the rerouted planes and about a vehicle that almost crashed after a lantern landed on top of it.\nResidents are also concerned with the lanterns landing in their backyard and starting a fire, state Life Safety Inspection Bureau Supervisor Jeff Morton said.\n\"They wanted nothing to do with them, for obvious reasons,\" Morton said. \"It's like lighting a paper airplane and throwing it into the wind.

Magazine","description":"","date":"","full_text":"I’m in Hungary, tired and jetlagged, and pissed off as hell about President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. I’m about to give a talk to a group of young Hungarians at a “future trends” conference. These are conferences about the future and what is happening in the culture. I get invited to these conferences because, as No Impact Man, I am an anthropological curiosity—the guy who lived with no environmental impact for a year. And I guess, because of that, people think I am an arbiter of future trends of the environmental kind.\nI have a talk prepared. I’ve sent in the PowerPoint presentation. As I type, it’s been about 90 minutes since the New York Times posted about the president’s decision on the Paris climate accord. Signed by nearly every country in the world, it’s the result of nearly 20 years of diplomacy. Metaphorically speaking, Trump is in a position to be the world’s firefighter; but instead of fighting the fire, he has decided to pour gas on it.\nWhen I climb up on stage, what can I say the “future trend” is when it comes to environment?\nPart of me wants to walk on and rant about Trump for 20 minutes. I feel sad. I feel angry. I feel deeply frustrated that we all don’t just walk out of our jobs until our governments do the right thing. After all, the fossil fuel economy can’t work if we don’t. Part of me wants to say to the audience who I guess might be largely passive people: “I hope you’re happy because now we are truly screwed.”\nI say part of me wants to say that. Want to know why it’s only part of me? Because actually, I still don’t believe we are. Screwed.\nI still don’t believe we are screwed. Not quite yet.\nJust yesterday, the California Senate passed legislation that will have the state receive 100 percent of its energy from renewables like solar and wind by 2045. Last month, the Atlanta City Council unanimously voted to commit to a 100 percent renewable energy goal, becoming the 27th U.S. city to do so. On June 1, the same day Trump announced the Paris accord withdrawal, the last coal-powered station in all of New England, which happened to be near my home town in Massachusetts, closed down for good.\nIn other words, at least in my hopes, by the time Trump revives coal production, there could be no one willing to burn it. If, that is, you and I do the work. Because now that Trump has abdicated his responsibility, we now have a lot more. Trump was never the last bastion between us and complete climate disaster. We are.\nThere are so many ways we can slow and stop the burning of fossil fuels in the United States. If Atlanta can commit to 100 percent renewables, so can all our cities and states. But to get our cities and states and businesses to make those commitments, we have to force them. We each need to spend hours working with our climate and social justice organizations to figure out how to force our cities and state politicians to represent the people who voted for them instead of the corporations who fund them.\nOn top of that, even while our energy production is dirty, we can also emit fewer greenhouse gasses by learning to live less energy-intensive lifestyles. We are going to have to tolerate less air conditioning in summer and less heat in winter. We are going to have to wear more sweaters, drive less, eat less meat. But the great news about these measures is that we can succeed in them straight away.\nOf course, we have to start getting involved in organizing for the mid-term federal elections.\nMeanwhile, it’s been about two hours since I heard the news of Trump’s decision. It is about half an hour since I sat at this keyboard to write this column. Having written what I have—that we are not yet screwed if we choose not to be—I know what I will say at that future trends conference tomorrow. I know what I will say about the future trend of our environment and its ability to support our species.\nI will say, regardless of Trump, the trend with regards to the environment still depends on one thing. Us.

No service was planned. And the death notice, which he had drafted himself a few years ago, made no mention of the suffering he had stoically endured for 58 years, his last three decades in a wheelchair and bed-bound, or the cause of it: a relatively routine back operation that left his legs paralyzed when he was 19 and consigned him to a lifetime of urinary incontinence.\nYet by the time of his death, that surgery — with its horrific outcome — had taken its place in the annals of medical law. It had led to a landmark court ruling that fundamentally transformed how doctors deal with patients in evaluating the risks of potential treatment.\n“This is probably one of the handful of most significant medicolegal cases in United States history,” said Jacob M. Appel, a doctor and bioethicist.\nThe ruling, by a federal appeals court in Washington in 1972, declared that before a patient provided informed consent to surgery or other proposed treatment, a doctor must disclose the risks, benefits and alternatives that a reasonable person would consider relevant.\nPreviously, the onus of soliciting that information had rested with the patient, and any description of risks was provided at the doctor’s discretion. A doctor had been considered negligent only when treatment was administered against the patient’s wishes.\n“It would not be an exaggeration to say that the opinion is the cornerstone of the law of informed consent” to medical treatment, “not only in the United States, but in other English-speaking countries, too,” said Prof. Alan Meisel, who teaches law and psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.\nThe historical importance of his case was unbeknown to Mr. Canterbury and his family until about a decade ago, when Professor Meisel, who was researching the ruling, explained to them how it had benefited an untold number of subsequent patients.\nFor Mr. Canterbury, of course, it was, as Professor Meisel said, “the most Pyrrhic of victories.”\nJerry Watson Canterbury was born March 12, 1939, in Cyclone, W.Va., a hardscrabble hamlet in coal country near the Kentucky border. His father, Ott, was killed in a mining accident when Jerry was 9. He was raised by his widowed mother, the former Martha Morgan.\nLike his two older brothers, Mr. Canterbury escaped Cyclone after graduating from high school, choosing not to risk a dangerous and perhaps fleeting job in the failing coal mines.\nRejected at a steel mill in Canton, he responded to an F.B.I. recruitment mailing, took a Greyhound bus 350 miles to Washington and was hired to work nights in the personnel records department as a clerk and messenger in January 1958.\nThe next December, after complaining of severe neck and back pain, he was referred to a prominent neurosurgeon, Dr. William T. Spence.\nAs Judge Spottswood W. Robinson III later wrote for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the case, Canterbury v. Spence, “The record we review tells a depressing tale.”\nAfter undergoing a myelogram, in which dye is injected into the spinal column, Mr. Canterbury was told that he had a ruptured disk. Dr. Spence recommended a laminectomy, or decompression surgery, to relieve pressure on the spinal cord.\nThe day after the operation, Mr. Canterbury apparently fell out of bed trying to urinate. His legs became numb and he had difficulty breathing. He was rushed to emergency surgery.\nHe was discharged from the hospital three and a half months later, his legs partly paralyzed.\nAt first the F.B.I. accommodated his requests to be in a warmer climate or to be closer to his family. But after being transferred to Houston, he quit in 1962 and returned to Washington, where he worked briefly as a typist for National Geographic magazine before resigning because of depression.\nHe moved to Canton to be close to his siblings and his mother. In 1967, he was hired as a dispatcher in the Stark County Sheriff’s Office, a job he held for 20 years, much of it on crutches and later in a wheelchair, until his condition deteriorated and he became bed-bound.\nBy the time Mr. Canterbury’s five-year-old suit went to trial in 1968, his case was still fraught with questions. The one-year statute of limitations on battery — the legal charge for failing to get a patient’s consent to be treated — had expired, so the consent argument was included in a broader accusation of negligence.\nBut what constituted negligence? What caused his paralysis? His original condition? The surgery? His fall? The second operation? And did the doctor’s care differ from what another reasonable physician would have done?\nIn the middle of the trial, lawyers for Dr. Spence argued that Mr. Canterbury lacked the evidence to proceed. The judge agreed.\nBut the appeals court said the jury should have decided whether the doctor’s assurance, that the laminectomy was “no more serious than an ordinary, everyday operation,” should have included the caveat that 1 percent of those surgeries result in paralysis.\nAt a second trial, Dr. Spence acknowledged that he had informed Mr. Canterbury and his mother only that the surgery might result in “weakness,” not mentioning paralysis. He said he had not issued a more specific warning because it might have deterred the patient from needed surgery.\nBut the jury ruled against Mr. Canterbury, agreeing with the defense’s contention that he had in the meantime undermined his own credibility by consenting to another laminectomy. The jury did so “despite the fact that it was far more reasonable for Canterbury to accept the risk of paralysis the second time because he already was partially paralyzed,” Professor Meisel wrote in the book “Health Law \u0026 Bioethics: Cases in Context.”\nDr. Appel said the Canterbury case profoundly affected future litigation, well beyond broadening the definition of informed consent.\n“The major legal implication of the decision,” he said, “was that it largely shifted our culture from a ‘professional practice standard’ to a ‘reasonable person standard’ in malpractice cases, undermined the tradition and practice of physicians not testifying against each other, and largely opened the floodgates to the far more litigious medicolegal culture we have today.”\nMr. Canterbury’s sister, Nancy Farahmand, said he died March 15 in Hartville, Ohio, and that the cause was complications of pulmonary disease. Besides her, he is survived by his brothers, Jack, James and John. A brief marriage in 1967 ended in divorce.\nMs. Farahmand recalled that her brother’s condition “cost him dearly physically, emotionally and financially, even though he received no compensation.”\nBut, she said in a phone interview, in his last years, the final 12 confined to his bed, he was comforted to know that his lawsuit and suffering had not been in vain.\n“He was grateful to know that his case reinforced the fact we should all be adequately informed of the risks and benefits before we provide consent to medical procedures,” she said."},{"url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/a-gunshot-and-a-child-is-dead-should-anyone-be-punished","title":"Accidental shootings involving kids often go unpunished","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Seattle Times","description":"DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Amy Pittman learned on her first day in jail to bottle up her grief. As soon as she arrived, guards took her shoelaces so she wouldn't...","date":"2017-05-24","full_text":"DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Amy Pittman learned on her first day in jail to bottle up her grief.\nAs soon as she arrived, guards took her shoelaces so she wouldn’t try to hang herself. Cry too much or scream too loud and she feared they would come back to take everything she had left — her clothes, a sheet, a plastic spork.\nBut how could she not? How could anyone? Ten weeks before, Pittman was a single mom who worked overnight shifts as a gas station cashier to keep her three kids fed and clothed.\nNow, alone in a cinderblock cell, she faced criminal charges for not doing enough to protect them. She pictured her youngest, Christian, 9, in his coffin. Blue shirt neatly tucked. Cold to the touch. Dead at the hands of his 12-year-old brother, who had accidentally shot him in the back.\n“Five minutes can change your whole life,” said Pittman, 38. “I wish every day that I would have stayed home.”\nChildren under age 12 die from gun accidents in the United States about once a week, on average. Almost every death begins with the same basic circumstances: an unsecured and loaded gun, a guardian’s lapse in attention. And each ends with the same basic questions: Who is to blame, and should the person be punished?\nAn investigation by the USA TODAY Network and The Associated Press found those questions are answered haphazardly across the nation.\nNearly identical accidents can have markedly different outcomes. A shooting that leads to a prison sentence in one state can end with no prosecution at all in another.\nIn 2015, a baby sitter in North Carolina was charged with involuntary manslaughter when a 2-year-old she was watching shot herself with a 20-gauge shotgun she found on a table. Two months later, police and prosecutors in Colorado opted not to charge a baby sitter after a 9-year-old boy was shot by his brother. The sitter had briefly left the boys unattended, and they found his loaded .38 Special in his pickup.\nGrandparents in Detroit, both 65, faced manslaughter and weapons charges that could have sent them to prison for 17 years after their 5-year-old granddaughter found a loaded pistol under their pillow and shot herself in the neck. In Illinois, a grandmother pleaded guilty to a minor gun charge and received probation after a 6-year-old boy found a revolver in a bedroom closet and shot himself: “Oh my God, I killed my baby!” she screamed to police at the scene.\nIn the days after the April 2014 death of Amy Pittman’s son, a second-grader with thick black hair he often wore in a mohawk, the decision of whom to blame fell to Cindy Kenney, an assistant district attorney in Durham whose usual mix of cases includes murders and sex assaults against children. She said Christian’s death seemed to be no ordinary accident.\nInvestigators said that in addition to the shotgun that killed Christian, they found a handgun under a mattress in a bedroom and an assault rifle in the closet. They found 100 rounds of ammunition in a grocery bag, and Kenney would later tell a judge that Pittman’s underwear drawer “had more ammunition in it than it did panties.”\nIn a country with almost as many guns as there are people, it’s not unusual to find loaded weapons within children’s reach. One study published in 2008 in the journal Health Education Research found that firearms are present in about one-third of all homes with children nationwide. Guns in half of those homes were kept unlocked; guns in one-sixth of them were kept loaded.\nIn that sense, the accident that killed Pittman’s son was like many others. What set it apart, prosecutors said later, was that she should have known better.\nKenney said someone had called the county’s child welfare agency to say Pittman’s children were seen chasing one another through the neighborhood with guns. A social services worker met with her, warned her that it was illegal to leave guns near unsupervised children and offered to buy her a gun safe so she could secure them. Pittman’s response, Kenney said later, was that the county should stay out of her business.\nPittman tells a starkly different story. She said she was never contacted by social services officials and insists she was unaware of the guns in her house, which belonged to her boyfriend. (Kenney said prosecutors did not charge her boyfriend because, unlike Pittman, he did not have a legal duty to keep her kids safe.) Police, prosecutors and the social services office declined to release any records about her son’s death.\nProsecutors throughout the country say deciding whether to bring charges is seldom easy. Parents are suffering, and heaping a criminal prosecution on top of that grief may not do much to teach others to handle their guns more carefully. In some cases, the decision to seek charges can cost the surviving kids their parent.\nKenney did not struggle with her decision.\n“Accidents happen, but this case mandated our charges,” Kenney said. “It’s awful, you don’t bring these charges lightly, but all of this could have been prevented.”\nLess than three months after the shooting, a grand jury indicted Amy Pittman on charges of involuntary manslaughter and three counts of felony child abuse. Pittman, the grand jury said, “willfully and feloniously did kill and slay Christian Pittman.”\nPittman dropped her children with their grandmother and waited at a friend’s house to be arrested. She wouldn’t see them for almost a year and a half.\n___\nPUTTING PARENTS IN JAIL\nJournalists from the USA TODAY Network and the AP spent months using information from the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archive, news reports and police records to examine all of the 152 accidents from 2014 to 2016 in which children under age 12 either killed themselves or were mistakenly shot and killed by another child.\nThe review found that about half of those deaths led to a criminal charge, usually against adults who police and prosecutors say should have watched the children more closely or secured their guns more carefully. The rest of the time, officials decided the grown-ups had broken no laws, or perhaps had simply suffered enough. In many cases, there was little to distinguish those deaths that led to a criminal charge from those that did not.\nFelons were the only exception. Because it is illegal for anyone who has been convicted of a felony to possess a gun, almost every felon involved in an accidental gun death faced criminal charges.\nEven when gun accidents do lead to criminal charges, most parents and guardians still avoid prison. Pittman was one of 50 people to be convicted of a crime following the accidents the news organizations reviewed, although a few cases are pending. Slightly less than half of those people were sentenced to probation; the rest were ordered locked up, typically for about four years.\nFor parents and guardians who are not felons, the stark division in outcomes reflects the struggle prosecutors face after almost any accidental death.\n“You feel an enormous amount of sympathy for these parents because it’s the most unimaginable loss there is when you lose a child. Prosecutors understandably struggle with the deterrent value with filing charges,” said Jennifer Collins, dean of Southern Methodist University Law School, who has studied prosecutions of negligent parents.\nThe same pattern plays out when children drown in swimming pools or suffocate in hot cars. Collins studied such cases a decade ago and found that about half ended in prosecutions; much of the time, prosecutors applied what she called a “suffering discount” as they looked for a balance between deterrence, retribution and mercy.\nThe government’s most recent official count of gun deaths, by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, identified 77 minors who died in gun accidents in 2015, but the AP and USA TODAY counted 146 for that year, including 96 in which a child either shot themselves or another child\nBy either measure, gun accidents account for a small share of children’s deaths in the U.S. About the same number of children die each year in hot cars and poisoning incidents. About five times as many die in fires and 12 times as many drown.\nGun accidents pose a particular challenge for police and prosecutors who must decide whom, if anyone, to hold responsible. One of the reasons why it’s so difficult is that it’s not always clear what criminal charges would accomplish. Prosecutors worry punishment won’t do much to change how other parents keep their guns. And compared with losing a child, the threat of spending a year or two in jail can seem almost inconsequential.\nCasey Mercer sometimes thought about jail in the weeks after his 3-year-old daughter, Alexis, shot herself with a gun he had left on the sofa. But he didn’t fear the idea of being locked up.\n“It’s hard to explain. It was already as bad as it was going to get,” he said.\nMercer kept eight firearms at his home in Lake Charles, Louisiana, midway between Houston and New Orleans. He cleaned them one morning in 2015 before leaving for work, but forgot one, a semi-automatic Glock pistol, on a couch. He texted his girlfriend, Angel Savoy, to put them away before she got home with Alexis.\nIn the time it took Savoy to put the family dog outside, the toddler fired the Glock through her eyelid. Alexis died at the hospital a short time later.\n“It was the most painful thing you can possibly go through,” Mercer said. “I worked with the police; whenever they needed something, I was there. I was worried (about jail), but it wouldn’t have made it different for me.”\nThe sheriff’s investigation eventually made its way to Cynthia Killingsworth, first district attorney for Calcasieu Parish. Largely because of the text message, Killingsworth decided against any charges for Mercer or his girlfriend.\n“What else can I do to those people to have this not happen again?” Killingsworth said. “We’re here to protect society. That’s our job. There’s nothing I could do from a criminal standpoint to make anything change.”\nProsecutors elsewhere have taken a different tack. In Detroit, after a series of high-profile shootings, prosecutors have aggressively sought to charge parents and guardians after gun accidents. The mere presence of an unsecured gun near children is sometimes enough for them to bring criminal charges and the threat of years in prison, assistant county prosecutor Maria Miller said.\n___\n‘I SHOT MY BROTHER’\nThe night Amy Pittman’s son died, she gave her kids chicken nuggets for dinner and told them to take baths before bed. She left her 14-year-old daughter in charge and went out to pick up one of her friends. She said she’d be back within an hour.\nPittman, with brown hair and arms covered with cartoon tattoos, speaks with a raspy, Carolina drawl. She grew up in Durham and left high school at 17 when she became pregnant with her first son. Three different fathers never played a role in parenting her four kids. USA TODAY and the AP are not publishing the names of her surviving children.\nShe worked as a gas station cashier, sometimes overnight to afford the rent on a tiny house on a gravel road that backs up to an industrial warehouse. She saved enough to give her kids shoes and video games on their birthdays. She had racked up speeding and traffic tickets but had been charged with a crime only once, a misdemeanor for selling alcohol to a minor at her job at the convenience store.\nMany days, Pittman finished work at 3 a.m., then stayed awake long enough to help Christian with his homework before school. She made it to the other kids’ basketball games and cross-country meets, but sometimes depended on her father or her boyfriend to make sure they got dinner when she was at work.\nWhile she was gone that evening, Christian’s older brother found the shotgun leaning against the refrigerator. He picked it up, shook it and decided it was unloaded. He later told the police he wanted to play with Christian, so he pointed the gun at the 9-year-old and pulled the trigger.\nThe gun fired. Christian fell. His brother ran into the night, screaming for help.\n“I shot my brother,” he shouted, according to court records. “He’s on the floor. Call. We need help.”\nChristian was dead when detectives arrived.\nPittman arrived home to find police officers crowded inside near Christian’s body. His sister was in a squad car and his brother was at the hospital.\nThat night, after police questioned her, Pittman made her way to Duke University Hospital, where doctors were treating Christian’s older brother, who had been hit in the face by the butt of the shotgun after it went off. She found him holding a plate of pepperoni pizza — Christian’s favorite — that he was saving for his little brother.\n“That was the saddest moment. I had to look at him and tell him his brother didn’t make it,” Pittman said.\nThe shooting left the brother distraught, said Scott Gray, senior pastor at Liberty Baptist Church, where the family prayed each Sunday. The older boy talked about ending his life, too.\n“He fell into my arms and we prayed and cried together,” Gray said about the night of the shooting.\nGray still frequently preaches out of the red, dog-eared Bible Christian received through a church youth group. He used it at the boy’s funeral.\nAt Glenn Elementary, where the boys attended second and fifth grade, Principal Cornelius Redfearn slowly erased Christian from his classroom. The school left his things at his desk for two weeks, then moved his desk away from his classmates, then started taking away his papers, until eventually all of his things were gone.\n___\nKIDS AND GUNS\nProsecutors regularly determine that the combination of kids and unsecured guns isn’t enough of a reason to lock someone up after an accidental death.\nWendy Brock wondered as much on the night her son died in 2015. Still at the hospital in the hours after doctors concluded they could not save the boy, Brock asked the police officer interviewing her an obvious question: “Are we going to jail for this?”\nBrock’s son, Jaxon White, had turned 3 two days earlier. His family celebrated with a party. Sunday was a beautiful day, and the boy was out in the yard of the family’s home in Jefferson, Georgia, about an hour outside Atlanta, riding his four-wheeler and playing with a new bubble machine.\nHis parents, Brock and Roger White Jr., were washing Roger’s pickup in the driveway. The boy climbed in the open driver’s side door, found the handgun his father kept in the center console and stood on the seat.\nHis father, nearby, screamed the boy’s name to tell him to put down the gun, which was pointed up as Jaxon looked down the barrel.\nThen, a loud pop.\nThe boy collapsed from a gunshot wound to the head. His father cradled him in his arms as he screamed for Wendy to call 911. Jaxon was breathing, barely, when medics arrived. His pulse stopped in the ambulance.\nA Jefferson Police Department officer later wrote that White appeared to be delusional and was seen talking to himself, saying “I knew better.” Officers found other guns around the house, including a loaded gun on top of a mirror on a dresser and the loaded revolver Brock kept in her minivan.\nNevertheless, Special Agent Jeremy Burton of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation told him, “You are certainly very careful with where you place your firearms,” but that they would be temporarily taken away for safety reasons, according to a recording of the conversation. Jaxon’s death, Burton said, appeared to be “just an accident, a very terrible accident.”\nDistrict Attorney J. Bradley Smith closed the case without filing charges, citing a lack of criminal intent.\n“While looking in hindsight, additional measures could have been taken to prevent this tragedy, the lack of those measures does not rise to the level of reckless conduct or criminal negligence,” he wrote in a letter to the police. “I see no purpose in punishing this family any further.”\nBrock and White declined to comment; their reactions were captured in police records and recorded interviews with investigators.\nThe boy’s grandmother and Roger’s mother, Sharon White, praised the decision not to file charges, saying the accident had devastated everyone in the family.\n“Could you imagine in that situation, after all that, them charging him and making him go to jail for that?” she said.\nSome states have laws meant to limit children’s access to loaded weapons. But the “child access prevention” rules have run into opposition from gun-rights groups including the National Rifle Association. A spokeswoman for the NRA, Jennifer Baker, said the group opposes “one-size-fits-all government mandates” and believes existing laws are enough to handle gun accidents.\nBoth the NRA and gun-control groups have focused instead on education campaigns that encourage parents to safeguard their weapons.\n___\n‘SHE LOST EVERYTHING’\nPittman pleaded guilty on a Thursday in July 2015. Only her father and her lawyer came with her.\nPittman had told everyone she didn’t know about the guns; all she wished she had done differently, she said, was stay home that night.\n“It weren’t her fault. It weren’t. It was that guy she was living with,” said Pittman’s father, Frankie.\nBut on that day, she faced a judge and said she was ready to accept the blame for Christian’s death.\nDo you know, Judge Paul Gessner asked, that you’re pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter and child abuse?\n“Yes,” she said.\n“Are you in fact guilty?”\n“Yes.”\nShe sat while Kenney, the prosecutor, explained why she belonged in prison. “Egregious” lack of care, she called it.\nGessner sentenced Pittman to two years in prison. With credit for the time she’d already spent in county jail, she would be out in one. But Gessner left little doubt that the sentence signaled the end for Pittman’s family. Her remaining children would go to foster care; she could not communicate with them unless a therapist approved.\n“The effect of this judgment is devastating. The whole thing is devastating,” the judge said.\nPittman’s lawyer, Woodrena Baker-Harrell, said the tragedy of Christian’s death would cost the family far more than a two-year prison sentence. “She’s going to suffer for the rest of her life. Even if she got a life sentence, you can’t punish her more than she is already imposing on herself,” she said. “It’s a mother who just lost her child.”\nNow released, Pittman said her goals are “go to work, save money, stay out of trouble and get my kids back.”\nShe sees her two youngest children only once a month, for an hour, in a neutral location while a social worker keeps watch.\nShe visits Christian more, sitting on the lawn next to the bronze plate with a picture of a teddy bear on a swing that marks his grave. She added his name, surrounded by a pair of wings and a halo, to the collection of tattoos on her arm, a reminder of her youngest child she can carry with her.\nShe also carries the question: “Am I as bad of a mom as they say I am?”\n___\nPenzenstadler reported for USA Today; Foley and Fenn reported for AP.\n___\nContributing to this report: Allen G.

When the framers decided to create a powerful chief executive with a fixed term of office, it was immediately evident that a remedy was needed in case something went terribly wrong. As Virginia delegate George Mason observed early in the deliberations in Philadelphia, “some mode of displacing an unfit magistrate is rendered indispensable by the fallibility of those who choose, as well as by the corruptibility of the man chosen.” The framers all agreed that the power to remove the executive would have to be lodged somewhere. They had more difficulty agreeing on who should control the removal power and on what basis it should be exercised.\nThere were essentially two options on the table. The president might be removable by either the state governments or by Congress. There was little interest among the nationalists who were working to rewrite the federal constitution in giving the states that kind of power over a branch of the national government, and so they quickly settled on giving the power to Congress. If Congress would have the authority to remove the president, it could either be done by impeachment or by what is sometimes known as “removal by address.” Impeachment was understood to require that a specific cause for removal be specified and a trial be held to determine whether the officer was guilty of those charges. Removal by address was a simpler process that merely required a vote with no necessity that specific charges be made or proven or that a fair hearing be provided. Because the framers valued the independence of the three branches of government and did not want the president to be at the mercy of a hostile legislature, they preferred the route of impeachment.\nThe constitutional text sets down both a procedure to be followed for impeachments and a substantive standard by which impeachments should be judged. Procedurally, an impeachment can be brought by a majority vote of the House of Representatives against any civil officer of the federal government. In practice, the House investigates whether impeachment charges would be warranted. If it determines that charges are warranted, articles of impeachment are drafted that specify the various charges against the officer in question and those are voted on by the whole House. Once the Senate receives articles of impeachment from the House, it organizes itself into a court. Senators take an oath to do “impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws” when sitting as judges in that court, and the chief justice of the United States presides over the court in the case of an impeachment of the president. The House appoints managers to prosecute the case before the Senate, and the impeached officer is entitled to present a defense. At the conclusion of the trial, the members of the Senate must vote on each individual article of impeachment. Conviction requires a guilty verdict from two-thirds of the participating senators. Upon conviction, the Senate may impose a punishment of removal from office or disqualification from any future federal office.\nMere incompetence or “maladministration” is not generally understood to be an impeachable offense.\nSubstantively, the Constitution specifies that impeachments can be brought for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” The phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” is borrowed from British parliamentary practice, but it does not have a settled or clear meaning. The constitutional drafters were searching for a standard that was flexible and would allow removal in a variety of situations as circumstances might dictate. But they also wanted a standard that required some specific, demonstrable offenses to have been committed before Congress would be able to remove members of the other branches of government.\nWhile he was still a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Gerald Ford famously quipped that “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.” This is true in the sense that the Senate is the only court that can ever rule on the appropriateness of the House’s actions, and so if the Senate is willing to sustain an impeachment charge then it is for all practical purposes an impeachable offense.\nNonetheless, neither the constitutional framers nor the senators who have sat in impeachment trials have taken the view that Congress has complete discretion over the scope of impeachable offenses. In particular, the requirement that an officer must commit a specific high crime or misdemeanor to justify an impeachment has generally been understood to mean that mere policy disagreement, incompetence, innocent mistakes, or “maladministration” would not be an impeachable offense. Defendants in impeachment trials have an incentive to argue that the scope of impeachable offenses should be narrowly construed. If they are charged with private criminal behavior, they have argued that impeachable offenses must be limited to abuses of office. If they have been charged with abuses of office, they have argued that impeachable offenses must be limited to violations of the criminal law.\nThe House and Senate have generally taken a broader view of the impeachment power. If an officer has committed specific and serious bad acts that are fundamentally inconsistent with the requirements of their office or the expectations of the public trust, then the House and Senate have tended to be open to evaluating those as potentially impeachable offenses.\nThe history of federal impeachments has been fairly sparse. Across its entire history, the House has only passed articles of impeachment in 19 cases. In four of those cases, the individual left office before a verdict was rendered. The other cases are almost equally split between convictions and acquittals. In many cases where an impeachment might have been warranted, it was avoided. Cabinet members and lower-level executive officers either resign or are removed by the president when a sufficiently grave scandal erupts. Legislators resign, are expelled by their chamber, or are defeated in election. As a consequence, the history of federal impeachments is mostly a history of congressional investigations of federal judges and presidents. Most impeachments of federal judges have involved relatively pedestrian charges of unethical or criminal behavior. Congress has found itself pushed into action when judges with lifetime tenure face serious public scandals, and sometimes jail time, and yet refuse to voluntarily step down from the bench.\nIn many ways, the most discretionary impeachments have been those involving high-ranking officials, namely presidents and Supreme Court justices. Presidents and justices sometimes stumble into personal or political scandal, but those scandals are soon swept up into broader political debates. As a result, the fact and seriousness of their offenses are more disputed, and more legislators are willing to regard those offenses as tolerable. Even in hindsight, the handful of impeachment proceedings against justices and presidents has remained controversial. The one instance in which there was eventually some bipartisan agreement that impeachable offenses had been committed came out of Watergate, and in that case President Richard Nixon resigned rather than face likely impeachment and removal.\nUndertaking a presidential impeachment is no small matter, and it should not be approached as if it were simply a technical application of the law. An impeachment will dominate the political agenda for months and throw the government into disarray. An unsuccessful effort to remove a president will leave the White House damaged and enfeebled. If supporters of the president are not persuaded that the impeachment effort was justified, it will escalate partisan tensions and feed distrust of American political institutions. Congress has a responsibility to pursue less drastic measures to address the perceived problems when it can. If an impeachment inquiry becomes unavoidable, political leaders on both sides of the aisle will have a duty to work together to find ways to overcome the resulting civil strife and put the nation on a stronger footing as it faces the challenges ahead."},{"url":"https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-05-16/violent-crime-rates-caribbean-among-highest-earth-study-shows","title":"Violent crime rates in the Caribbean among the highest on Earth, study shows","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Public Radio International","description":"The study out Tuesday by the Interamerican Development Bank is based on a survey of 3,000 crime victims in each of five countries: the Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica and Suriname.","date":"","full_text":"8627179488_cfb43618e0_o.jpg\nCredit:\nBlkmgkwmn/CC BY 2.0 (image cropped)\nThe Caribbean and its pristine beaches may be a tourist magnet, but life in paradise comes at a price: the soaring violent crime rate is higher than in Latin America or Africa.\nThe study out Tuesday by the Interamerican Development Bank is based on a survey of 3,000 crime victims in each of five countries: the Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica and Suriname.\nWhile the nonviolent crime rate is low, violent crime rates \"are among the highest in the world,\" the report says.\n\"Nearly one in three said they had lost someone to violence.

That could take the form of a simple block grant that doesn’t adjust to population changes or a per capita allocation, which would base payments on the number of state residents who fall into particular categories, like poor children or disabled adults.\nPayments would rise each year, but only at the inflation rate for medical care services. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that will be less than the actual growth in enrollees’ costs between now and 2026, creating a growing gap.\nOver the next few decades, the problem will get even worse as boomers go from “young-old” to “old-old.” Between 2015 and 2060, the Census predicts that the population aged 65 to 84 will grow 89 percent. Meanwhile, the number of people 85 and older will more than triple. It’s those older seniors who are most likely to need long-term care. But the “elderly” category in the House plan lumps everyone over 65 together, setting the baseline for per-capita costs based on the population mix in 2016, which is much more heavily weighted toward younger, healthier seniors.\nThe way the bill sets the baseline, it also entrenches decisions many states have made to try to keep their costs down. States that offered stingy benefits in 2016 would be forced to keep doing so, unless they can find all the money for expansion in their own budgets.\n“When you put these kinds of lids on spending, and given the constrained spending we’ve had before, what you’re doing is freezing in place gross inequities across states,” Feder said. “Essentially you’re denying federal resources that would enable low-spending states to catch up.”\nRhonda Richards, a senior legislative representative at AARP, said states that don’t have the money to pay for the care their older residents’ needs might tighten their eligibility rules. That would leave more people without any care at all. Or they might reduce the rates they pay providers ― even though Medicaid already generally pays less than Medicare or private insurance for a given service. Richards said that could have a big impact on nursing homes and other facilities.\n“Certain providers might decide not to provide services whose care is being paid for by Medicaid,” she said. “It could also impact the quality of care that’s provided.”\nThe bill would be even worse for home health and community-based long-term care. The federal government requires state Medicaid programs to cover residential facilities, but not the kinds of care that let people keep living in their own homes. Faced with less money to go around, this might well be the easiest place to make cuts.\n“We’re really focused on the impact this has on older adults’ ability to live independently in their homes and communities,” Richards said.\nGetting care at home is much cheaper than moving to a nursing home, and most people prefer it. But Feder said states have been slow to cover home and community care precisely because they’re so popular that the programs can be overwhelmed with demand ― unlike with nursing homes, which are almost always a last resort.\n“The concern that states have had is it will serve more people,” she said. “That’s the objective, but that has made them reluctant.”\nUnder the Republican health bill, rather than continue to slowly expand coverage for home and community health, states would be likely to roll it back.\nUltimately, the single biggest problem facing the long-term care system, and American health care at large, is that health services are expensive. The conservatives seeking to cut Medicaid have been denouncing it as an “out of control” entitlement for decades. And, indeed, under current law the program is expected to be 2 ½ times bigger in 2025 than it was in 2009. But private health insurance spending is growing nearly as fast.\nRegardless of politics, people will need more help as they get older. If authorities cut the spending that lets seniors get that help, the burden will fall elsewhere, often on family members who end up overburdened and financially strained. And, of course, some seniors simply won’t have anyone willing or able to help them for free.\nLawmakers ― including Republicans ― know this. It’s the reason Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), one of the last holdouts before the House bill passed, expressed strong reservations. He only relented when the Trump administration assured him that they were “committed to find a solution” to keep nursing home care fully funded.\nAs the Senate drafts its own Affordable Care Act replacement bill, we’ll find out just how seriously the Republican Party takes the notion that this is a problem that needs to be solved."},{"url":"http://www.startribune.com/after-unexpected-delay-splashier-children-s-museum-will-reopen-soon-with-3-ticket-hike/422754864","title":"After unexpected delay, splashier Children's Museum will reopen next month","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Star Tribune","description":"The $30 million makeover and expansion will go public on June 2, with a grand opening celebration to follow a few days later.","date":"","full_text":"The Minnesota Children’s Museum, beset by an unexpected delay in its $30 million renovation, finally has a firm date for its delayed reopening.\nThe public can access the museum June 2-6 for a reservation-only sneak peek before a grand reopening June 7.\nThe museum, which had been closed since December and is now 35 percent larger, also announced an increase in ticket prices: General admission tickets jumped $3 to $12.95; annual membership plans range from $129 to $189 up from previous plans, which started at $99.\nThe museum, on W. 7th Street in St. Paul, had targeted April to unveil 10 new exhibits, a rooftop terrace, outdoor space, a new cafe and store.

Republicans were set to blow up a historic Senate rule so they could bust through a Democratic blockade and confirm Neil Gorsuch for the US Supreme Court with just a majority vote.\nRather than the usual milling around at vote time, when senators from both parties mix it up with slaps on the back and chitchat, many members began the series of votes on this April morning sitting quietly at their desks. Republicans on one side, Democrats on the other.\nWhich is why Sen. Susan Collins stood out. Carrying a bright green folder, the Republican from Maine crisscrossed the chamber floor, quietly approaching her colleagues – placing her hand on a shoulder, bending down to whisper, then opening her folder.\nEven as the Senate was “nuking” the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominations – a high bar meant to forge consensus and protect minority-party rights – Senator Collins was gathering signatures for a bipartisan letter to the Senate leadership. The petition sought to preserve the chamber’s last supermajority threshold – not for court appointments but for passing legislation itself.\nThis was classic Collins, ranked in 2015 as the most bipartisan of the Senate. Such moderation actually makes her a particularly powerful senator. In this increasingly polarized era, Collins is a crucial swing vote in a chamber where Republicans hold only a tenuous 52-to-48 majority, putting her in a position to help shape or stall the legislative agenda of President Trump.\nWhen it comes down to it, experts say, the Trump revolution will largely succeed or fail in the Senate, depending on lawmakers like Collins and various constellations of members that shift with the issues. Trying to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, as well as dealing with issues such as tax reform, infrastructure spending, and the federal budget, will require a careful corralling of senators – even as powerful forces, such as elections, tug at lawmakers’ political ids.\n“The crux of the Trump agenda begins and ends with that body,” says Jim Manley, former spokesman for retired Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada.\nOf course, there are caveats to the Senate being the arbiter of the Trump presidency. One is the White House itself: Can this politically inexperienced administration unify its message and learn to engage more successfully with Congress? And what about the mercurial and fractious Republicans in the House?\nStill, it is generally the Senate – with its traditions and rules that enhance the individual power of each of its 100 members – that will shape much of what happens in the next four years, rather than the much larger House, where the majority rules. The tight divide in the Senate complicates matters. When Senate rules require a simple majority vote, Republicans can afford at most two defections. When the rules require a 60-vote threshold, as they still do for spending bills and most major legislation, Republicans – if they hang together – will need eight Democrats.\nHow much ultimately gets done will hinge in large part on the Senate’s two Kasparov-like chess masters – majority leader Mitch McConnell (R) of Kentucky and minority leader Charles Schumer (D) of New York. But behind them are a number of coalition builders and busters who will play crucial roles, including these six, who range from a rookie Californian to an octogenarian songwriter.\nSusan Collins: Courting a moderate\nCollins is a fifth-generation public servant who draws inspiration from Maine’s first female US senator, Margaret Chase Smith, and from her political lineage. Both her parents served as mayor of her hometown of Caribou, on the northeastern tip of Maine, where her family runs a lumber business that dates back to 1844.\nThe state has a tradition of sending independent-minded senators to Washington, and the moderate Republican carries on that tradition. It’s what makes her one of the most wooed members of the chamber.\n“Not a day goes by that I do not hear from a colleague in the Senate, asking me to either join in an initiative, or what I will do on a particular issue,” she says in an interview. “That’s very nice in some ways, but it puts a lot of pressure on me,” especially now that the president is a member of her own party, she explains.\nStill, that hasn’t changed her approach to her work: searching for compromise when she can, checking the president when she feels she must.\nThough she did not vote for Mr. Trump in November, she stood with him on the Gorsuch nomination after having tried – and failed – to broker a bipartisan truce to avoid the explosive rules change. But she did not support Trump’s choice for Education secretary, Betsy DeVos.\nCollins has deep reservations about the GOP plan to overhaul Obamacare that narrowly passed the House May 4, saying it would hurt Mainers, particularly senior citizens. She and several other Republican senators have made it clear the bill will never survive the Senate intact. Their message helped stall it in the GOP-controlled House in March.\nBefore the House even unveiled its plan, she and a Republican colleague, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician, wrote their own compromise bill: States that like Obamacare could keep it; those that don’t could use Affordable Care Act funds to develop a plan that covers more people. They've picked up four Republican co-sponsors and are reaching out to Democrats.\nCollins says the president called her about the bill. He found it intriguing and sent White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and an assistant to talk to her and Senator Cassidy about the specifics.\nIn the end, though, the administration backed the House version. It aimed to pass it through a special budget maneuver that requires only a majority vote in each chamber.\nAs a steadfast defender of the Senate’s deliberative traditions – Collins herself has never missed a vote in her 20-year tenure – she is skeptical of circumventing the normal legislative path for such big and complex issues as health care and tax reform. She prefers the committee process, hearings, and amendments in which the House and Senate have a chance to work their will and come to some kind of bipartisan solution.\n“I don’t think this is a good way to proceed, and I would think we would have learned from [Obamacare] when President Obama jammed the bill through the Senate,” she says.\nThe GOP leadership in the Senate has meanwhile set up a working group of 13 Republicans to fashion the Senate's own Republican health-care bill. Neither Cassidy nor Collins is on it – and notably, no women either. At least one former Washington insider suggests that Senate leaders should consult closely with the even-tempered Collins, not just because she is a crucial swing vote, but because she also serves on some powerful committees, including appropriations.\n“I used to work very closely with Susan every day. And the same thing with Olympia Snowe,” says former Senate majority leader Trent Lott (R) of Mississippi, referring to Collins’s former colleague from Maine. “If you get them in on the takeoff, they’ll probably be there on the landing.”\nYet there is some question whether Collins will even be in the Senate in a few years. She is weighing a 2018 bid for governor. The deciding factor, she has said, is where she can “do the most good” for Maine.\nWhen Trump gave his first address to a joint session of Congress in February, most Democrats sat stone-faced or clapped politely in their laps. Not Sen. Joe Manchin (D) of West Virginia – an ultra-red state that Trump won by more than 40 percentage points. Like a jack-in-the-box, the West Virginian kept popping up to applaud.\nPolitical analysts point to Senator Manchin and nine other red-state Democrats up for reelection in 2018 as a possible source of votes for Trump’s priorities. These are relative moderates who – like Collins – could turn out to be key swing votes.\n“The Senate in some respects belongs to Joe Manchin and Susan Collins,” says John Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif.\nManchin hates it when reporters bring up his looming race as a possible factor in his votes and friendly relations with the president. It doesn’t weigh “one iota” in his decisions, he tells a scrum of reporters. He’s simply representing his state. And as a former governor, he’s showing deference to Trump as a fellow executive.\nWhile many of Manchin’s colleagues have put up a wall of resistance to the president, the West Virginian was one of three Democrats who voted to confirm Mr. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He has also voted to approve several of Trump’s most controversial cabinet nominees, such as former Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary, and Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). He has the most conservative voting record of Senate Democrats.\nManchin disagrees with Trump on health care, but he comes from a coal state and has railed against EPA over-regulation. (He keeps a bronze statue of a coal miner in his office.) The crosscurrents he is facing are similar to those confronting Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D) of North Dakota – also an energy state and one that Trump won by more than 35 points.\nBoth Manchin and Senator Heitkamp trekked to Trump Tower for a visit with then-President-elect Trump and were invited to the White House with a small group of moderate Democratic senators early in his administration. Manchin feels he can call the president at any time, as he did recently to get his support for health care for miners.\nIn six weeks, “I spoke ... with this White House and this president more than I did with the other president in six years,” he says, referring to Barack Obama.\nWhen minority leader Schumer announced his new leadership team last year, Manchin was designated as the Democrats’ outreach guy to Republicans.\nBut the West Virginian says there hasn’t been much to reach out about yet. The GOP has been focused on nominations or other issues – such as health care and regulation rollbacks – that have only required a majority vote. Presumably, that will change now that Congress is moving into budgeting and other legislating that will require bipartisan support to clear the Senate.\n“If this place is going to work, you’re going to have to look at 10 or 12 Democrats,” says Manchin, striding from the Capitol to his office on a gloriously warm spring day. He is a tall man, with a thick shock of salt-and-pepper hair, who lives on a houseboat when he’s in Washington.\nRepublicans will have to bring in moderates, he continues, and “get off this hard-line thinking that everybody else has got to bow to them because they’re the majority.”\nThe question is whether Democratic moderates will play. At the start of the year, Republicans seemed confident they would get enough Democrats to back Gorsuch to clear a 60-vote threshold. In the end, only three Democrats, all red-staters, voted to confirm him.\n“They can’t count on red-state Democrats coming to them just out of fear of defeat,” says Ross Baker, an expert on the Senate at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.\nOrrin Hatch: Writing a Trump ballad?\nOne of Trump’s indispensable allies on the Hill is Orrin Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate. The octogenarian, who admiringly calls the president “a shrewd cookie,” chairs the Senate Finance Committee. Almost everything Trump cares about runs through that panel: tax reform, infrastructure, trade, and revisions to health care.\n“Any way you slice it, Orrin Hatch will be a key player,” says former GOP majority leader Mr. Lott.\nOn taxes, Senator Hatch is conferring regularly with the top GOP tax writer in the House and with the Trump administration. This is a hugely complex issue, he tells reporters, “even more complex than health care.” It will test his 40-plus years as a legislator – and his ability to create harmony out of discord.\nRepublicans are divided over tax reform. While they generally agree on the president’s broad goals of a simpler code, lower business taxes, and a middle-class tax cut, they disagree over details – especially how to pay for it all. Hatch and other Republicans, for instance, doubt the president’s proposed low corporate tax rate of 15 percent will make it through Congress.\nThis internal division does not bode well for the party’s strategy on pushing through an overhaul. As with repealing Obamacare, the GOP plan is to use a special budgetary procedure to pass a tax bill with only a majority vote.\nRepublicans found out how tough that was with their health-care bill. So might they try a more bipartisan strategy? That was the road to the last big tax overhaul in 1986.\nDespite his deep conservatism, Hatch is also known for his bipartisan work – and friendship – with the liberal lion from Massachusetts, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. Hatch even wrote a love song, “Souls Along the Way,” for Senator Kennedy and his wife, Vicki, that was featured in the film “Ocean’s Twelve.”\nThe senator is an established songwriter, including one he scratched out during a committee hearing, with gold and platinum albums to his name.\nSome wonder whether this could be a Kennedyesque moment for Hatch – a time to come together with the lead Democrat on his committee, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. The two have worked well together in the past, for instance, on trade.\n“Oh yeah,” Hatch said in a recent interview. “I intend to work with him, and I intend to work with House Democrats as well,” he said, rumbling toward his office on one of the Capitol subway trains. However, he lamented, “I wish we had more Democrats in the House and Senate who [were] more willing to work with us.”\nSenator Wyden’s affection for Hatch is mutual. “We’re former basketball players,” says the 6-foot-4 Wyden about his 6-foot-2 colleague. “We like telling stories. He sort of treats me like I’m his kid, and I’m very fond of him.”\nHowever – and this is the key complaint of Wyden – for something as serious and difficult as tax reform, Democrats need to be consulted from the “get-go.” When Republicans go off on their own, write the bill they want, and then try to round up some Democrats if they need them, that’s not bipartisanship, he says.\nYet Democrats are playing tough, too. They demanded that Trump release his tax returns as part of any tax overhaul. When the White House outlined Trump's tax reform plan April 26, Wyden denounced it as offering “crumbs” to working people and “cakes to the fortunate few.”\nHatch reminisces that it was Kennedy who, early on, came to him. The committees at that time were almost all chaired by Southern Democrats who did not have a very high opinion of the senator from Massachusetts – though they did like Hatch.\n“Kennedy was wise enough to realize that, ‘hey, I might be able to get something done with Orrin,’ and as you know, we passed all kinds of important legislation.”\nBut as Hatch so often comments these days, the Senate isn’t what it used to be. He sounds like Manchin, but with the GOP perspective: “The question is whether we can get the Democrats to work with us – to get off the kick that Hillary should have won.”\nJohn McCain and Lindsey Graham: birds of a feather\nIt was a tender scene: Sen. John McCain wiping his eyes as his close friend Sen. Lindsey Graham sang his praises at a CNN town hall in March. “I love him to death,” said Senator Graham, who then dabbed his own eyes.\nThey were acting like a couple of lovebirds in that moment, but usually these two are fierce defense hawks, with Senator McCain of Arizona chairing the Armed Services Committee and Graham of South Carolina, also on the committee, as his wingman.\nDuring the presidential campaign and into Trump’s presidency, the two senators regularly clashed with the commander in chief – criticizing him about Russia and his “America first” policy that seemed to vacate the country’s leadership in the world.\nThe two were shaping up to be formidable opponents of the president’s stances on foreign affairs. That is, until Trump in April ordered a barrage of Tomahawk cruise missiles to rain down on a Syrian airbase in response to a chemical weapons attack. Both men immediately released a supportive joint statement: “Unlike the previous administration, President Trump confronted a pivotal moment in Syria and took action.”\nThe plaudits from both men have been flowing since then. April turned into a month of muscle flexing, with the US dropping the “mother of all bombs” on Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan and taking a tough stance on North Korea.\n“I am like the happiest dude in America right now,” Graham told “Fox \u0026 Friends” on April 19. “We have got a president and a national security team that I’ve been dreaming of for eight years.”\nThe senator said North Korea and China should start thinking anew about Trump. “I am all in. Keep it up, Donald,” he said.\nAll in? Perhaps for now, but it is not clear whether the president will go far enough over the course of his presidency to satisfy this duo – or other hawks in Congress.\nTrump wants an increase of $54 billion in defense spending for 2018. McCain and his House counterpart want far more and vow to defend State Department funding. Last week, McCain took to the opinion pages of the New York Times to lambaste Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for giving short shrift to defending human rights around the globe.\nMilitarily, the president authorized one strike on one airfield in Syria. But McCain and Graham want the Syrian Air Force completely grounded, more support for vetted opposition fighters, and a no-fly zone over Syria.\n“The only thing they understand is force,” McCain told reporters, speaking of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nOnly four months in the Senate and Kamala Harris is already telling Californians she’s got “bloody knuckles” from fighting Trump.\nIt’s rhetorical flourish, true, but there’s no question that the Golden State’s freshman senator has started off fiercely opposing the president. When Senate Democrats say they’re the “emergency brake” on the Trump administration, that includes members such as Senator Harris – considered a rising star in the party, and sometimes mentioned as a possible 2020 presidential or vice presidential candidate.\n“Within days of being sworn in, she was smart enough to disregard the old rules about freshman senators [being] seen and not heard,” says Mr. Manley, the former spokesman for Mr. Reid.\nThere she was, a featured speaker at the Women’s March on Washington, then joining protesters against the president’s travel ban, and aggressively questioning his cabinet choices at hearings. She jumped to the defense of Sen. Elizabeth Warren after majority leader McConnell shut down the floor speech of the Massachusetts Democrat for impugning a colleague – Republican Senator Sessions, who went on to become attorney general.\n“We need to watch this Jeff Sessions,” said Harris at a recent town hall in Los Angeles. Questioning Mr. Sessions's objectivity, Harris said last week he should resign over the firing of FBI Director James Comey.\nThe question is what the Democrats, as the minority party, can do other than just watch. They couldn’t block the president’s Supreme Court nominee nor his cabinet picks, though they did manage to build enough momentum against fast-food executive Andy Puzder that he withdrew from consideration as Labor secretary.\nDemocrats, however, are not without power, especially in the Senate, where they can still threaten to block legislation and use rules to delay things. Now that Congress is addressing spending issues – its main job – Democrats can throw up a 60-vote barrier.\nSo when Harris promised folks – to rapturous cheers – at her town hall that she would do all she could to block a budget if it included money for the president’s border wall, that wasn’t an idle threat. The wall didn’t make it into this year’s budget.\nStill, it would be a mistake to think of her as a flat-out “resister” to all things Trump. Harris says she is defending the interests of her state – one that voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, has more unauthorized immigrants than any other state, leads the country in the number of people covered by Obamacare, and is at the forefront of the fight against climate change.\nAt the same time, the senator is willing to work with the Trump administration on such issues as infrastructure and disaster relief – perennial needs in her state. And she has urged progressive activists to rally behind, rather than protest, vulnerable conservative Democrats such as Manchin and Heitkamp.\nFollow Stories Like This\nSign Up\n“She is more practical than her reputation suggests,” says Professor Pitney. As for her “stardom,” Pitney describes her as “new and fresh” compared with the senior set of Democratic power brokers in Washington.\nHarris is the first Indian-American and second African-American woman to serve in the Senate (her parents came from India and Jamaica). Growing up in Berkeley, Calif., she attended civil rights marches with her parents. Though her progressive roots run deep, some liberals think she was too cautious on criminal justice and other reforms while she was California’s attorney general."},{"url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/17/pesticide-trump-ban-california-farm-workers-sick","title":"Pesticide that Trump's EPA refused to ban blamed for sickening farm workers","author_text":"Oliver Milman","keywords":["Pesticides","Trump Administration","California","Environment","Farming","Us News"],"publication_text":"the Guardian","description":"Nearly 50 farm workers experienced nausea and vomiting apparently caused by a pesticide whose scheduled ban was overturned by the Trump administration","date":"2017-05-17","full_text":"A pesticide that was set to be banned before the Trump administration reversed course has been blamed for causing sickness to nearly 50 farm workers who were exposed to the chemical in California.\nSpraying of Vulcan, a brand name chemical, on an orchard southwest of Bakersfield led to the pesticide drifting to a neighboring property operated by Dan Andrews Farms. A total of 47 farm workers were harvesting cabbage at the time and subsequently complained of a bad odor, nausea and vomiting. One was taken to hospital with four other workers visiting doctors in the following days.\nGlenn Fankhauser, agricultural commissioner of Kern County, said samples of cabbage and clothing have been taken to the state lab for testing. The tests are still underway to confirm the cause but the primary ingredient of Vulcan is chlorpyrifos, a toxic pesticide that was on course to be banned by the Obama administration before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided against implementing a ban in March.\nDan Andrews, who runs the eponymous farm, said he doesn’t use chlorpyrifos despite it apparently infecting his workers.\n“Unfortunately the wind moved it onto us, I’m not quite sure how it happened, thank God everyone’s OK,” he told Guardian US. “There were quite a few people feeling sick, some of them vomited, so we shut down the harvest.\n“We are waiting for the investigation to conclude but I think they should ban (chlorpyrifos) to remove what’s causing the nausea. If it has had a history of incidents then it should be revisited and removed. Usually you worry about your own ranch, you don’t want to worry about other ranches. We are going to have to do due diligence before our shifts now.”\nChlorpyrifos is widely used in US agriculture, sprayed on crops such as corn, wheat and citrus. However, growing evidence of its impact upon human health led the EPAto agree with the chemical industry more than a decade ago that the product should not be used indoors to get rid of household bugs.\nThe pesticide has been linked to developmental problems in children such as lower birth weight, reduced IQ and attention disorders. Large doses of the chemical can cause convulsions and sometimes even death. People are exposed through spray drift, residues on food and water contamination.\nChlorpyrifos, which is produced by Dow Chemicals, can still be used for agricultural purposes but after a legal challenge by environmental groups, EPA scientists stated that the pesticide was not safe for any use and proposed widening the ban.\nA subsequent ban of chlorpyrifos was rejected, however, under the new Trump administration. Scott Pruitt, administrator of the EPA, said he denied the ban to provide “regulatory certainty to the thousands of American farms that rely on chlorpyrifos”. The EPA said there were “serious scientific concerns and substantive process gaps” in the plan to banish chlorpyrifos. The next review of the chemical isn’t scheduled until 2022.\nFarmworker Justice, a group that advocates on behalf of agricultural employees, said the EPA has become too close to large chemical companies such as Dow.\n“We were extremely disappointed with the EPA’s decision but the administration received a lot of pressure from industry and donors,” said Virginia Ruiz, director of occupational and environmental health at Farmworker Justice. “I don’t have much confidence that the current administration will end the use of chlorpyrifos.”\nRuiz added: “These are the incidents we are afraid of because workers and their kids are particularly vulnerable to the effects of this pesticide. It’s not just the acute incidents but also low level exposures that are harmful to children. It’s a double standard to expect farm workers to be exposed to something that’s banned from homes.”"},{"url":"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/06/the_roots_of_policing_sir_robe.html#0","title":"The roots of policing: Sir Robert Peel's 9 principles","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"cleveland.com","description":"A look at the 9 principles that date back 190 years that were the foundation of modern policing.","date":"","full_text":"Click through the principles in the slideshow and let us know what you think.\nAs for Peel, he went on to found England's Conservative Party and twice serve as Prime Minister, as well.\nThe basic mission for which police exist is to prevent crime and disorder as an alternative to the repression of crime and disorder by military force and severity of legal punishment.\nThe ability of the police to perform their duties is dependent upon public approval of police existence, actions, behavior and the ability of the police to secure and maintain public respect.\nThe police must secure the willing cooperation of the public in voluntary observance of the law to be able to secure and maintain public respect.\nThe police seek and preserve public favor, not by catering to public opinion, but by constantly demonstrating absolutely impartial service to the law, in complete independence of policy, and without regard to the justice or injustice of the substance of individual laws; by ready offering of individual service and friendship to all members of society without regard to their race or social standing, by ready exercise of courtesy and friendly good humor; and by ready offering of individual sacrifice in protecting and preserving life.\nThe police should use physical force to the extent necessary to secure observance of the law or to restore order only when the exercise of persuasion, advice and warning is found to be insufficient to achieve police objectives; and police should use only the minimum degree of physical force which is necessary on any particular occasion for achieving a police objective.\nThe police at all times should maintain a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and the public are the police; the police are the only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the intent of the community welfare.\nThe police should always direct their actions toward their functions and never appear to usurp the powers of the judiciary by avenging individuals or the state, or authoritatively judging guilt or punishing the guilty."},{"url":"http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2017/05/30/daisy-dog-lab-ring-bearer-wedding/354414001","title":"Awww!

It’s Not As Far-Fetched As You May Think","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"NationSwell","description":"Meet the people renewing America at NationSwell. http://www.nationswell.com","date":"2017-02-09","full_text":"The house in Boulder, Colo., was beautiful. The floors were cork, the carpets were made of recycled plastic bottles — the whole place was being redone on sustainable, environmental principles. “It was mind-expanding,” says Jason Ballard, the co-founder and CEO of eco-friendly home improvement retailer TreeHouse. The house belonged to Ballard’s instructor in a wilderness EMT program. Ballard was staying there shortly after college, and he was inspired by his instructor’s efforts to remodel his home to make it more environmentally friendly. “It was such a lovely vision of what was possible,” he says.\nBut the more Ballard learned about sustainable home improvement, the more he realized how difficult it was to find attractive, well-designed products. That insight — and that vision of what was possible in the home — led Ballard to create TreeHouse, a company that’s aimed at transforming the home improvement market and, with it, the home itself. Among the wares and services available are recycled glass countertops, electric lawn tools and solar-panel installation. Ballard says customers often call his company “the Whole Foods of home improvement — and it’s not too far from the truth.”\nBallard has always had an eco-conscious mindset. His grandfather was an early role model. “He wouldn’t have called himself a conservationist,” Ballard says, “but he gave me both a conservation ethic and a tremendous sense of wonder about the natural world.” He studied conservation biology in college, where he started to learn about the enormous impact our homes have on the environment. “All we hear about on TV is gas-guzzling SUVs,” he says, “but the real problem is the buildings we’re living in every day.”\nPrivate residences are the biggest users of energy, the biggest users of renewable and nonrenewable materials, the biggest producers of landfill waste and the second-biggest users of water. Most exposure to toxins also takes place in the home. “I realized that if I wanted to make an impact with regard to these existentially challenging issues, then the best area for me to focus on was, in fact, the home,” says Ballard, who’s currently completing a Social Impact Fellowship with GLG, a membership-based learning platform. Through GLG, Jason and his team have learned about inventory management, retail strategy, in-store user experience and customer data management to help the company implement best practices across multiple locations.\nLearn more about the GLG Social Impact Fellowship, including information on applying.\nAfter college, Ballard worked in green building for a while, learning all he could about the market. “What I noticed was that everyone had the same set of problems,” he says. It was hard to find sustainable products, and when he did find them, they were expensive, and only available from a few boutique companies. “The obvious blocker to the whole industry moving forward is access to products at a decent rate, and with some level of curation and education around those products,” Ballard says.\nTreeHouse is built on a few core ideas. First, Ballard says, most home improvement products are terrible — poor quality, toxic and unsustainable. Second, most home improvement services aren’t very good, either. Anyone who’s ever embarked on such a project knows that they’re often delayed and routinely run over budget. The industry also hasn’t gone digital yet, making it difficult to get information on the status of your project when you want it. “The whole experience around home improvement needs to be reimagined,” Ballard says. “We are now trying to make not just the products great, but the technology great and the service great.”\nTreeHouse aims to make sustainable options appeal to more than just die-hard environmentalists. “If we want healthy and sustainable homes to be the norm, they have to be better than conventional homes. And everything around the process has to be better,” Ballard emphasizes. That’s part of why he decided to start a for-profit company to accomplish his environmental goals. “If you’re in a for-profit business, all of your assumptions are tested all the time,” he says. “It forces you to very quickly arrive at what works to affect change.”\nBallard has ambitious goals for TreeHouse. Today, the company has one brick-and-mortar store in Austin, Texas, and is opening two more this year, including one in Dallas. Within the next two years, he plans on opening still more stores, and expanding beyond Texas. Right now, TreeHouse touches only a tiny fraction of the 80 to 100 million homes in the country, Ballard says. He believes 20 stores — a benchmark he hopes to hit in five years — would drive that figure up to 10 percent. The ultimate goal: Launch 300 stores nationwide to reach 80 percent of all the homes in the U.S.\n“Our plan is to run hard at those milestones,” Ballard says. “We don’t have a thousand years to figure this out. We are making decisions in the next hundred years as a species that we will have to live with for the next two thousand years.”\n______\nGLG Social Impact is an initiative of GLG to advance learning and decision-making among distinguished nonprofit and social enterprise leaders.

There is concern from all parties involved in the mediation process that preemptive actions in advance of these discussions would be counterproductive,\" according to an emailed statement Monday. The Walker declined further interviews.\nBefore the meeting with the Walker and Park Board, Dakota elders will hold a meeting Tuesday night to include more of the Dakota community in the discussion. That discussion, at All My Relations Gallery in Minneapolis, is \"only the first of many meetings to help create a process of healing and to help educate through Dakota truth-telling of our own history,\" according to a statement from Dakota elders that the Walker and Park Board included in the Monday email.\nThe Walker said over the weekend the artist and the museum are open to dismantling and removing the work. But artist Sam Durant did not specifically address that in a statement posted to the Walker's web site Monday afternoon. Durant said he made a \"grave miscalculation\" in how the work would be received and apologized for not consulting with the Dakota community.\n\"My work was created with the idea of creating a zone of discomfort for whites; your protests have now created a zone of discomfort for me,\" the letter said. \"In my attempt to raise awareness I have learned something profound, and I thank you for that.

Here’s why it shouldn’t be.","date":"2017-04-25","full_text":"I’m going to preface this with a statement: So willing am I to champion this cause that I will forever mark myself as a total square on the internet. I have never smoked weed, never eaten a pot brownie, never been hotboxed. I get nervous if someone whips out a dimebag. I’m outing myself as the worst person to bring to your party. Why? To show you how sincere I am about this position I’m about to take.\nPennsylvania should legalize marijuana to help subsidize the crumbling educational infrastructures of its major cities and install pre-K in Philadelphia. Doing so would render the soda tax—or any other potential tax that disproportionately affects the poor—pointless, and would democratize the burden of educational taxation.\nMarijuana. It’s such a painfully obvious answer to one of the woes of the commonwealth that it almost feels stupid to write it. This isn’t 2005, a decade away from the first states and municipalities in the United States biting the bullet and legalizing weed; it’s not some distant, European fantasy for Americans to be able to buy some herb with the full blessing of Uncle Sam. Popular sentiment is vastly in support of legalization—57 percent of Americans support legalization versus 32 percent who favor total illegalization, according to Pew.\nThe revenues that legalized marijuana taxes generate may not make the soda tax look paltry, per se, but they would come close. Mayor Kenney’s administration has said the soda tax will bring in more than $90 million annually, while the office of the Auditor General of Pennsylvania estimates a recreational weed tax could bring in $200 million across the state.\nWhat’s more: Fifty-five million adults use marijuana, more than half of whom are parents, according to a Yahoo!/Marist Poll, and 56 percent of people think smoking weed is socially acceptable. (From the same poll: 6 percent of people keep their weed in the bathroom.)\nWe are there, at least when it comes to social acceptance, and the benefits are myriad: lower arrest counts, the obliteration of an illegal trade, general chillness and, of course, the dankest of all marijuana legalization bennies—sales taxes, happily paid, by citizens all across the socioeconomic spectrum.\nThe revenues that legalized marijuana taxes generate may not make the soda tax look paltry, per se, but they would come close. Mayor Kenney’s administration has said the soda tax will bring in more than $90 million annually, while the office of the Auditor General of Pennsylvania estimates a recreational weed tax could bring in $200 million across the state. And they would eliminate the nasty elements of classism and paternalism from the mix.\nSeven states across the country have already legalized the sale of marijuana. Washington, a state with a population of 5 million people fewer than Pennsylvania, brought in $77 million in taxes from legalized weed in fiscal year 2016.\nAnd how about Denver, the unofficial weed capital of these United States? The city, in fiscal year 2016, took in about $30 million in taxes from marijuana sales. And the revenues are increasing annually, for reasons that have benefits well beyond just weed sales: People want to come to a city where they can buy a variety of bud from a well-appointed store, rather than an underground dealer. And they want to be in a place where they can witness the tangible good that the revenues from the weed they buy are doing; in Denver, that money has been spent on everything from education to law enforcement, and locals love it.\nIf we are taxing something to help fund a facet of the Philadelphia public sector that will surely be growing—like early education—wouldn’t we want to tax an item or industry that we’re not trying to discourage the growth of, like soda sales? Soda sales trend downward in cities with soda taxes. Weed tax revenues, on the other hand, trend upward annually in cities where it is legal.\nImagine making that happen in a city with a population way more than twice the size of Denver’s? One that has a massive college population and an already-remarkably laissez-faire view of marijuana? The revenue generated from marijuana sales could easily cover universal pre-K and fixes to the Philadelphia public school system. The potential revenues should have Pennsylvania politicians drooling.\nInstead, marijuana in Pennsylvania is stubbornly illegal. On Saturday night, Philly police raided activist (and former Libertarian mayoral candidate) N.A. Poe’s “Philly Smoke Sessions” party, to which hundreds of people had bought tickets for the chance to smoke, digest and purchase weed in a Frankford warehouse. Police detained 19 people on various charges, and released another 175. They also confiscated 50 pounds of pot, $50,000 in cash, four guns and about 100 pounds of edibles.\nMayor Kenney later called the raid a “little overkill,” a description Dan Gross, a founder of local cannabis culture and news site Elevated Nation, agrees with. He says it’s pretty clear that taxing weed would be far better than spending city money trying to stop its use by folks like Poe.\n“I would think that if you snapped your fingers and, poof, weed were legal in Philadelphia—sold all over the city, and taxed at a decent rate—that the volume of sales and the amount of money involved would generate way more than the soda tax,” Gross says. “For example: Before the soda tax, say a liter of coke cost $2. Okay. An ounce of weed might be $300. So that’s already the equivalent of 150 two-liter bottles of soda.”\nThe way we’ve decided to pay for our educational ambitions amounts to as much of a capitalist social experiment as it does a forthright classist injustice: The city is taxing soda, which is enjoyed regularly by 46 percent of non-white folks and 45 percent of compared to 27 percent of white people and 20 percent of high-income adults, according to Gallup. The soda tax is a large-scale economic experiment conducted at the expense of minorities and lower-income Philadelphia; a tax to get pre-Kindergarten off the ground might be a necessary evil, sure, but at this point it’s a necessary evil unnecessarily inflicted on those who can afford it least. Imagine if, instead, we taxed the one thing that people from all races and classes across Philadelphia, and Pennsylvania, from the hoagie cook to the Rittenhouse Square ad executive, consumes: dope.\nLegalizing weed could allow for our grand aspirations, free pre-K included, without the classist tax policies we have now. If only some Harrisburg prudes could chill out and just let Pennsylvanians roast a bone.\nIt doesn’t even make much sense in the long run! Similar soda-taxing plans around the country have their roots in trying to stop mostly low-income folks from drinking sugary beverages as a supposed social good. If we are taxing something to help fund a facet of the Philadelphia public sector that will surely be growing—like early education—wouldn’t we want to tax an item or industry that we’re not trying to discourage the growth of, like soda sales? (Or cigarette sales, for that matter, which are also taxed for schools.) Soda sales trend downward in cities with soda taxes. Weed tax revenues, on the other hand, trend upward annually in cities where it is legal.\nHow likely is this to happen? Total legalization of marijuana in the state is up to Harrisburg, and it’s probably a stretch to assume that a cadre of politicians who won’t raise the minimum wage to something livable will legalize a recreational drug—especially as things are likely to get dicier nationally for the weed legalization cause, under new Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has promised to revive the vastly unpopular and mostly ineffective 90’s-era war on drugs. A weed crackdown and national campaign to vilify marijuana could render any gains in the past decade completely moot.\nOn the other hand, some national advocates say Pres. Trump’s tenure may lead to a legalization whirlwind, as states race to protect their citizens from federal prosecution. And Pennsylvania is partway there already. After six long years of political wrangling, Pennsylvania last year became one of 28 states that have legalized medical cannabis. The legislation—pushed by State Senator Daylin Leach—created one of the best programs in the country, according to advocates, with some 20 different illnesses qualifying for medical marijuana. The state received about 900 applications from potential growers and dispensers by its deadline in March. The drug should be available to certain patients in early 2018.\nGov. Tom Wolf and Attorney General Josh Shapiro have both said in the past that they favor full legalization of recreational weed. And Mayor Kenney told The Inquirer yesterday that the “real solution” to Saturday’s raid in Frankford is following Colorado’s example. But the road is not likely to be easy. Even weed-friendly states like Colorado were fraught with legal challenges and procedural dawdling. It took the Centennial state more than a decade to legalize recreational marijuana after allowing for the sale of medical weed in 2000—and they were arguably the most progressive state, with regards to cannabis, for 30 years.\nThat’s too bad. Because legalizing weed could allow for our grand aspirations, free pre-K included, without the classist tax policies we have now. If only some Harrisburg prudes could chill out and just let Pennsylvanians roast a bone.\nAnd I don’t even like weed, yo.\nHeader photo by Martin Alonso via Flickr"},{"url":"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/analysis/2017/03/08/rise-in-illnesses-linked-to-foods-from-abroad-shows-need-for-fda-funding","title":"Rise in Illnesses Linked to Foods From Abroad Shows Need for FDA Funding","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"In response to consumer demand, imported foods occupy a growing share of Americans’ collective plate: About 20 percent of all food eaten in the United States is produced in other countries, up from 12 percent in the early 1990s.

Enacted in 2011 following a string of high-profile foodborne outbreaks, FSMA is meant to improve public health and reduce illnesses by requiring that companies take steps to prevent the contamination of their products.\nOne key to fulfilling FSMA’s promise is FDA’s Foreign Supplier Verification Programs rule, with enforcement for larger importers set to begin May 30. It will protect Americans’ health by requiring that imported foods meet the same safety criteria as foods grown or processed here at home. Thanks to FSMA, these standards include the nation’s first enforceable safety requirements for fruits and vegetables, a key component since produce items were the source of 84 percent of the illnesses examined by the CDC and FDA researchers.\nThe success of FDA’s prevention-based food import safety system depends largely on funding decisions that Congress will make in 2017 and 2018. Since FSMA’s enactment, Congress has worked constructively on a bipartisan basis to meet the challenge of funding the import program by expanding FDA’s capacity to modernize food safety oversight for imported foods, both in production facilities overseas and at U.S. ports and terminals. As lawmakers prepare spending bills this spring for the remainder of fiscal year 2017, they should continue making FSMA funding a priority and follow the blueprint laid out last year by Congress’ appropriations committees. Panels of the House of Representatives and the Senate recommended additional funding for FSMA’s implementation—just over $33 million and $40 million, respectively—and both directed about half of the increase to FDA’s imported food safety programs.\nAmericans deserve safe food, no matter where it comes from, and FDA plays a critical role in making that a reality. Evidence clearly shows that risks remain in the nation’s food supply. Members of Congress should continue to provide the agency with the resources needed to keep food safe and protect public health.\nSandra Eskin directs The Pew Charitable Trusts’ work on food safety."},{"url":"https://ensia.com/features/us-offshore-aquaculture","title":"Is the United States ready for offshore aquaculture?","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Ensia","description":"Although coastal aquaculture has long been seen as harmful to the environment, some are calling for a new look into operations that move the practice into…","date":"","full_text":"Food \u0026 Environment Reporting Network, a non-profit investigative news organization.\nHarlon Pearce walks muck-booted past processors gutting wild drum and red snapper to showcase a half-full new 5,000-square-foot (500-square-meter) freezer he hopes will someday house a fresh boom of marine fish. Harlon’s LA Fish sits just across the railroad tracks from the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, perfectly positioned to ship fish out of Louisiana.\nAs president of the New Orleans–based Gulf Seafood Institute, seafood supplier Pearce is a big fish himself in these parts, connected to fishermen, federal agencies, restaurateurs and even the oil industry. He knows better than anyone that wild fisheries alone can’t supply U.S. consumers’ growing demand for fish. Which is why he’s doing his best to bring everyone to the table to achieve one goal: farming the Gulf of Mexico.\nThere are currently no commercial finfish operations in U.S. federal waters, located between 3 and 200 miles (5 to 322 kilometers) offshore. Pearce and others are convinced that jumping into the rapidly growing open ocean aquaculture industry expanding into offshore waters globally is the future of sustainable seafood.\nIn 2015, per capita fish consumption in the United States was 15.5 pounds (7 kilograms), up from 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) in 1980. Globally, however, the amount of all wild-caught fish has stayed relatively stagnant — at around 80–90 million metric tons (90–100 million tons) — for the past two decades.\nGlobally, in total, around 160 million metric tons (180 million tons) of fish — wild, farmed, marine and freshwater — are produced to satisfy annual demand.\nThe Gulf of Mexico annually yields a catch of about 29,000 metric tons (32,000 tons) of wild-caught finfish, which are bony fish such as snapper or grouper. Given regional demand, Pearce says, “our wild marine fish don’t go too far.” To his point, in New Orleans’ French Quarter there is a seafood restaurant on practically every block.\nThe World Bank predicts that by 2030, two-thirds of fish being consumed will be farmed. Which is why Pearce and others believe the U.S. should be farming fish in its open waters.\nProducing more of our seafood in the U.S. means that consumers will have local, safe, sustainable choices, explained Michael Rubino, director of the Washington, D.C.–based Office of Aquaculture at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Fisheries, when he announced a federally approved plan taking shape in the Gulf of Mexico. The gulf, by volume, is second only to Alaska in terms of U.S. wild-catch fisheries. In January 2016, NOAA authorized up to 20 open-ocean aquaculture permits for the gulf. In total, these could produce 29,000 metric tons (32,000 tons) of fish — effectively doubling the amount of finfish currently coming out of the area. (A draft environmental impact statement that would help guide offshore aquaculture development in Hawaii is expected later this year, and public hearings this summer will decide the fate of a proposed finfish farm to be located 8 miles off the coast of Hampton Bays, New York).\nMarine aquaculture, so far largely based in coastal waters, has long been anathema to environmentalists, its reputation blighted by everything from pollution and disease outbreaks to the destruction of mangroves and genetic contamination from escaped fish. Open-ocean aquaculture could reduce some of these environmental concerns, assuming it is sited in deep, swift waters, reducing the potential for pollution and disease without destroying habitat, and remaining challenges, such as fish escaping and forage fish being used as feed in huge quantities, have promising fixes.\nAs a result, some environmentalists are saying open-ocean aquaculture deserves a fresh look. Since all food we grow, on land or in the sea, has some environmental impact, isn’t aquaculture worth exploring if it can satisfy rising demand for healthier protein with less impact than, say, beef or pigs?\nCan It Really Be Sustainable?\nGiven the idealized small, local, low-input view of sustainable farming, offshore aquaculture presents something of a paradox. On one hand, U.S. fish farms would be local and more heavily regulated than some farms producing imports. On the other, to be economically viable, operations would need to be industrial-scale. “There will be costs to the wallet and environment. It’s unavoidable. But if done correctly, environmental costs will be negligible,” says Greg Lutz, an aquaculture specialist with the Louisiana State University Aquaculture Research Station, based in Baton Rouge. “As a society, we have to decide what impacts are acceptable. There’s no free lunch.”\nOpen Blue, the largest open ocean fish farm in the world, located 8 miles off the coast of Panama, is a good place to look when addressing the idea of scale and sustainability. Owner Brian O’Hanlon and his investors chose to stock cobia for three primary reasons: it would avoid direct competition with wild fishing, it would offer versatility to chefs and it would appeal to health-conscious consumers.\nTenney Flynn, co-owner and award-winning chef at GW Fins in New Orleans, prefers his cobia spearfished, but sees aquaculture as inevitable in the U.S. “There’s too many people in the world and fish is too popular,” he says. If he does buy farmed cobia, he prefers the quality out of Central America compared with Vietnam. A local option would offer an incentive, however. “The expense with aquaculture is the freight. If you can take freight out of the equation, it knocks off US$2 per pound,” he says. Local fish are already Flynn’s preference: His menu in February listed 12 finfish, of which roughly 70 percent were local and wild.\nThere are signs that operations like Open Blue can be sustainable. O’Hanlon gave then University of Miami Ph.D. student Aaron Welch, who was studying the environmental impacts of aquaculture, the run of the farm during 2012–13 to collect environmental data as long as he shared it with O’Hanlon. One concern with offshore farms is that concentrated waste from these operations, either in the water or underlying sediment, could adversely impact ecosystems — at worst, resulting in eutrophication or fish mortality. According to Welch, the open-ocean cage operation left no nutrient footprint in the water column, either from dissolved oxygen or nitrogen compounds. He did find a modest uptick of organic carbon and nitrogen compounds in the sediment around the cages.\nExtrapolating published data to calculate a maximum amount of fish poop [4,000 metric tons (4,400 tons) of nitrogen compounds for each 29,000 metric tons (32,000 tons) of fish produced] from the federally approved Gulf Coast operations would effectively be a drop in the bucket (and, Lutz says, a “worst-case scenario” given the methods used in the paper) compared with what already gets dumped into the gulf from Midwest farm chemicals via the Mississippi River. In May 2016, the gulf’s estimated input of nitrites and nitrates was 150,000 metric tons (165,000 tons).\nAnother potential sustainability issue, antibiotic use — overuse can lead to bacteria resistant to antibiotics — has declined. Vaccines have largely supplanted antibiotic use, at least in Europe and the Americas, and antibiotics are more heavily regulated in aquaculture than in any other kind of animal production, says Neil Sims, co-founder of Kampachi Farms, a research facility in Kona, Hawaii, who is planning a commercial offshore operation, located 4 miles (6 kilometers) offshore from Bahia de La Paz, Mexico, to grow a sashimi-grade Almaco jack. He and colleagues have also experimented with untethered open ocean drifter pens and unmanned net-pen operations off the Hawaii coast. He laments the slow pace of the U.S. government actions to streamline the regulatory landscape.\n“The logic of not doing [open-ocean aquaculture in the U.S.] escapes me,” says Albert “Rusty” Gaudé, a fishery extension agent based in Jefferson, Louisiana, with the Louisiana Sea Grant program, one of 33 NOAA-funded state college research programs focused on long-term economic development and environmental stewardship. “I can’t think of any large-scale animal-production scheme that has been looked at as much as this has been. Cattle feedlots certainly weren’t.”\nExisting data indicate that marine fish farms are far more efficient and pollute less than cattle or pig farms. Based on Conservation International’s 2011 “Blue Frontiers” report, says Jack Kittinger, senior director of Conservation International’s global fisheries and aquaculture program, based in Honolulu, Hawaii, “offshore aquaculture looks a lot more sustainable than other animal production methods, which was eye-opening for us.”\nAccording to the Conservation International report, fish turn feed into flesh four and 13 times more efficiently than pigs or cows, respectively.\nAnd they generate less nitrogen and phosphorus pollution — for example, half to two-thirds less nitrogen (per metric ton of protein produced) than pigs or cows, respectively. Fish-generated phosphorus is roughly 15 percent less than pigs and 55 percent less than cows (per metric ton of protein produced).\nOne strong argument in favor of ramping up open-ocean aquaculture in the U.S. is that the country imports 90 percent of its seafood, and half of that is farm-raised overseas in operations that can have dubious internal levels of food-safety and environmental oversight.\nIf we put all the options on the same table and compare everything in terms of nutritional value and environmental impacts, open ocean aquaculture looks very promising, says Ben Halpern, director of the University of California, Santa Barbara–based National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis.\nMarine ecologist Steve Gaines, dean of the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UCSB, was stunned by what he and colleagues found while comparing available data on the greenhouse-gas footprint of different animal production methods. Finfish and shellfish aquaculture had a much lower GHG footprint than anything land-based (and shellfish aquaculture could even reduce nutrient pollution, something that could be useful in the Gulf of Mexico). “Producing all of our future animal protein needs via beef adds [the equivalent of emissions from] another United States, whereas if we produced the same amount of shellfish protein, we would only add another Texas,” he says. The main reason is that shellfish, filter feeders, do not require a food supply; they thrive on the copious nutrients already in the water. Aquaculture — specifically operations that use best practices, Gaines clarifies — offers great opportunities to meet future food demands.\nOne strong argument in favor of ramping up open-ocean aquaculture in the U.S. is that the country imports 90 percent of its seafood, and half of that is farm-raised overseas in operations that can have dubious internal levels of food-safety and environmental oversight. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the top seven countries that export aquaculture-raised seafood to the U.S. are Canada, Chile, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Vietnam and China, which led global aquaculture production with 69 million metric tons (76 million tons) produced in 2016. Since the FDA can’t physically screen all seafood imports, it monitors whether foreign suppliers comply with U.S. food-safety laws and uses a program called PREDICT to identify higher-risk shipments for physical examination.\nIntensive operations in Asia, the region with the fastest growth in aquaculture and the most lax environmental oversight, are ripe for the spread of disease. In 2010, a devastating disease, hepatopancreatic necrosis syndrome, rippled through shrimp farms throughout China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand. The FDA has issued two countrywide alerts requiring mandatory testing for antimicrobials for aquaculture-raised seafood before entry into the U.S. — one in 2007 for seafood from China, and another in shrimp from the Malaysian peninsula in April 2016.\nIncreasingly, global operations are moving into open ocean waters — except in the U.S., where stiff regulatory hurdles have so far made it difficult for investors in, for example, southern California to get approval for operations.\nNOAA’s gulf ruling was not without controversy. The day it went into effect, 11 groups — from associations of commercial and recreational fishers to local and national environmental organizations — filed a joint lawsuit challenging NOAA’s authority to permit industrial aquaculture offshore. The lawsuit alleges that NOAA’s authority under the 2007 Magnuson-Stevens Act, the primary law governing marine fisheries management in federal waters, is to regulate wild fisheries catches only, not industrial aquaculture operations. In essence, the plaintiffs’ legal argument is that this is farming, not fishing.\n“Fishermen are concerned about keeping the gulf safe and productive in light of the scale of aquaculture being proposed,” says Will Ward, the attorney representing fisheries plaintiffs in the lawsuit and a former fisherman. “They are the ambassadors for wild fish stocks.”\n“If something goes wrong, the citizens of the Gulf Coast are the ones left holding the bag.” – Will Ward\nOne concern is the threat of escaped fish, but improved netting reduces the likelihood this will happen. In the gulf, only native fish can be farmed under NOAA’s new permitting rules. Yet several studies have shown that hatchery rearing, even a single generation, can alter fish genetics — specifically, survival and reproductive success. While a few escapees would likely live long enough to mate and spread their genes, most would likely end up as prey, says Patrick Banks, assistant secretary of the Office of Fisheries at the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.\nStill, says Ward, “[commercial and recreational fishing] is a multibillion-dollar industry we’re talking about. If something goes wrong, the citizens of the Gulf Coast are the ones left holding the bag.”\nSo far, no one has submitted an application for an aquaculture permit in the Gulf. The reason, according to industry insiders, is that investors are loath to invite the ire of environmentalists or fishermen without a smooth regulatory pathway — and that includes resolution of the pending lawsuit.\nLocation, Location, Location\nBut all of this may be putting the cart before the horse. The most pressing question may be whether the Gulf of Mexico is even the best place for U.S. offshore farming.\nThere is one often-cited advantage to the oil-rich gulf over other potential regions in the U.S.: infrastructure. “The Gulf of Mexico is a natural place for aquaculture to start [in the U.S.],” says Gulf Seafood Institute’s Pearce. “Everything is here shoreside. We’ve got vessels, processing facilities, and we shouldn’t waste these oil platforms.” He’s referring to the 2,110 oil platforms currently spread throughout gulf waters; over 600 are waiting to be decommissioned. Oil platforms could serve as aquatic barns, storing fish feed and pen equipment, which would reduce start-up costs.\nBut the gulf also presents formidable challenges. The region is still recovering from the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The oil rigs share the waters with heavy marine traffic. A large portion of the gulf suffers from an annual hypoxic or “dead” zone resulting from the agrochemicals draining into it from the Mississippi River. And the region is vulnerable to increasingly severe hurricanes, although submersible pens exist that can be lowered to avoid a storm’s destructive wave energy.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, fishermen, who have faced strict catch limits imposed to rebuild wild stocks in recent years, are among the most concerned about the potential negative impacts of allowing industrial aquaculture in these sensitive waters.\nThat concern was on display at the recent Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council meeting in New Orleans in late January. Schools of commercial and recreational fishermen congregated outside the AstorCrowne Plaza hotel meeting room as the 17-member oversight body reviewed stock assessments, catch limits and catch-report requirements.\nBuddy Guindon is executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Shareholders Alliance, a non-profit that represents commercial fishermen interests. He fishes the waters near Galveston, Texas, where the organization is based. These waters are shallow and so won’t likely be directly affected by offshore aquaculture operations, which is ideally located in deep, swift-moving water. Still, he explains that the gulf is essentially a semi-closed body of water dominated by a northward-flowing loop current of warm water from the Caribbean. “We’re concerned about the [fish farm] effluent, the waste,” he says.\nRegional fishermen aren’t just concerned about what goes into the water, though. What comes out is raising questions, too. Currently, 20 million tons (18 million metric tons) of wild fish — one-quarter of the world’s commercial catch — is turned into fishmeal. Greater regional demand for fishmeal production, they worry, could leave fewer forage fish for the wild species, given that a sizable chunk of gulf menhaden — a small, oily forage fish — is already turned into fishmeal for aquaculture elsewhere. In May 2015, Empire, Louisiana-based Daybrook Fisheries, the second biggest U.S. processor of menhaden, was sold for US$380 million to Oceana, a South African fishing business that supplies fishmeal around the world.\nBut new sources of fishmeal — from soy to insect larvae to seaweed — promise to alleviate the demand for forage fish. “The frontier [on aquaculture feeds] is lowering the environmental footprint entirely,” says Conservation International’s Kittinger. He says this will include converting vegetable matter and even food waste streams into feed.\nStill, the debate over aquaculture simmered in the hallways outside the fishery council meeting in January, where fishermen’s organizations discussed whether they should remain part of the lawsuit against NOAA’s new permitting proposal. In the end, Guindon says, the Shareholders Alliance and the Charter Fishermen’s Association grew leery of appearing anti-aquaculture, and opted to leave the lawsuit in February. Guindon says fishermen would favor a “slow ramping up of aquaculture if there were heavy requirements for third-party monitoring of any harm that might be occurring and the regulatory authority to cease actions.”\nBut trust in that regulatory authority is a big issue in the Gulf of Mexico. Just blocks away from the meeting, Cynthia Sarthou sighs and shakes her head. It may be cynical, says the executive director of the Gulf Restoration Network, an oil-industry watchdog in the region and a remaining participant in the lawsuit, but she has little confidence that federal agencies, especially promoters of an industry, will fully enforce regulations. NOAA, for example, is housed in the U.S. Department of Commerce. “I have never seen a situation where regulatory agencies in the gulf are fully able to implement regulations and safeguard the environment, especially when economic interests are involved.” She blames a lack of funding and political pressure. “Agencies are subject to political pressure, politicians answer to people who invest in campaigns, and industry invests in campaigns,” she says. And while NOAA may mean well, she says, it is one of the weakest regulatory bodies in the region. She points to countries like Norway as admirable regulators of industry. “If we had the environmental ethic of Norway, I would be much more comfortable with this,” she adds.\nIt’s unclear how offshore aquaculture will be perceived by the Trump administration. Wilbur Ross, the new head of the U.S. Department of Commerce, said in his January 2017 Congressional confirmation hearing that he would like to see the U.S. become a net exporter of fish. Yet the administration’s newly proposed budget includes drastic cuts to federal agencies, including NOAA and the Coast Guard. It’s too early to tell what that will mean for regulatory oversight.\nSupporters of offshore aquaculture argue that current U.S. regulations are unnecessarily cumbersome. A new memorandum of understanding details the seven government agencies that will be involved in permitting offshore aquaculture in the Gulf of Mexico. NOAA Fisheries Southeast Regional Office, the lead agency, will issue permits to deploy operations offshore and sell the harvest. A pollution discharge permit will need to be secured from the Environmental Protection Agency, while the Army Corps of Engineers will regulate the placement of structures or modification of navigable waterways. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Bureau of Safety and Environment Enforcement, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Coast Guard will also review operations.\nThe Economics of Aquaculture\nAdvocates like Gulf Seafood Institute’s Pearce believe aquaculture will bring economic benefits to coastal communities, at least between southern Louisiana and the Florida panhandle, which are closest to the deep, rapid-moving waters where offshore fish farms would need to be placed. These communities have been hard hit in recent years from human-caused and natural disasters. For example, Hurricane Isaac struck Venice, Louisiana, in 2012, two years after the fishing community was devastated by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that occurred only 50 miles to the southeast.\nThe commercial fishing industry lost millions of dollars in sales and thousands of jobs in the first eight months after the oil spill, according to one study. But many in these coastal communities don’t expect aquaculture to bring them anything but headaches. With this much risk and money at stake, aquaculture investors have little incentive to employ local fishermen, processors or dock handlers, predicts Margaret Curole, Gulf Coast native and a founding member of the Commercial Fishermen of America, an advocacy group. Rather, aquaculture fish could be transported up the Mississippi River directly to New Orleans suppliers, bypassing fishing communities all together.\nCatch shares, allotted fish quotas allowed given total catch limits, which can be sold among fishermen, already proved unprofitable for a number of the smaller fishing operations, forcing them out of business. And Venice-based shrimpers, who struggle to compete with massive farmed imports from overseas, offer an example of how farmed seafood affects global markets. Now fin fishermen are nervous about competition, too.\nPearce hears such economic concerns often, but is convinced the opposite is more likely. “Aquaculture creates markets,” he insists. He says farmed Atlantic salmon is the perfect example. It makes seafood affordable for the masses, while wild-caught salmon garners a premium price for people willing to pay.\nIn the gulf, offshore aquaculture operations would likely focus on high-value species that don’t make up much of current catches. There are only a few high-value native species that would make economic sense — fewer still that have developed successful hatchery production, such as cobia, pompano and red drum, says Rex Caffey, a natural resource economist based in Baton Rouge with the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center and Louisiana Sea Grant.\nCobia is an aquaculture favorite because of its remarkable growth rate, but that might bring problems of its own. “A tsunami of cobia is coming at us” from around the world, which could flood the market and cause prices to plummet, says Louisiana Sea Grant’s Gaudé.\nThe biggest unknown, says Caffey, is whether offshore fish farms could survive economically in the gulf given the daunting infrastructure costs, labor, transport, liability concerns and environmental constraints.\nInvestors may eye existing oil platforms, but their use is not without significant costs. Matt McCarroll, president and CEO of Fieldwood Energy, LLC, in Houston, says his company is the largest owner of offshore platforms in the U.S. and has been actively decommissioning them in recent years. He says he’s been contacted five or six times in the past 10 years by potential aquaculture investors interested in using the platforms. But the conversations end, he says, as soon as he explains that it will cost US$2 million to US$10 million, depending on size and water depth, to take over maintenance, liability and responsibility for decommissioning the platforms.\nPerhaps the biggest limitation in the gulf is that, under the NOAA provisions, no single operation would be allowed to produce more than 5,800 metric tons [6,400 tons, or 20 percent of the gulf maximum limit of 29,000 metric tons (32,000 tons)]. “That’s laughable — the size of a modest Norwegian fish farm,” says Kampachi Farms’ Sims. “Especially when you look at the moral imperative to grow more of our own seafood.”\nThe economics of aquaculture have always been risky — with significant up-front cost and a lengthy time to recoup investment. Louisiana State University’s Lutz tells an old joke among fish farmers: “If you want to make a small fortune in aquaculture, start with a large fortune.”\n“These operations only get efficient with scale; they require a large investment and a viable permit pathway in U.S. waters. That’s why people aren’t running” to apply for permits in the gulf, says Sims. And, he adds, that’s why operations that could have been in the U.S. end up in places like Panama, where Open Blue is located, and others such as Mexico and Costa Rica, where open-ocean aquaculture is already up and running.\nTesting the Waters\nOffshore aquaculture offers a glimpse of the kind of difficult food-security decisions societies will grapple with going forward — knowingly facing and mitigating the unavoidable consequences of producing the food we eat. “As populations continue to grow, we won’t be fighting over oil and gas, but over freshwater and food,” says Robert Orr, managing director of Cuna del Mar, a private equity fund that invests in sustainable aquaculture companies, including Open Blue.\nConservation International soft-launched a program in January 2017 called Blue Production with the aim of shaping and spreading best practices throughout the aquaculture industry. “Aquaculture is only going to grow, so how can we steer it in the right direction?” asks Conservation International’s Kittinger.\nAny kind of farming can be done sustainably — or not. Offshore aquaculture could contribute to a future where food demand is met in a way that does not contribute to environmental degradation so often associated with farming. In the U.S., it remains to be seen whether strict regulations and a robust, sustainable form of fish production can go hand in hand. But supporters say it’s time to test the waters."},{"url":"http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/After-the-branch-fell-Paralyzed-SF-mother-11189715.php","title":"A life divided: Mother paralyzed by falling tree branch in SF struggles after accident","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"San Francisco Chronicle","description":"Mother paralyzed by falling tree branch in SF struggles after accident  The last thing she remembers is her daughters leaning down to feed the birds.

It was a late afternoon in mid-August last year, the kind of Friday that lulls people into sunbathing on the grass. Zhou sat on a bench beneath the shade of a huge Canary Island pine watching the girls throw stale bread to the pigeons. The soft swish of the leaves overhead and the cadence of her children’s laughter was intoxicating.\nIt would be her last normal moment, the divide between then and now.\nZhou has no memory of the 100-pound pine limb snapping off its trunk, or of it crushing the bench she was sitting on. When officers arrived just after 3:10 p.m., they found her lying on the sidewalk screaming for help, her head in a halo of blood. Her 5- and 9-year-old daughters stood frozen. By the time medics took her vital signs and strapped her onto a gurney, she was unresponsive.\nShe awoke in a hospital room to a cacophony of chirping medical equipment. A piercing pain radiated up her spine and into her skull. Nurses in cranberry-colored scrubs adjusted the plastic cone around her neck. Her husband, mother-in-law and daughters, the oldest bandaged where the branch had scraped her back, peeked around the door frame. Opioids clouded Zhou’s understanding of the scene.\nMore than 10 months after the pine limb crushed her skull and severed her spinal cord, Zhou remains at Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in San Francisco.\nShe and her husband, Tony Tan, 46, have sued the city, claiming its care of the tree was negligent. As bills stack up and court proceedings grind forward, Zhou is trapped in a medical purgatory as her daughters begin to grow up without her.\nShe is paralyzed from the waist down and will never walk again, doctors say. It could have been anyone sitting under the tree in the park that day. But it is her life that has been permanently interrupted.\n“I felt happy and satisfied easily,” she said of life before the accident, “and I felt grateful for everything. Now …,” her voice trails off.\nThis was not the life she and Tan envisioned when they emigrated from China. He came first, moving with his parents from Taishan in the southern Guangdong province to San Francisco in 1984 when he was 13. In 2002, a mutual friend introduced them. Zhou was living in Kaiping, a small city on the Pearl River Delta 45 minutes north of Tan’s hometown. They fell in love over trans-Pacific phone calls and married there in 2003. She moved to Northern California a year later.\nThe couple bought a two-bedroom home in San Pablo with a big backyard to grow Swiss chard, chives, bok choy, tomatoes and kale. They brought two cherubic-faced baby girls in pink knit hats home to that house. Tan got a job repairing electronics at Central Computers on Howard Street. Zhou took English language classes at City College and shuttled the girls to school. She cooked sticky rice and elaborate cakes decorated with strawberries sliced to look like blooming flowers.\nBefore she was a paraplegic, Zhou ran laps around their neighborhood every morning. She wanted to register for a race, maybe even a marathon, and feel the weight of a medal around her neck. She volunteered in her older daughter’s classroom. Someday, she hoped to work at a hair salon and would practice on her family, trimming her daughters’ bangs and shaving Tan’s sideburns.\nEvery Sunday, they went to Myoshinji Temple in Pinole. At first, Tan would nap in the car in the Buddhist shrine’s parking lot while Zhou attended services. But he was fascinated by the parishioners’ tranquillity, so he joined. It opened his heart, he said, and brought him newfound peace.\nIt was a simple life, an easy life, Tan said.\nAnd then the tree branch fell.\nIn the days after the Aug. 12 accident, no one knew whom to blame. City officials trucked the branch to an outside arborist for an examination, searching for clues as to why it had snapped. Then they locked away the limb — now evidence — at an undisclosed location.\nIn November, Zhou and Tan filed a lawsuit against the city in San Francisco Superior Court seeking damages greater than $25,000 for negligence. Her hospital expenses are partly covered by health insurance, but it won’t be enough to cover a lifetime of medical dependency — those costs are not yet calculable. Until Friday, their GoFundMe campaign was more than $7,000 short of its $50,000 goal.\nTheir suit says the Canary Island pine had been “negligently pruned” in a way that “causes the rapid growth of large, heavy and weakly attached branches,” which can kill people. Her attorneys say that the city had received reports of falling tree branches in that same part of the park.\n“The city knows that trees pruned like this must be watched closely and pruned frequently because they will continue to develop branches that are too heavy and large for the tree to support,” said attorney Jeremy Cloyd, who is representing Zhou and her family.\nThe tree whose branch struck Zhou had been trimmed through a tree topping method, the lawsuit says. The upper part of the 50-foot-tall tree was removed, allowing its lateral branches to grow rapidly.\nTree assessment records show that the city was slow to routinely inspect and maintain the pine trees near the Washington Square playground to industry standards, which call for pruning every 15 years.\nThe Recreation and Park Department says budget shortfalls have long impacted tree maintenance. Each of the 177,000 trees on the department’s land was scheduled to be serviced only once every 105 years as of 2010. But department officials say that $8 million in bond funding over the past seven years and $750,000 from the General Fund annually has helped speed tree maintenance.\nTree experts say Canary Island pines are typically stable compared with other trees. In a database run by the International Society of Arboriculture, only 24 of 6,026 tree failures since 1987 in California involved that species. Eight of the 24 Canary Island pine failures — when a trunk, branch or root breaks — in California involved broken limbs like the branch that hit Zhou.\nBut city arborists who examined the tree multiple times after the limb split off and hit Zhou maintain it is structurally sound. The tree was not trimmed using a tree-topping method, city officials say, and the branch falling was a fluke.\n“We’re still gathering and assessing all of the information we can, but at the moment there is no indication that this was anything but an unforeseeable, freak accident,” said John Coté, a spokesman for City Attorney Dennis Herrera. “This is a heartbreaking situation. At the same time, the city has a legal responsibility to all taxpayers that we must honor. We are doing everything we can to work in good faith with the plaintiffs.”\nAbout 25 to 35 people are killed by falling trees or branches annually in the United States, said Tom Schmidlin, a professor in the Department of Geography at Kent State University, who studies and tracks tree-related storm deaths.\nIn 2008, a redwood limb in Stern Grove snapped, striking and killing a San Francisco woman as she loaded her dog into the back of a Subaru Outback. In January, a tree crushed a Ukiah home, killing a woman as she slept.\nBut Zhou lived.\n“Before, I would never pay attention,” Zhou said in Cantonese through an interpreter. “Now every time I go under a tree, I think, is it going to fall?”\n“Ten more minutes, Emma,” said Richard Sigua, a physical therapy aide at the rehabilitation center in the shadow of Twin Peaks.\nZhou’s eyes are fixed on a blinking plastic kitchen timer counting down the seconds. Her legs are strapped in a metal brace, and she stands tall and unassisted. Late February sun streams through the windows, alighting on the new strands of white in her hair. Across the gym, patients in wheelchairs circled an instructor teaching Zumba. They waved their hands to the beat of “The Macarena.”\nDoctors are trying to slow the steady atrophy of the muscles Zhou once used to run, play basketball and to crouch to hug her daughters. They have her lift weights on a rickshaw — she started at 40 pounds and can now pull 60. She flexes her growing biceps after each set, proud of the newfound strength. Three times a week, she stands in a metal brace.\nZhou’s once-strong and lithe body has become the enemy: her quadriceps jumping with spasms, nerves misfiring, muscles atrophying and toes pointing in a perpetual ballerina’s tendu. Contractions ripple up to her stomach, the pain white-hot.\nAfter the exercises, Zhou goes to the art room. She paints bluejays with moist pink worms dangling from their beaks and Mount Tamalpais shrouded in a layer of coastal fog. This is Zhou’s life now: a parade of doctor’s appointments, rehabilitation sessions and crafts, most contained within the hospital’s walls.\nShe knits teal scarves, paints and watches Korean soap operas on TV, the tedium the only thing she can count on. She looks out the window at the undulating grass. Robins chatter through the thick glass, and pigeons peck at the cement. She prays, reciting the same intention over and over: Let me walk. Let me walk again. Let me live outside of this wheelchair. Let me be the mother and wife I once was.\nBut there is no timeline for being discharged. And she can’t go home because her San Pablo house isn’t equipped for a woman in a wheelchair.\n“I think about if my husband will despise me, or if he will leave me someday,” she said. “Before the accident happened, I was more confident. I felt happier and lived with my family without any worries. I felt blessed at that time. Before the accident, I was a more cheerful person.”\nHer husband and daughters have moved in with his parents in the four-bedroom Visitacion Valley condominium where he grew up. Tan was once shot on the sidewalk out front during an attempted robbery. The bullet is still lodged in his left arm. He had moved to a safer neighborhood in the East Bay for his family. But after his wife was injured, he moved home so his parents could help with his daughters and to be closer to the hospital.\n“Life takes you places,” Tan said. “Sometimes you can’t avoid it. It takes you back, even though you want to move on to a better place.”\nHe brings Chinese broccoli and catfish stew to Zhou, bottles of acrylic paint from Michael’s art supply and primary-colored helium balloons from their nephew’s first birthday party.\nAt night, Tan’s mind flashes back to the first X-ray and the sliver of black where there shouldn’t be: his wife’s spinal cord separated. When sleep won’t come, he reaches for his cell phone, searching for solutions: spinal surgeries in China, acupuncture techniques, stem cell research.\nTan buys a tan van with a handicap lift off Craigslist for $7,000 and a used wheelchair on eBay for $2,500. He learns to cook simple recipes in his mother’s kitchen — hard-boiled eggs and oatmeal — and shop for tiny jumpers and jackets for his daughters at discount department stores.\nHe has taken a leave of absence from work to be both parents for the girls. At night, they often wake up screaming or sleepwalk around the condo. For weeks after the accident, his younger daughter stopped talking.\nSometimes, he sits in Zhou’s room watching midday TV and flipping through the business cards he keeps in his pocket: city officials, doctors, social workers, marriage counselor, contractors, child therapists and physical therapists. They are the people who will try to equip his parents’ home — the couple’s San Pablo house has too many barriers — with wide hallways and long ramps for Zhou’s wheelchair, fix the trauma of what their daughters saw, fix their marriage. But they can’t fix everything.\n“We’ll all be together,” Tan said, his voice cracking. “But it will never be normal again for her. I don’t understand why. If the tree was healthy, why did it drop down so fast? To me, it’s bad luck. Really, really bad luck.”\nOn an afternoon in early April, her daughters visit Zhou at Laguna Honda.\nThey walk alongside their mother’s wheelchair to the small farm on the hospital’s campus in search of the gray tabby that likes to sit in Zhou’s lap. The girls inspect the strawberry blossoms and the blooming Icelandic poppies. They fling water from a bucket into the sky, screaming. Their visits are few, twice a week, sometimes more during school breaks.\nThey stand taller than Zhou’s wheelchair now, more unfamiliar to her with each passing week. Their hair has grown longer; their fingernails are painted by someone else. Her older girl has started reading the Harry Potter series, the youngest has learned to brush her own teeth. Zhou thinks about them leaving her, the day they will no longer need their mother. She wonders if they even need her now.\nIt must be karma, Zhou decides, the lingering consequences from sinning in a past life. The tree branch, and everything that has come after, was never meant for anyone else. The vials of prescription pills, the dependency on strangers to change her diapers, a lifetime condemned to a wheelchair — all for her.\nShe has stopped asking why.\n“The world is still a beautiful place,” her husband tells her. “You have your daughters. You could have been like the woman in Ukiah. She didn’t even have a chance. You’re lucky.”\n“Maybe she was the lucky one,” Zhou replies.\nHer sadness ebbs and grows. She cries for hours, not certain just why. In the first few months, she considered suicide, but not anymore. Now, she often doesn’t feel anything, she said.\nMonths after the accident, Zhou sketches in bed. Plastic packages of baby wipes, deodorizer and sharp-tipped colored pencils litter the bedside table. Trinkets from the friends she rarely sees and drawings of the shaded places she can no longer walk cover the walls.\nHer calves, swollen in their compression socks, peek from under a blanket. She runs her fingers through her hair, hiding the thick white scar arcing along the curve of her skull. Ten months and still no end in sight.\nIn her drawing, Zhou sits facing a tree. The dark of her silhouette, face hidden, fades to the white of a sky brightened by sunshine. A ghost floats above the grass. Devils peer from the bushes.\n“I’m trying to draw my own story and my own fear,” she said.\nIn her picture, the tree branch never falls.\nLizzie Johnson is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

","date":"","full_text":"For four nights, 2-year-old Bella Bond refused to go to sleep. Her mother, Rachelle Bond, said the restless child would run in and out of her bedroom, frustrating Rachelle Bond’s live-in boyfriend, Michael McCarthy.\nOne late night in June 2015, as the couple listened to the little girl play in her room, McCarthy got out of bed and said he would go talk to her.\nFive minutes later, Rachelle Bond went to check on them, she testified Friday in Suffolk Superior Court. Through a crack in the door, she watched in horror as McCarthy punched the child so hard in the stomach the girl bounced up and down in her bed, Bond said. Bella was unconscious, her face swollen and gray.\n“What the [expletive] did you do?” Bond said she screamed at him.\n“ ‘It was her time to die,’ ” McCarthy replied, according to Bond. “ ‘She was a demon.’ ”\nBond’s wrenching account marked the first time she had spoken publicly about Bella’s death. Bond, 41, is the prosecution’s most critical witness in the trial against McCarthy, 37, who is accused of first-degree murder in Bella’s death. Her testimony is the strongest evidence that Bella was killed.\nThe child’s body was found washed ashore on Deer Island. The condition of her body made it impossible for the state medical examiner’s office to determine an exact cause of death, and investigators found no physical evidence of a slaying in the couple’s Dorchester apartment.\nBond, a recovering drug addict with a long list of criminal convictions, is testifying against McCarthy under a plea agreement, and is expected to receive two years of probation for her alleged role in the disposal of her daughter’s body. In February, she pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact in the slaying. She is being held at Suffolk County House of Correction until her sentencing date.\nProsecutors said McCarthy put Bella’s body in a duffel bag, weighed it down, and dumped it in Boston Harbor. But McCarthy’s lawyer, Jonathan Shapiro, asserted in his opening statement that Rachelle Bond killed her daughter, not McCarthy.\nOn Friday, Bond told a rapt courtroom how she ran to her daughter’s lifeless body and began performing CPR. The girl did not respond.\nBond said she picked the child up to take her out of the room, but McCarthy grabbed her and put his hands around her throat. Bella fell to the floor.\n“He said he would kill me,” Bond testified. She blacked out and woke up on the couch, feeling sick and dizzy.\n“Did you think about running out of the apartment, running as fast as you could?” David Deakin, a Suffolk assistant district attorney, asked Bond.\n“He was in the apartment. I was scared,” Bond said. “I felt pretty trapped.”\nGrieving, frightened, and in drug withdrawal, Bond said she let McCarthy inject heroin into her neck.\nShe said she spent several days in a daze, drifting in and out of consciousness, until she woke up late one night. McCarthy threw a pair of shoes at her, she said, and told her to come with him.\nThey walked to the car and Bond said she looked in the back seat. She saw her green duffel bag. Her daughter’s thigh was visible, Bond testified.\nShe screamed and McCarthy hit her in the head, she said. She passed out again, and when she came to was somewhere in South Boston. McCarthy left the car with the bag and returned empty-handed a few minutes later.\nThey returned to their Dorchester apartment and lay on the bed in silence.\nBond is expected to return to the stand Monday and is likely to undergo a grueling cross-examination by Shapiro, who in his opening statement said Bond became obsessed with the occult and became convinced her daughter was possessed by demons trying to get her.\nBond was calm throughout her testimony Friday. Dressed in a black pantsuit, her long dark hair down, Bond seldom looked at McCarthy, who scribbled furiously in his notepad and conferred often with Shapiro.\nDeakin asked Bond to talk about the troubling moments of her life: She began using drugs at an early age and became addicted to heroin at 33. She was arrested several times for offenses such as heroin and cocaine possession, larceny, and prostitution.\nHer dependence on heroin deepened after she lost custody of two children she had when she was younger. In 2000, she gave birth to premature twins who did not survive.\nRachelle Bond said she was “ecstatic” when Bella was born in August 2012.\n“She was awesome,” Bond said.\nShe described a close relationship with her daughter. They played together in the park, Bella feasted on her mother’s homemade pizza and lobster bisque. Bond diligently took the child to her doctor’s appointments at Boston Medical Center.\nIn 2014, Bond met McCarthy outside a CVS in the South End. A year later, he moved in with her. Soon, the couple was using heroin together, even with Bella in the apartment.\nMcCarthy never worked and spent most of his time texting his friends and looking up astrology websites, Bond said. He occasionally played with Bella, lifting her up when she asked and chatting with her. But he told Bond that she indulged the child too much.\n“He would complain that I didn’t discipline her,” Bond said.\nBut until that night in June, Bond said, she never feared McCarthy would hurt her daughter.\nMcCarthy’s older brother, Joseph, testified before Bond. He described Bella as a happy child who was never mistreated by Bond or his brother.\nHis voice became hoarse and he wiped his eyes as he recalled one joyful day in Bella’s short life. On Easter Sunday of 2015, two months before her body was found, the couple and Bella joined him, McCarthy’s father, and his fiancée for dinner at Phillips Old Colony House in Dorchester. A man dressed as the Easter Bunny was at the restaurant, and McCarthy’s father asked if he would say hello to the child.

Terry Canales in a fiery floor speech late Thursday. “Government is the servant of the people, not the other way around.”\nCanales, a South Texas Democrat, was angry that his legislation that would have made clear that the city of McAllen would have had to disclose the terms of its contract with entertainer Enrique Iglesias, who had performed for pay at the city’s holiday season celebration in 2015. Canales blamed a “conspiracy to keep contracts between government (and) corporations secret” for killing the open-government legislation.\nWood, whose open government legislation in 1973 was a priority measure called House Bill 6 and coauthored by more than two dozen members, said it contained ample protections for trade secrets and was never intended to allow governments to spend tax dollars in secret.\nCalls for full review of open government laws\n“I can’t speak to the specifics of the case involving the singer in McAllen, but never was there any expectation that cities could hire entertainers and not tell the public what they were paying them,” he said.\nState Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi, said that even though the open government bills cratered, he and state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, are pushing for a top-to-bottom review of all transparency laws and how they might be approved. The findings would be presented to the next Legislature, Hunter said.\n“Let’s a shine a light on this process and come up with a way to bring back transparency into state government,” he said.\nWood said that considering the present laws trace their roots back 44 years, it’s probably about time.\n“They’ve got to hold public officials accountable,” Wood said. “That’s about as fundamental as it gets.”"},{"url":"http://wamu.org/story/17/05/25/manchester-attack-d-c-security-forces-prepare-memorial-day-crowds","title":"After Manchester Attack, D.C.

Following Monday’s bombing in Manchester, England that killed 22 people, D.C. authorities are stepping up the visibility of security forces.\nThe weekend is jammed-packed with events: Sunday’s lineup includes the Rolling Thunder motorcycle rally, the nationally-televised National Memorial Day Concert outside the Capitol, and a special open house at the Kennedy Center to honor the 100th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy, Jr.’s birth. On Monday, the National Memorial Day Parade will proceed down Constitution Avenue. The Washington Nationals will play three games at Nationals Park over the course of the weekend, and both the Mystics and Valor will hold court at the Verizon Center.\nPeter Newsham, the chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, said his force is well prepared for the crowds. “We’re always ready, being the nation’s capital, to respond if something were to happen on any given weekend,” he told WAMU.\nWhile there are no credible threats right now against D.C., Newsham said in a Thursday interview, the city does increase security after an attack like the one in Manchester, in case someone makes an attempt at a copycat event. Newsham met with his command staff Thursday to encourage them to make officers particularly visible over the holiday weekend.\nA representative from the U.S. Park Police, the law enforcement arm of the National Park Service, declined to comment about the details of security plans over the weekend, but noted that the force is collaborating with agency partners, including the Metropolitan Police Department.\nMany venues in the city also chose not to expound on their security plans for the weekend. The Verizon Center and Nationals Park did not respond to invitations to comment. Audrey Fix Schaefer, the communications director for I.M.P, which manages the 9:30 Club in D.C. and Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Md., declined to comment on security matters.\nTodd Jasper, a security and emergency management expert in D.C., said the reticence stems from caution. Security forces typically do not discuss staffing levels or techniques to avoid revealing information to potential attackers. He said D.C. police do employ some special tactics for big events, including high numbers of plain-clothes officers and bomb-sniffing dogs, high-tech surveillance, and officers trained with high-power patrol rifles to respond to active threats.\n“People don’t necessarily see that very often,” he said. “Most of the stuff that goes on is obviously behind the scenes, but they should know that it’s there.”\nBoth Jasper and Newsham also said that some of the most effective tools at their disposal are the eyes and ears of the community. “There are visible signs that someone might be carrying some sort of weapon or device. We want people to call 911 if they see something suspicious.”"},{"url":"https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/05/29/remembering-a-soldier-who-died-for-his-country-before-becoming-a-citizen","title":"Remembering a Soldier Who Died for His Country Before Becoming a Citizen","author_text":null,"keywords":["Memorial Day","Military","Veterans","Immigration","News","Politics And Government"],"publication_text":"KQED News","description":"George Rincon and Yolanda Reyes remember their son, Diego, an Iraq War veteran who was killed in action in 2003.

Army Pfc. Diego Rincon was one of them.\nIn 1989, his family immigrated to the U.S. from Colombia. In 2003, he was killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq. He died for his country even though he wasn’t a citizen.\nHis parents, George Rincon and Yolanda Reyes, still remember their son and how quickly he adapted to his home in the U.S.\n“We came here when he was 5 years old,” Yolanda says. “Diego started speaking English faster than we did. He was often letting me know, ‘When I finish high school, I’m going to join the Army.’ ”\nDiego did go on to join the Army and he was on his way to becoming a citizen, along with his parents.\n“Before he went to Iraq, he got the green card,” George says. “But he said to me, ‘Dad, don’t do the citizenship until I return.

He asked for forgiveness for anything wrong that he had done, and he said that he loves me. This letter was like a bucket of icy water.”\nDiego died on March 29, 2003.\nWhile his mother was sitting on the steps of the family’s home, a chaplain walked into the house.\n“He said, ‘Mr. Rincon, I’m sorry.

Never fear, we have an all-star lineup of Post writers to guest host the 202 in his absence. Hope everyone enjoyed their Memorial Day break.\nPresident Trump arrived back in Washington after his first overseas trip to find that the Russia tangle has made its way into the White House — in the form of one of the president's closest aides: son-in-law Jared Kushner. Post reporters Ellen Nakashima, Adam Entous and Greg Miller dropped a Friday afternoon bombshell when they reported that Kushner and the seemingly omnipresent Sergey Kislyak — Moscow's ambassador to the United States — had talked about setting up a secret back-channel communication system with the Kremlin. According to U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports, Kushner and Kislyak discussed using Russian diplomatic facilities to shield their conversations from our own country's intelligence apparatus. The move was unusual to say the least — and it happened several weeks before Trump was inaugurated, so Kushner was acting as a private citizen.\nThe meeting was picked up by U.S. intelligence and is said to have occurred between Dec. 1 and 2 at Trump Tower. Another controversial figure was also there — Michael Flynn, who was later ousted as Trump's national security adviser and is refusing to comply with a Senate subpoena demanding a list of his contacts with Russian officials between June 16, 2015, and Jan. 20, 2017. The Senate Intelligence Committee is deciding whether to hold him in contempt.\nUntil last week, it was Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort who seemed to be in the crosshairs of congressional investigators and the FBI, which is probing Russia's suspected meddling in the 2016 campaign and possible ties between Trump aides and Vladimir Putin. Manafort had already been sidelined before the campaign concluded, and Flynn was ousted in February after he was less than candid with Vice President Pence about his conversations with Kislyak. Manafort is taking a different approach to the congressional probes thus far, just last week he submitted 302 pages of documents related to Russia to the House and Senate intelligence panels.\nBut the Kushner situation is different for a number of key reasons.\nFirst, the top White House official is Trump's son-in-law, married to the president's influential daughter Ivanka. Ivanka and Jared, and their children, moved down to Washington to help Trump run the government and the couple, who were by Trump's side during the campaign, are trusted advisers among the president's warring and competitive inner circle. Second, the report that Kushner is now a focus of the FBI probe into Russian interference in the election, brings the Justice Department investigation and recently appointed special counsel Robert Mueller into the inner sanctum of the White House.\nThat is dangerous territory for the president, who could more easily attribute any problems related to Russia to rogue aides like Flynn and Manafort who are no longer advising him. But severing the tie between himself and Jared — whose broad portfolio includes Middle East peace and \"innovation\" — will not be so easy.\nThere was a wealth of reporting on the first son-in-law over the weekend. Most of it suggested that Kushner was readying to fight the idea that he has done anything improper when it comes to Russia. John Wagner, Robert Costa and Ashley Parker reported the president was considering setting up a war room to more quickly combat the endless drip of Russia-related stories: \"Kushner has played an active role in the effort to rethink and rearrange the communications team, improve the White House’s surrogate operation, and develop an internal group to respond to the influx of negative stories and revelations over the FBI’s Russia inquiry, said a person with knowledge of the coming changes.\"\nJohn, Bob and Ashley reported that Kushner's role \"has emerged as a particularly sensitive topic of discussion.... Some White House aides have discreetly discussed among themselves whether Kushner should play a lesser role — or even take a leave — at least until the Russia-related issues calm.\" But here's the key line: \"Those close to Kushner said he has no plans to take a reduced role, although people who have spoken to him say that he is increasingly weary of the nonstop frenzy.\"\nThe New York Times's Glenn Thrush, Maggie Haberman and Sharon LaFraniere reported that Kushner spent the last three days \"in fretful seclusion\" at his father-in-law's estate in Bedminister, N.J.: \"But he emerged defiant and eager to defend his reputation in congressional hearings, according to two of his associates.... But in recent weeks, the Trump-Kushner relationship, the most stable partnership in an often unstable West Wing, is showing unmistakable signs of strain.... It has been duly noted in the White House that Mr. Trump, who feels that he has been ill served by his staff, has increasingly included Mr. Kushner when he dresses down aides and officials, a rarity earlier in his administration and during the campaign.\"\nThe NYT reports that the \"most serious point of contention\" was the pitch by Kushner's sister, Nicole Meyer, to Beijing investors regarding a Kushner Companies condo project in New Jersey. Meyer \"dangled the availability of EB-5 visas to the United States as an enticement for Chinese financiers willing to spend $500,000 or more.\" In another key nugget, the reporters note that Stephen Bannon, Kushner's rival for Trump's attention, refers to Jared as \"'the air,'” because he blows in and out of meetings leaving little trace, according to one senior Trump aide.\"\nThere has been lots of buzz about Trump bringing back some of his more controversial old hands. Last night, for instance:\nSpotted leaving White House tonight: Corey Lewandowski and David Bosse. Both in suits on this Memorial Day, after West Wing meetings.\n— Jeff Zeleny (@jeffzeleny) May 29, 2017\nFor some insight into how Kushner works, don't miss Michael Kranish's and Jonathan O'Connell's revealing piece on how Trump's son-in-law was playing hardball way before he moved to Washington. Michael and Jonathan explain how Jared bought the New York Observer in 2006 after his father went to prison for federal tax evasion. Some former colleagues allege he aimed to use the paper to settle scores with business rivals. Kushner also took charge — at the age of 25 — of his father's real-estate business, paying $1.8 billion in 2007 for the country's most expensive office building. The timing was off — the Great Recession was underway — and the property's value plummeted to about half of what it was worth by 2010. Kushner played hardball with the investors — one of whom was Trump friend Thomas Barrack Jr. Kushner ultimately made a deal to lower his debt and maintain majority ownership in building. Some lenders had hard feelings \"but Kushner viewed it as a hardball business deal and showed that he was a tough negotiator, according to an individual familiar with his perspective. Sources familiar with the arrangement said the Kushner family got back most of its $500 million investment.\"\nRoll Call columnist Walter Shapiro had a blistering column in The Guardian: \"Even under the benign theory that Kushner thought that a secret back channel was like a small boy’s tin-can telephone, his life in the coming months and maybe years will be a study in misery. He will probably spend more time with his personal lawyer, Clinton Justice Department veteran Jamie Gorelick, than with Ivanka or his children. Whether it is an appearance under oath on Capitol Hill or the inevitable FBI interview, every sentence Kushner utters will bring with it possible legal jeopardy.\"\nTo take his White House job, Kushner resigned from the family business but \"kept stakes in about 90 percent of his real estate holdings, valued between $132 million and $407 million,\" which troubles some ethics experts.\nThe NYT on Tuesday examined why Kushner met in mid-December with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov, a close Putin associate whose financial institution is under sanction by the U.S. government. U.S. officials now say the meeting \"may have been part of an effort by Mr. Kushner to establish a direct line to Mr. Putin outside of established diplomatic channels,\" report Matthew Rosenberg, Mark Mazzetti and Maggie Haberman. More from their piece: \"It is not clear whether Mr. Kushner saw the Russian banker as someone who could be repeatedly used as a go-between or whether the meeting with Mr. Gorkov was designed to establish a direct, secure communications line to Mr. Putin.... Yet one current and one former American official with knowledge of the continuing congressional and F.B.I. investigations said they were examining whether the channel was meant to remain open, and if there were other items on the meeting’s agenda, including lifting sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia in response to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and its aggression in Ukraine.\"\nSo far, Trump is sticking by his son-in-law. John Kelly, the Homeland Security Department secretary, said on the Sunday shows that opening a back-channel with Russia was a \"good thing\": “It’s both normal, in my opinion, and acceptable,” Kelly said on ABC News’s “This Week.” “Any way that you can communicate with people, particularly organizations that are maybe not particularly friendly to us is a good thing.” But others disagreed — including ranking House Intelligence Committee Democrat Adam Schiff (Calif.) who called for Kushner's security clearance to be reviewed.\nTrump released this statement to the Times: \"Jared is doing a great job for the country. I have total confidence in him. He is respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars. In addition to that, and perhaps more importantly, he is a very good person.”\nAnd Trump called out the \"fake news\" media in a series of tweets on Sunday, though they didn't mention Kushner by name.\nWe are GROWING!

Philip Rucker reports: “Dubke, who served in the post for three months, tendered his resignation May 18. He offered to stay on to help manage communications in Washington during Trump's foreign trip, and the president accepted.” His last day on the job has not been determined but could be as early as today.\nDubke has worked closely with Sean Spicer in helping manage communications strategy — including responses to crises such as the firing of James Comey and other policy rollouts. “The communications operation — and Dubke and Spicer specifically — have come under sharp criticism from Trump and many senior officials in the West Wing, who believe the president has been poorly served by his staff, in particular in the aftermath of the Comey firing. Dubke was the rare Trump newcomer in a White House in which personal relationships and proximity to the president is the currency. He arrived in mid-February, a few weeks into Trump's term, and struggled to build alliances with some colleagues on the senior staff, not having worked on Trump's campaign or his transition team.\"\n-- DRIP, DRIP DRIP: “Russian government officials discussed having potentially ‘derogatory’ information about then-presidential candidate [Trump] and some of his top aides in conversations intercepted by US intelligence during the 2016 election,” CNN’s Pamela Brown, Jim Sciutto and Dana Bash report: “One source described the information as financial in nature and said the discussion centered on whether the Russians had leverage over Trump's inner circle. The source said the intercepted communications suggested to US intelligence that Russians believed ‘they had the ability to influence the administration through the derogatory information.’\nThe sources cautioned that the Russian claims to one another \"‘could have been exaggerated or even made up,’ as part of a disinformation campaign that the Russians did during the election. [But] the details of the communication shed new light on information US intelligence received about Russian claims of influence, [and] … made clear to US officials that Russia was considering ways to influence the election — even if their claims turned out to be false.”\n-- Gen.

Speaking in a statement just hours after his release from jail, the pro golfer claimed he was suffering from an \"unexpected reaction\" and did not realize the \"mix of medications\" he took had affected him so strongly. Woods suffers from chronic back pain and underwent surgery in April, though it is unclear whether his prescriptions were related to that injury. (Barry Svrluga)\nINSIDE TRUMP’S WASHINGTON — THREE MUST-READ STORIES:\n-- ON HOW TRUMP HANDLES TOP-SECRET INTEL: “[Trump] consumes classified intelligence like he does most everything else in life: ravenously and impatiently, eager to ingest glinting nuggets but often indifferent to subtleties.” Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker report: “Most mornings, often at 10:30 … Trump sits behind the historic Resolute desk and, with a fresh Diet Coke fizzing and papers piled high, receives top-secret updates on the world’s hot spots. The president interrupts his briefers with questions but also with random asides. He asks that the top brass of the intelligence community be present, and he demands brevity.\"\n\"Though career intelligence analysts often take the lead in delivering them, Trump likes his [political appointees] to attend, along with national security adviser H.R. McMaster. [Mike Pompeo and Daniel Coats], whose offices are in McLean, Va., have had to redesign their daily routines so that they spend many mornings at the White House. As they huddle around the desk, Trump likes to pore over visuals — maps, charts, pictures and videos, as well as ‘killer graphics,’ as [Pompeo] phrased it. Yet there are signs that the president may not be retaining all the intelligence he is presented, fully absorbing its nuance, or respecting the sensitivities of the information and how it was gathered....\"\n-- ON HOW HE TREATS HIS CLOSEST AIDES: “Snubs and slights are part of the job in Trump’s White House,” by Ashley Parker: “[Sean Spicer] was giddy at the thought of meeting Pope Francis during President Trump’s first trip abroad, telling acquaintances that for him, a devout Catholic, the moment would fulfill a bucket-list dream. But when the White House finalized the lucky list of staff and family members who would accompany Trump … Spicer’s name was nowhere to be found. [His exclusion] … [stunned] his colleagues, many of whom expressed pity for him and were visibly uncomfortable talking about the slight.… In Trump’s White House, aides serve a president who demands absolute loyalty — but who doesn’t always offer it in return. Trump prefers a management style in which even compliments can come laced with a bite, and where enduring snubs and belittling jokes, even in public, are part of the job.\"\n“The approach, however, frequently leaves Trump’s top team open to some of his more cutting digs. More recently, during a lunch with ambassadors from countries on the U.N. Security Council, Trump jokingly polled those in the room on whether they thought U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, seated directly to his right, was doing a good job. ‘How do you all like Nikki?’ he asked, as she looked on. ‘Otherwise, she can easily be replaced.’\"\n-- ON HOW HE’S “TORTURING CAPITOL HILL”: “A flawed, unpopular health-care bill is stalled in the Senate, the president’s budget proposal has been dismissed out of hand, and hope is fading for other priorities,” The Atlantic’s Molly Ball reports. “‘How do you pack all that in?’ [John McCain] asked last week, adding, ‘So far, I've seen no strategy.… I'm seeing no plan for doing so.’ Meanwhile Democrats sit back and watch it burn, with no small amount of schadenfreude, and the Republicans who never liked Trump see their worst predictions fulfilled. ‘You bought this bad pony. You ride it,’ the anti-Trump consultant Rick Wilson tweeted recently. A staffer to a Senate Republican who did not vote for Trump told me, ‘We didn’t have high expectations, so we’re not disappointed. We tried to warn you.’\"\n“[For] the most part, his party has not openly turned on Trump. [But] behind closed doors … there are differing degrees of fatalism. One group thinks it is possible to fight through the crisis, while another is resigned to ‘a long slow death’ … potentially culminating in a Democratic-controlled House beginning impeachment proceedings in 2019. ‘This is like Reservoir Dogs,’ the staffer said. ‘Everyone ends up dead on the floor.’”\nTHE FALLOUT COULD GO BEYOND WASHINGTON:\n-- New York Times, “‘Narrowcast’ Trump? Republicans Seek Formula to Keep House Majority,” by Jeremy W. Peters: “In the northern suburbs of Atlanta, where what is likely to be the most expensive House campaign in history is being waged, a band of conservative advocacy groups is grappling with a question that may decide whether the Republican Party keeps its House majority after 2018: Do you run with [Trump] or against him? Somehow, the groups are discovering, they will have to do both. The trick for Republicans and their allied outside groups is figuring out how to avoid conspicuously embracing the president without alienating conservative voters who would view any overt rebuff as a betrayal.” “I don’t think you really look to broadcast him,” said Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. “You narrowcast him.”\n“At the other end of the spectrum are groups … determined to keep their distance from Mr. Trump. The Congressional Leadership Fund plans to have at least 20 offices up and running by the end of the year in districts across the country … [which will be] primarily in districts that are a lot like Georgia’s Sixth: suburban centers populated with highly educated, well-off voters who are not terribly enthusiastic about Mr. Trump. The message that groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the Congressional Leadership Fund are pushing in Georgia is Trump-agnostic. The goal is to remind conservative-leaning voters of the common enemy they have in Washington Democrats, even if the headlines about Mr. Trump are too ubiquitous to avoid.”\n-- “In Va. governor’s race, Gillespie in a tight spot on immigration in Trump era,” by Laura Vozzella: “With about three weeks to go before Virginia Republicans pick their nominee for governor, front-runner Ed Gillespie is engaged in an awkward two-step as he tries to appeal to [Trump] voters as well as more mainstream ‘big tent’ Republicans. In TV ads, Gillespie sells himself as a twofer — a seasoned government hand … and Washington insider itching to go to bat for the average Joe. In Facebook ads targeted to the kinds of voters who swept Trump into the White House, the Republican strikes a harder tone, with images of federal immigration agents taking someone away in handcuffs … ‘He’s having to play the hokey pokey a little bit here, one foot in, one foot out,’ said [political scientist] Benjamin Melusky … [Now], Gillespie must figure out how to excite his party’s conservative base without turning off the moderate Republicans and independents essential to winning the swing state. [And if he] wins the nomination, his challenge in the race for the Nov. 7 general election will only get trickier …”\n-- ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION? MIKE PENCE. The vice president is embarking on a cross-country campaign tour this summer amid fears that the Republican Party — reeling from Trump-related controversies — is heading for a midterm election disaster. Politico’s Alex Isenstadt reports: “Pence is mapping out a schedule that will take him through several Midwestern battlegrounds and to traditionally conservative southern states like Georgia, where an unexpectedly competitive June special election runoff is alarming party strategists. The vice president will also attend a series of Republican Party events that will draw major donors and power-brokers, where talk about 2018 is certain to be front-and-center. The push comes at a time of growing consternation among senior Republicans who say the White House has given them little direction on midterm planning. Many complain that they do not even know who to contact about 2018 in an administration that has been consumed by chaos. At the same time, the vice president’s increased electoral activity has stoked speculation that Pence is positioning himself for a post-Trump future in the party, something his advisers strenuously deny.”\n“Next on tap: an early June trip to Iowa, where [Pence] will appear at a barbeque-themed event that will be attended by Sen. Joni Ernst and Gov. Kim Reynolds, the latter of whom is facing a 2018 contest. [Pence] is also likely to be [in] Michigan, where high-profile races for governor and Senate will be on the ballot, and in Wisconsin, where Gov. Scott Walker is seeking reelection.…”\nDISMANTLING CONT.:\n-- The White House is planning to disband the Labor Department division that has policed discrimination among federal contractors for four decades, according to Trump’s proposed budget — a move that comes as part of wider efforts to minimize civil-rights efforts in government agencies. Juliet Eilperin, Emma Brown and Darryl Fears report: “The proposal to dismantle the compliance office comes at a time when the Trump administration is reducing the role of the federal government in fighting discrimination and protecting minorities by cutting budgets, dissolving programs and appointing officials unsympathetic to previous practices.” Other changes outlined in Trump’s budget proposal:\nThe new leadership at the EPA has proposed eliminating its environmental justice program, which addresses pollution that poses health threats concentrated in minority communities and offers money and technical aide to residents confronted with local hazards.\nThe Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights — which has investigated thousands of discrimination complaints and set new standards for how colleges should respond to sexual-assault allegations – would see significant staffing cuts.\nHUD has revoked a rule ensuring that transgender people can stay at sex-segregated shelters of their choice, and HHS removed a question about sexual orientation from two surveys of elderly Americans about services offered or funded by the government.\n-- The Trump administration is moving to roll back a contraceptive coverage mandate for religious employers – seeking to relax a provision that was one of the most hotly contested policies adopted under the Affordable Care Act. The New York Times’ Robert Pear reports: “Because the policy change is embodied in an interim final rule, it could take effect immediately upon publication in the Federal Register. When agencies issue interim final rules, however, they typically invite public comments and can later revise the rules in light of those comments. On its website, the White House [OMB] said it is reviewing an ‘interim final rule’ to relax the requirement, a step that would all but ensure a court challenge by women’s rights groups.\"\n-- Trump tweeted Monday that the stabbing attack on a light-rail train in Portland was “unacceptable,” weighing in for the first time after two people were slain as they confronted a man who was shouting insults against Muslims. Jenna Johnson reports: “The tweet came from the president's official Twitter account, @POTUS, which is chiefly run by his staff, and not from his personal account, @realDonaldTrump, which he controls. Trump has faced criticism for staying quiet about the attack for so many days, even though he is quick to react to violent acts carried out by Muslim extremists.”\nTHERE IS A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n-- Robert Mueller has gotten off to a fast start building his staff and budget in the Russia probe, the Wall Street Journal’s Aruna Viswanatha reports: Mueller is \"building a team, designing a budget and forcing the [FBI] to withhold from Congress documents he may be interested in—all in his first full week on the job. Mr. Mueller’s team has been assigned office space in a nondescript building in downtown Washington that is home to the Justice Department’s civil rights and environment and natural resources divisions. Mr. Mueller and his colleagues have been spotted using their badges to enter the office, conspicuous for their formal attire amid the other Department employees ... Under regulations that govern a special counsel appointment, Mr. Mueller has 60 days from his appointment to develop a proposed budget, to be approved by Mr. Rosenstein. His office is working on that task … [Meanwhile], Mr. Mueller brought two attorneys with him from his former law firm, WilmerHale, and he is expected to recruit additional lawyers from within the Justice Department as he staffs his operation.\"\n-- Sen. John McCain said Vladimir Putin was a bigger threat to America than the Islamic State, characterizing the Russian president in a radio interview Monday as the “premier and most important threat” facing the United States. \"I think ISIS can do terrible things … and I worry about a whole lot of things about it,\" McCain said. \"But it's the Russians … who tried to destroy the very fundamental of democracy, and that is to change the outcome of an American election.\" (Reuters)\nTRUMP'S AMERICA:\nTexas lawmakers got into a heated fight on Monday over the issue of immigration, which was the central theme of Trump's campaign as he vowed to deport illegal immigrants, many of whom he alleged were criminals. He also pledged to build a wall on the United States's southern border, but that campaign promise seems to have been sidelined by the controversies engulfing the White House and amid resistance in Congress.\nSee the fight on the Texas House floor:\n-- Lawmakers scuffled on the floor of the Texas House of Representatives Monday, after a Dallas-area Republican told Democrats that he “called ICE officers” on demonstrators who were chanting and waving signs in protest of a controversial state law that bans sanctuary cities.\nPeter W. Stevenson reports: “We were just on the floor talking about the SB4 protests, and [Rep.] Matt Rinaldi came up to us and made it a point to say, ‘I called [ICE] on all of them,’’ state Rep. Philip Cortez said. ‘And this is completely unacceptable. We will not be intimidated.’\nVideo of the [subsequent] scuffle shows lawmakers pushing one another, yelling and gesticulating. Later, Democrats said, Rinaldi repeatedly got in their faces and cursed at them.” And at one point, language between the lawmakers apparently turned violent. “There was a threat made from Representative Rinaldi to put a bullet in one of my colleagues’ heads,” state Rep. Justin Rodriguez said in a news conference afterwards. But Rinaldi claimed the threat went the other way — that state Rep. Poncho Nevárez “threatened my life on the House floor.” Without audio of the exchange, it’s impossible to determine who threatened whom. But the scuffle shows how the contentious issue of immigration enforcement can stir passions on both sides.\n-- “North Carolina’s battle over voting rights intensifies,” by William Wan: “North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature has worked steadily and forcefully during the past seven years to tilt the state’s election system in its favor, using voting restrictions, favorable district maps and a slew of new policies that lawmakers say are aimed at reducing voter fraud. But at every turn, Democrats and voting rights advocates have stymied their plans, dragging them to court and condemning the GOP actions as discriminatory against the state’s minorities. Instead of giving up — even after two major defeats this month in the U.S. Supreme Court — North Carolina’s Republican leaders are working to push the battle over the ballot box into a new phase. Rumors are circulating here about a new Republican voter identification bill … [and] beyond the voter identification law, almost every aspect of the state’s electoral system is being drawn into this acrimonious political war …”\nAnd the intensifying nature of North Carolina’s ballot-box battle echoes a broader national trend: “North Carolina right now is the canary in the coal mine,” said election law expert Wendy Weiser. “… It gives us a glimpse of where we as a country may be headed if we don’t find a way to apply the brakes on efforts to game the electoral system.”\nWAPO HIGHLIGHTS:\n-- “Syria’s bloodiest battle is yet to come — and 1 million civilians are at risk,” by Louisa Loveluck and Zakaria Zakaria: “They came from every corner of Syria: people who fled fighting but could not afford smugglers’ fees to go farther. Now nearly 1 million are packed into one province in Syria’s northwest, eyeing a weeks-old cease-fire there with trepidation, fear and mistrust. This vast and often hilly expanse along Turkey’s southern border has become the rebels’ final redoubt. In the coming months, it could become the sternest — and the bloodiest — challenge for [Assad’s] forces as they battle to control areas they lost to rebel fighters after the country’s 2011 uprising. A deal brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran this month has stopped much of the violence in Idlib province and three other regions of Syria. But if the truces break down and fighting resumes, the stakes will be highest in the northwest: The Turkish border is tightly controlled, and pro-government forces have been closing in for months. Across the province, a coalition of al-Qaeda-linked rebels would be firmly in Assad’s crosshairs, with hundreds of thousands of civilians stuck in the middle.\nSo the displaced live in permanent flux, doing what they can to outrun the violence and to make ends meet when they arrive at their next destination. Many families live in tents, mud houses or even caves. … For most people, the only way out is with a smuggling network charging extortionate prices — or in an ambulance in the aftermath of an attack.”\n-- “Bulldozers have become more crucial — and more vulnerable — in the fight against the Islamic State,” by Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Mustafa Salim: “On the front lines, the jagged teeth of a young soldier’s bulldozer mark the beginning of Iraq’s territory and the end of the Islamic State’s. Pvt. Mohammed Ali al-Shwele is 19, weathered and lean. He has been shot at, rocketed and mortared while trying to protect the troops behind him. [He], and the cadre of bulldozer drivers like him, are responsible for moving the war forward one block at a time. Bulldozers were essential to Iraqi forces as they pushed through Ramadi, Fallujah and eastern Mosul. [And] in western Mosul … the machines have become more crucial — and more of a target — than ever. Soldiers such as Shwele, and the construction equipment they pilot, provide insight into what the fighting in the city has turned into after eight months of near-continuous combat. The battle is a daily grind, and despite the presence of drones, GPS-guided artillery and U.S. jets, the best way forward is still behind a mobile wall of steel.” “There can be no liberation without the bulldozer,” Shwele said.\nSee this armored bulldozer get hit by a car bomb in Mosul:\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\nTrump celebrated Memorial Day on Twitter:\nTrump paid his respects to the late Marine 1st Lt.

Its most recent valuation, of $68 billion in 2015, was the highest ever given to a private company. Uber itself, however, has lately become a monument not only to the power of technology and confidence in the face of adversarial forces but possibly to the dangers of hubris: When you’re worth that much money on imaginary paper, and buoyed by the belief that you’re on a mission to change the world, it can be easy to sweep aside concerns like ‘rampant sexual harassment’ and ‘public relations’ and ‘profits …’”\n-- New York Times, “How a Candy Heir Sneaked Into Pro Hockey and Made His Name as a ‘Savage,’” by Jason Buckland: “Nello Ferrara was being groomed to take the reins of a famed confectioner, but chose to cobble together a decade-long career with 19 minor league teams.”\nHOT ON THE LEFT:\n“Portland Republican says party should use militia groups after racial attack,” from The Guardian: “As tensions continue in Portland following the racially charged murder of two men on Friday, the top Republican in the city said he is considering using militia groups as security for public events.

Because there are now belligerent, unstable people who are convinced that Republicans are like Nazis.”\nHOT ON THE RIGHT\n“These 8th-graders from New Jersey refused to be photographed with Paul Ryan,” from Peter Jamison: “For students across the country, the traditional eighth-grade trip to Washington is a chance to join the throngs on the Mall and perhaps spot some of the world’s most powerful people on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. But a group from South Orange Middle School in New Jersey may remember their trip to the nation’s capital last week for another reason: It was the occasion for a pointed snub of House Speaker [Paul Ryan]. Dozens of the 218 students on the trip refused to have their photo taken with Ryan when he briefly joined them outside the capitol Thursday, students on the trip said. [Those students] stood across the street while Ryan posed with their peers.

Now it looks like a fortress designed to keep them out. The concrete façade of the empty department store looms large at one end, the letters that once spelled ‘JC Penney’ removed but their outline still present. A recently shuttered movie theater anchors the mall’s middle, its dark glass foreboding. And at the other end, an MC Sports store is draped in garish yellow and red signs that read “STORE CLOSING” and “EVERYTHING MUST GO.”\nInside the mall, the majority of the stores are empty, their gates locked. Only a few bother to put up “for lease” signs. In the past few years, this mall has lost JC Penney and Macy’s, American Eagle, Christopher \u0026 Banks, Rue21, Deb Shops, Vanity, and Kays, to name a few, according to Brenda LaBonte, the mall’s manager. The few that remain—a CVS, a Claire’s Boutique, and a Hot Topic—were empty on a recent weekday evening.\nScenes like this are playing out across America. As my colleague Derek Thompson has pointed out, the reasons for the decline of malls are multifold: People are buying more things online, developers built too many malls in the 1980s and 1990s, and consumers are now spending more on services and less on material goods.\nBut these changing in spending habits have big implications for the counties and towns that depend on retail for sales- and income-tax revenue. Many of the areas affected by retail closures have already weathered other departures: factories closing, young people departing for bigger cities, home values dropping. The constant departure of more retail stores is another blow. Counties in Ohio, for instance, get half of their budget from the sales tax that they levy on top of the state’s 5.75 percent rate, according to Suzanne Dulaney, the executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Ohio.\nNationwide, sales taxes comprise nearly one-third of the taxes that state governments collect and about 12 percent of what local governments collect, according to Lucy Dadayan, a senior researcher at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, a New York-based research group. “The epic closures of the brick-and-mortar stores is troubling news for state and local government sales-tax collections,” she said. They’re already feeling the hit: States’ tax revenues grew just 1.9 percent between 2014 and 2015, after growing 5.8 percent in the previous four quarters, according to the Rockefeller Institute. Local-government sales-tax collections grew just 1.7 percent, after growing 7.5 percent in the previous four quarters. In Ohio, state tax revenues grew just 0.1 percent, when adjusted for inflation, between 2015 and 2016, according to Dadayan. When revenues don’t continue to grow, governments have to slow down spending and can’t readily invest in long-term projects.\n“The mall has been slowly shrinking,” Richard Lohnes, a commissioner in Clark County, where the Upper Valley Mall is located, told me. “And losing any retail business has an impact on Clark County—it has hurt.” The county is bracing for more impacts—the Sears at the Upper Valley Mall may soon close, Lohnes said, even as the mall tries to attract new businesses in to fill empty stores.\nClark County is not alone. In the southeastern part of Ohio, near the border with West Virginia, Belmont County gets $17 million of its $22 million budget from sales-tax revenues, Mark Thomas, a county supervisor, told me. The county has lost a bevy of retailers of late, including Elder-Beerman, Hhgregg, MC Sports, and Radio Shack. A Kmart in St. Clairsville is expected to close soon, according to the company. The decline in sales tax isn’t the only thing that hurts revenues—abandoned malls mean less revenue from commercial property taxes too. Local governments also see lower income taxes and, when retail workers are unemployed, they spend less, creating a vicious cycle of less and less revenue. “That trickle-down effect is huge,” Thomas said.\nThe retail closures are affecting regions that already have their fair share of economic problems. These are places where many factories and businesses have already shut down, and where consumers have less money to spend than they used to. Springfield, where the Upper Valley Mall is located, saw its median incomes shrink more than anywhere else in the country, falling 27 percent between 1994 and 2014, according to the Pew Research Center. Many manufacturing jobs have been automated, new jobs that have come in are lower-paying ones in call centers and in retail, according to Springfield’s mayor, Warren Copeland. That hurts the city, which charges its own local income tax. “If retail starts going away, that’s a new hit. That’s a serious threat that we recognize,” he said.\nStates that have seen manufacturing companies depart are bearing much of the brunt of the retail closures, according to Dadayan’s research. She tabulated where Macys, Kmart, and Sears have announced in the past year that they are planning to close stores, and found that Pennsylvania will have the most of those total store closings, at 16. Ohio and Michigan have the second-highest number, at 15 each, alongside Florida. Other states that have bigger populations have much lower combined closings. California, for example, only has eight.\nThe closures raise the question of what state and local governments will do if retail continues to evaporate. Already, many local governments are attempting to raise taxes to make up for budget shortfalls. Springfield asked voters to approve an income tax in November; the measure failed. The sales-tax rate at both the local and state levels has been creeping up in Ohio as governments try to raise taxes to make up for declines, according to Jon Honeck, the acting director of the Greater Ohio Policy Center, a local think tank. Ohio has also cut back on revenue-sharing between states and local governments since the election of Governor John Kasich in 2010, making it more difficult for local governments to make ends meet. “Some have just cut services, since the state is not going to help them out,” Honeck said.\nThe decline of brick-and-mortar retail creates social challenges in addition to financial ones. When people aren’t going to stores to shop, and are instead shopping online, the vibrancy of local communities that once depended on foot traffic fades. The Upper Valley Mall was eerily quiet when I walked through it on a recent weekday night.\nThe decline of brick-and-mortar retail isn’t hitting every region equally. As stores close in less-populated areas and governments struggle to find revenue sources, some big cities are actually opening more retail stores, Honeck said. This could be because areas like Columbus are adding to their population while other cities, like Springfield, are shrinking. Shoppers are also increasingly driving to new malls in bigger cities, rather than shop close to home, he said.\nRelated Stories\nColumbus also has a higher labor-force participation rate and lower poverty rates than other regions throughout Ohio. And developers are paying attention. While dead and dying malls are scattered around Ohio, for instance, a new outlet mall recently opened near Columbus. And counties with big, new malls collect a higher share of sales tax than those with older or dying properties, Honeck’s group found. “The large municipalities are really starting to pull away from the small or mid-sized ones,” Torey Hollingsworth, the manager of research and policy at the Greater Ohio Policy Center, said.\nThere might be a fix for the discrepancy in sales-tax collections: Congress could act to require online retailers to collect sales tax and remit it to the states. National legislators have debated bills that would allow states to collect income taxes on online sales, but efforts have thus far been ad hoc. “We are living in a completely different society, and I think there should be tax reform on a Congressional level, amended for the collection of online sales tax,” Dadayan, of the Rockefeller Institute, said. “This should be taken care of—otherwise state and local governments are going to suffer significantly in the coming years.” This won’t, of course, address the challenges that many of these struggling regions will face in upcoming years as jobs disappear and retailers continue to shut down. Those are bigger challenges, for which there are no clear policy solutions. But helping these shrinking regions collect sales tax from the people who still live there, and who still buy things, may be a start.\nThis article originally appeared on The Atlantic."},{"url":"https://theconversation.com/7-in-10-smartphone-apps-share-your-data-with-third-party-services-72404","title":"7 in 10 smartphone apps share your data with third-party services","author_text":"Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Conversation","description":"When smartphone apps get permission to access your location or other activity, they often share that data with other companies that can compile digital profiles on users.","date":"","full_text":"Our mobile phones can reveal a lot about ourselves: where we live and work; who our family, friends and acquaintances are; how (and even what) we communicate with them; and our personal habits.

And some of the information these apps are collecting are necessary for them to work properly: A map app wouldn’t be nearly as useful if it couldn’t use GPS data to get a location.\nBut once an app has permission to collect that information, it can share your data with anyone the app’s developer wants to – letting third-party companies track where you are, how fast you’re moving and what you’re doing.\nThe help, and hazard, of code libraries\nAn app doesn’t just collect data to use on the phone itself. Mapping apps, for example, send your location to a server run by the app’s developer to calculate directions from where you are to a desired destination.\nThe app can send data elsewhere, too. As with websites, many mobile apps are written by combining various functions, precoded by other developers and companies, in what are called third-party libraries. These libraries help developers track user engagement, connect with social media and earn money by displaying ads and other features, without having to write them from scratch.\nHowever, in addition to their valuable help, most libraries also collect sensitive data and send it to their online servers – or to another company altogether. Successful library authors may be able to develop detailed digital profiles of users. For example, a person might give one app permission to know their location, and another app access to their contacts. These are initially separate permissions, one to each app. But if both apps used the same third-party library and shared different pieces of information, the library’s developer could link the pieces together.\nUsers would never know, because apps aren’t required to tell users what software libraries they use. And only very few apps make public their policies on user privacy; if they do, it’s usually in long legal documents a regular person won’t read, much less understand.\nDeveloping Lumen\nOur research seeks to reveal how much data are potentially being collected without users’ knowledge, and to give users more control over their data. To get a picture of what data are being collected and transmitted from people’s smartphones, we developed a free Android app of our own, called the Lumen Privacy Monitor. It analyzes the traffic apps send out, to report which applications and online services actively harvest personal data.\nBecause Lumen is about transparency, a phone user can see the information installed apps collect in real time and with whom they share these data. We try to show the details of apps’ hidden behavior in an easy-to-understand way. It’s about research, too, so we ask users if they’ll allow us to collect some data about what Lumen observes their apps are doing – but that doesn’t include any personal or privacy-sensitive data. This unique access to data allows us to study how mobile apps collect users’ personal data and with whom they share data at an unprecedented scale.\nIn particular, Lumen keeps track of which apps are running on users’ devices, whether they are sending privacy-sensitive data out of the phone, what internet sites they send data to, the network protocol they use and what types of personal information each app sends to each site. Lumen analyzes apps traffic locally on the device, and anonymizes these data before sending them to us for study: If Google Maps registers a user’s GPS location and sends that specific address to maps.google.com, Lumen tells us, “Google Maps got a GPS location and sent it to maps.google.com” – not where that person actually is.\nTrackers are everywhere\nMore than 1,600 people who have used Lumen since October 2015 allowed us to analyze more than 5,000 apps. We discovered 598 internet sites likely to be tracking users for advertising purposes, including social media services like Facebook, large internet companies like Google and Yahoo, and online marketing companies under the umbrella of internet service providers like Verizon Wireless.\nWe found that more than 70 percent of the apps we studied connected to at least one tracker, and 15 percent of them connected to five or more trackers. One in every four trackers harvested at least one unique device identifier, such as the phone number or its device-specific unique 15-digit IMEI number. Unique identifiers are crucial for online tracking services because they can connect different types of personal data provided by different apps to a single person or device. Most users, even privacy-savvy ones, are unaware of those hidden practices.\nMore than just a mobile problem\nTracking users on their mobile devices is just part of a larger problem. More than half of the app-trackers we identified also track users through websites. Thanks to this technique, called “cross-device” tracking, these services can build a much more complete profile of your online persona.\nAnd individual tracking sites are not necessarily independent of others. Some of them are owned by the same corporate entity – and others could be swallowed up in future mergers. For example, Alphabet, Google’s parent company, owns several of the tracking domains that we studied, including Google Analytics, DoubleClick or AdMob, and through them collects data from more than 48 percent of the apps we studied.\nUsers’ online identities are not protected by their home country’s laws. We found data being shipped across national borders, often ending up in countries with questionable privacy laws. More than 60 percent of connections to tracking sites are made to servers in the U.S., U.K., France, Singapore, China and South Korea – six countries that have deployed mass surveillance technologies. Government agencies in those places could potentially have access to these data, even if the users are in countries with stronger privacy laws such as Germany, Switzerland or Spain.\nEven more disturbingly, we have observed trackers in apps targeted to children. By testing 111 kids’ apps in our lab, we observed that 11 of them leaked a unique identifier, the MAC address, of the Wi-Fi router it was connected to. This is a problem, because it is easy to search online for physical locations associated with particular MAC addresses. Collecting private information about children, including their location, accounts and other unique identifiers, potentially violates the Federal Trade Commission’s rules protecting children’s privacy.\nJust a small look\nAlthough our data include many of the most popular Android apps, it is a small sample of users and apps, and therefore likely a small set of all possible trackers. Our findings may be merely scratching the surface of what is likely to be a much larger problem that spans across regulatory jurisdictions, devices and platforms.\nIt’s hard to know what users might do about this. Blocking sensitive information from leaving the phone may impair app performance or user experience: An app may refuse to function if it cannot load ads. Actually, blocking ads hurts app developers by denying them a source of revenue to support their work on apps, which are usually free to users.\nIf people were more willing to pay developers for apps, that may help, though it’s not a complete solution. We found that while paid apps tend to contact fewer tracking sites, they still do track users and connect with third-party tracking services.\nTransparency, education and strong regulatory frameworks are the key. Users need to know what information about them is being collected, by whom, and what it’s being used for. Only then can we as a society decide what privacy protections are appropriate, and put them in place. Our findings, and those of many other researchers, can help turn the tables and track the trackers themselves."},{"url":"https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/dem-mayor-and-gop-gov-align-on-transpo-plan","title":"Dem Mayor and GOP Gov Align on Transpo Plan","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Nashville’s chief exec likes the power cities would get to fund transit.","date":"","full_text":"In January, Tennessee Governor (and Republican) Bill Haslam announced a proposal to increase the state gas tax. According to The Tennessean, Nashville Mayor (and Democrat) Megan Barry is loudly cheering it on — everywhere from the local airwaves to the rotary club.\n“Let’s talk about my main priorities: transit, transit, transit,” she said at a luncheon this week, the Tennessean reports.\nOf prime interest to Barry is the revenue the tax would generate — and she’s singled out $1.4 billion in projects it could address. She also supports the fact that the governor’s plan would enable Tennessee cities to hold public referendums “to let voters decide whether to impose a surcharge on sales tax to fund public transit projects,” according to the newspaper.\nThe gas tax, which Haslam pushed during his State of the State address this week, calls for a 7-cent increase on gasoline and a 12-cent increase on diesel, WBIR reports. It would generate upward of $270 million for road and transportation projects, with the average driver paying about $4 more a month, according to the Tennessean.\nLast fall, Barry and several other Tennessee mayors embraced a $6 billion regional transit system project that would include light rail, commuter rail and bus rapid transit. That “big vision” (and “big price tag”) haven’t exactly been unanimously popular, as Next City has previously covered.\nBut many Nashville leaders see a need for change in how residents move around the city. In 2015, a delegation of more than a hundred Nashville civic and business leaders visited Salt Lake City to ride trains, listen to speakers and generally get a read on the Utah region’s relatively efficient system.\n“It really is becoming more and more difficult to get around [Nashville],” Steve Bland, CEO of Nashville’s Metropolitan Transit Authority, said after the visit. “We can’t layer on a million more people unless we do something different.”"},{"url":"http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2016/dec/07/recognizing-racial-injustice-incarceration","title":"Recognizing Racial Injustice in Incarceration","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"Criminal-justice reforms are not only necessary for cost savings to the state but also a necessity to work toward a more equitable justice system.","date":"","full_text":"Criminal-justice reforms are not only necessary for cost savings to the state but also a necessity to work toward a more equitable justice system. The Legislature recognizes the cost-savings aspect of reforms, particularly in the midst of slashing the state budget for corporate tax cuts, but understanding who criminal-justice reforms impact is just as important as understanding how many pennies the state can save.\nLeaders in the Mississippi Department of Corrections and prosecutors in the state have both expressed interest in more community corrections and the necessity of alternative programs for inmates with addiction and mental-health conditions. The shift in mentality needs to be followed with dollars. We cannot continue to incarcerate men and women who are in need of treatment for their substance abuse or trauma-induced mental-health conditions.\nThe Corrections and Criminal Justice Oversight Task Force continued to monitor the implementation of the state's big criminal justice reform legislation after its implementation in 2014, and it continues to see opportunities to improve Mississippi's incarceration system. The task force will present its report to leaders on Dec. 12, asking them to consider specific appropriations for transitional housing, encouraging mental-health courts and community corrections, as well as increasing the capacity of drug courts statewide. Alternatives to incarceration in a 24-hour facility are significantly cheaper, so cost savings are not arguable.\nThe people of Mississippi and future generations are at stake. As of Nov. 1, 63 percent of inmates in MDOC's custody are African American. Black males alone make up 60 percent of inmates. Reforms are important and critical because these numbers are echoed to the younger generation. The 2015 Division of Youth Services report shows that 63 percent of youth referred to youth court for delinquent acts are African American.\nThe rates of incarceration almost equal the inverse of the state's population demographics: African Americans make up 37 percent of Mississippi's population, 2015 census data show, but they make up 63 percent of our adult- and youth-corrections population. The only systemic way to stop these cycles in their tracks is at the highest level: policy. Or as the president of the Schott Foundation for Public Education, John H. Jackson, says: \"Programs are progress, but policy is power.\"\nThe Legislature holds the keys and the power to change the trajectory of corrections in the state. With great power comes great opportunity: an opportunity to change the outlook for more than 10,000 kids (some as young as 7 years old) who are already involved with the justice system. New policies mean investments, but if it's the future of the state at risk, it's worth it. The Legislature needs to not only address the task force's recommendations and fund them for adult corrections but also needs to address desperately needed reforms at the youth-court level as well. Future generations of Mississippians depend on this progress; it's time to act like it.\nSponsored"},{"url":"http://www.politico.com/sponsor-content/2017/05/model-of-recovery-for-americas-cities?sr_source=lift_amplify\u0026cid=20175mag","title":"Sponsored Content: Unlocking the power of U.S. cities","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"","date":"","full_text":"Detroit has a way with comebacks. In 1933, the city began emerging from the Great Depression with a little help from public-private-partnerships. Spurred by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the federal agency mandated with stabilizing U.S. banks, the National Bank of Detroit (NBD) was formed. On its opening day on March 24, 1933, customers swarmed the new NBD to open 562 accounts, bringing in bundles of currency and coins ranging from a few hundred dollars to hundreds of thousands. America’s “Motor City” was on the mend.\nToday, Detroit’s recent revitalization bears some resemblance to the past. Despite shifts in the city’s biggest industry, residents of the Motor City spend money with local businesses at a rate greater than other U.S. cities, powering the local economy. It’s clear that any solution to Detroit’s challenges has to start at the community level.\nThis is also why public-private-partnerships continue to play a crucial role. In 2013, the Mayor’s office and a range of local groups including JPMorgan Chase – which has been in Detroit for more than 80 years and acquired the NBD during that time – helped fuel a recovery focused on stabilizing neighborhoods, re-training the workforce for today’s job market and bolstering local small businesses, all while attracting new investors. JPMorgan Chase was an early leader in this strategy, committing $100 million in 2014 with plans to expand that to $150 million by 2019. And the work underway in the city has helped JPMorgan Chase develop and refine its approach to creating economic opportunity – resulting in a model that can be applied elsewhere.\nFor a city that was losing population just four years ago, the latest indicators are encouraging: Unemployment has nearly halved and 8,000 more Detroiters are working now than at this time last year. The downtown area, once blighted and abandoned, is flourishing with restaurants and businesses. Some 2,000 vacant homes are being rehabbed and reoccupied.\nBut Detroit’s recovery is not just the feel-good story of America’s rustbelt – it’s a lesson in urban revival. The city’s revitalization is about more than access to capital. It’s about collaboration and public-private-partnership.

The change is huge for low-income students, who can now get summer college courses covered by the needs-based federal financial aid program. That can make it more likely that they’ll graduate.\nBut it seems doubtful that the new aid will be available this summer. The Education Department is supposed to issue guidance on how colleges can start distributing the aid, but not until July 1, and that won’t give them enough time to put systems in place to make it happen.\n“The money was appropriated for this fiscal year [which ends September 30] so there was a hope that it could be used for this summer,” said Kelly McManus, director of government affairs at The Education Trust. “But given that they won’t get guidance until July, I would be hard pressed to see how they could use it.”\nRelated: Colleges confront the simple math that keeps students from graduating on time\nA check with several financial aid directors found that most agree – the guidance simply will come too late in the game.\nThey are preparing for next summer, however. More than 600 students who are eligible for Pell enrolled in classes this summer at Clayton State University in Georgia, but will likely have to take out loans to pay for them because they have exhausted all the Pell they can use for this year, said Lakisha Sanders, Clayton’s director of financial aid.\nStill, the college is getting ready to launch an awareness campaign in the fall when most students return. They’ll be using all the publicity tools at their disposal – emails, texts, PowerPoint presentations and posters on campus, as well as post cards and phone calls to families, according to Stephen Schultheis, Clayton’s vice president for enrollment management.\nSince the budget agreement only lasts through September 30, Congress will be back at it after the August recess, trying to hammer out a new agreement. That raises the question of whether year-round Pell will wither away before anyone gets to use it.\n“Anything can happen but I think it is very, very unlikely that Congress will back off on this,” said Jessica Thompson, policy and research director at the Institute for College Access and Success. “It is very, very popular with institutions and has bipartisan support; and the [Trump] administration has indicated support.”\nNonetheless, educators note that President Obama hadn’t intended to curtail year-round Pell in 2011 – but it happened in budget negotiations with the Republican-led Congress that year.\n“I don’t believe the intent is to bring it back for just one year,” said Ralph Buxton, financial aid director at the Borough of Manhattan Community College at the City University of New York, “but Obama had to bargain it away, and in this environment everything’s so unsure.”\nThe push for college completion has increased in the past several years, however, and research indicates that students who take summer classes are more likely to graduate, so colleges hope it will become a permanent part of the financial aid landscape.\nOne thing year-round Pell has going for it is that the change does not increase the maximum amount of Pell money that a student can receive in his or her lifetime. The change simply provides flexibility for when a student can use it.\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

His campaign for public and private funding for the projects is expected to run from the Rose Garden, where he’ll speak about upgrading air traffic control, to Ohio and Kentucky on inland waterways and through meetings with mayors, governors and Transportation Department officials.\nThe Trump administration has struggled to gain traction on many of its economic policies. Job growth has slowed in recent months instead of accelerating as the president predicted. Trump has said he has tax legislation moving through Congress but his effort has been stalled and no bill has been written. His budget plan released during his foreign trip included math errors that enabled the White House to falsely claim that its tax plan would deliver both faster growth and a balanced budget.\nTrump’s agenda has been overshadowed by ongoing probes into whether Trump campaign officials or associates colluded with Russian officials to influence the 2016 election, as well as scrutiny over Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey — who is scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday.\nAnd other policies on the agenda, such as health care and taxes, come first on a fast-closing legislative calendar.\nBut modernizing the nation’s infrastructure remains a challenge with broad public support.\nTrump’s push to revamp deteriorating roads, bridges, airports and railways aims to unlock economic growth and succeed in an area where his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, was repeatedly thwarted by a Republican-led Congress.\n“It doesn’t matter who you are, whether you are farmer in the Midwest, or a mother driving your kids to and from school, or a worker or a college kid flying back and forth to school, you’re affected by infrastructure,” said White House economic adviser Gary Cohn in a conference call with reporters.\nCohn said the nation was “falling behind and the falling behind is affecting economic growth in the United States. The president wants to fix the problems and he doesn’t want to push these liabilities into the future.”\nTrump on Monday is set to outline his legislative principles for overhauling the air traffic control system, using a Rose Garden address to propose separating air traffic control operations from the Federal Aviation Administration, a key priority for U.S. airlines.\nThe president plans to travel to Ohio and Kentucky on Wednesday to address ways of improving levees, dams and locks along inland waterways that are crucial to agricultural exports. His visit is expected to include a speech expected to touch on partnering with states and local governments.\nCohn said governors and mayors are scheduled meet with Trump at the White House on Thursday for a listening session focused on the efficient use of tax dollars for infrastructure projects.\nOn Friday, Trump will visit the Transportation Department to discuss regulatory changes related to roads and railways. Trump has noted that the approval process for permits frequently can drag on for a decade and has pressed to shorten the length of the review process.\nTrump’s focus on infrastructure follows the government’s monthly jobs report, which showed hiring slowing down in May. The economy has added an average of 121,000 jobs over the past three months, down from a monthly average of nearly 187,000 last year despite Trump’s promotion of his economic prescriptions.\nOn infrastructure, the administration has pointed to plans for a package of tax breaks meant to help spur $1 trillion in new spending on roads, bridges and other construction during the next decade. It also would drastically shorten project approval times. According to Trump’s budget proposal, the funding would come from $200 billion in tax breaks over nine years that would then — in theory — leverage $1 trillion worth of construction.\nA senior White House official has said the infrastructure plan might also incentivize local governments to sell their existing infrastructure to private firms.\nBut Democrats have warned that the Trump budget reduces infrastructure spending elsewhere, including cuts to Amtrak subsidies, the elimination of an infrastructure investment program started under Obama and a more than $90 billion drop-off in congressional support for the Highway Trust Fund over 10 years.\nDemocrats have also been critical of Trump’s interest in forging public-private partnerships instead of more traditional spending on infrastructure projects. At the same time, many conservative Republicans have been wary of the idea of a massive government investment.\nAnd with Republicans in control of Congress, Democrats have shown little appetite for working with the president as he faces inquiries into Russia and takes a combative approach overall, from Comey’s firing to the withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.\n“If the obstructionists want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists,” Trump said Thursday, discussing his plans to exit the Paris climate pact. “We will all sit down and we will get back into the deal. And we’ll make it good, and we won’t be closing up our factories, and we won’t be losing our jobs.”"},{"url":"http://khn.org/news/cuts-in-federal-housing-help-would-hurt-peoples-health-research-suggests","title":"Cuts In Federal Housing Help Would Hurt People’s Health, Research Suggests","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Kaiser Health News","description":"A study in Health Affairs shows that people who receive federal housing vouchers and other forms of public housing assistance are more likely to have health insurance and get regular medical care.","date":"2017-06-05","full_text":"Does investing in public housing keep people healthier?\nNew research explores this question, which appears timely, especially as the Trump administration proposes to cut $7.4 billion — about 15 percent — from the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s budget, and HUD Secretary Ben Carson argues that too much government assistance fosters dependency and perpetuates cycles of poverty.\nThe study, published Monday in the journal Health Affairs, found that receiving housing assistance from the federal government — through vouchers, public housing and subsidies for so-called multifamily homes — also increased people’s likelihood of having health insurance and access to regular care. These findings add to a growing body of evidence that suggests stable housing — in particular, the kind of federal housing assistance now on the chopping block — could help its recipients better manage their health.\n“This income boost people are getting through housing assistance can free up scarce resources to be spent on other things,” said Andrew Fenelon, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health and one of the paper’s authors. “We haven’t had [before] this clear evidence that these housing assistance programs … actually lead to improved health.”\nTo figure this out, the researchers used a nationally representative sample of non-elderly, non-disabled adults surveyed from 2004 to 2012. Using data collected by HUD, they checked whether people with housing assistance got insurance and medical care. Those responses were then compared with responses to the same survey given by people who did not have housing at the time of the survey but qualified within two years — respondents with presumably similar life circumstances.\nThe findings: Of people who received federal aid, about 31.8 percent lacked health insurance, compared with about 37.2 percent of those who would later qualify. People with aid were also more likely to get medical care when needed.\nAs policymakers consider both health care and housing, that link suggests investing in these assistance programs could yield benefits on both fronts. Lawmakers are already looking for ways to improve access to health insurance and care. But the Trump administration’s proposed HUD budget, experts say, would result in $1.8 billion in cuts for public housing — an area some worry is already under-resourced — and could eliminate about 250,000 housing vouchers. The budget has already elicited criticism from both sides of the aisle — with multiple Republican senators calling it “dead on arrival” — but, some say, it could generally indicate policy areas that are most vulnerable in the administration.\n“The cuts that are proposed in the budget will mean more people are struggling to find affordable and stable housing,” said Elizabeth Kneebone, a fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program. “This study suggests that can also have effects on other things, like access to health care and health insurance.”\nMartha Weatherspoon, an Avon sales representative in Clarksville, Tenn., understands this reality. Weatherspoon, 54, has lived in public housing since 1997. If the proposed funding cuts happen, she would have to move to Florida, she said. There, she has family and thinks she would have better luck finding something affordable.\nWeatherspoon said relocating is an option because she no longer has to provide housing or health insurance for anyone else. Her only child is now an adult, with her own home and income. But many of her neighbors, who work minimum-wage jobs and have families, don’t have this flexibility. They rely on these subsidies.\nWithout that aid, “you’re talking anywhere from $600 to $1,500, depending on things like the size of the bedroom,” she said. “The number of hours you would have to work … just to pay the rent — it’s costly.”\nThe funding cuts would not just crowd out people’s budgets for health insurance and care, Kneebone said, they would stoke the need for those very services. If people don’t have a regular, stable home to go to — or if that home isn’t properly maintained — they can become sicker, physically and mentally.\nAnd federal allocations to public housing and housing assistance have shrunk in recent years, so public housing already faces issues when it comes to regular upkeep. Meanwhile, research increasingly suggests where one lives influences health and health needs.\nFor instance, Weatherspoon’s daughter is asthmatic, a condition that may have been exacerbated by the quality of their housing — a unit more than 60 years old that, to her recollection, has not been renovated while she has lived there.\n“A lot of folks in public housing — the kids do have a medical condition,” she said. Many homes, she added, have black mold in the walls, which is toxic. If the government puts even less into maintaining public housing than what’s already put in, she asked, “will it be safe?”\nThe result is a double bind of sorts, Fenelon said. Just when people have fewer free dollars to pay for health care, their health worsens — meaning their need for care is even greater.\n“Providing housing for people isn’t just a housing issue. It’s an issue of health and well-being,” Fenelon said. “To the extent that the new budget passes and leads to people losing their housing assistance, we’re also talking about people losing their health care.”"},{"url":"http://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2017/05/30/new-owner-waupacas-indian-crossing-casino-plans-make-dance-hall-rock-once-again/336221001","title":"New owner of Waupaca's Indian Crossing Casino plans to make dance hall rock once again","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"Post-Crescent Media","description":"The historic dance hall, located about 10 minutes west of town on the Chain O'Lakes, reopened with a bang this weekend.","date":"","full_text":"WAUPACA - Brian Wagner wants the Indian Crossing Casino to rock once again.\nThe historic dance hall, located about 10 minutes west of town on the Chain O'Lakes, reopened with a bang Memorial Day weekend. A Saturday night BoDeans concert sold out, drawing a large happy crowd of well over 500.\nThat's the way new owner Wagner wants the summers to be at the Casino, which gets its name from being a gathering place rather than a gambling hall. The Casino is one the last remaining dance halls of its type — not unlike the famous Surf Ballroom in Iowa that hosted Buddy Holly's last show.\n\"This used to be the entertainment hub for central Wisconsin,\" said Wagner, who brings experience in real estate development, the bar and restaurant business, and social media savvy to a very old business.\n\"I'm very choosy in the place I pick,\" he said. \"It's got to have an amazing, unique feature.\"\nIn the case of the Casino, there are several such features, including a waterfront porch and grounds, and a large auditorium with a wooden floor that just begs to be danced on. Performers admire the acoustics of the room.\n\"That channel out front is the main highway for these lakes,\" Wagner said. \"And the size of that room gives you the opportunity to be able to bring in national acts.\"\nIt's not that the joint has been closed, but in recent years visitors to this busy summer vacation area were uncertain when the Casino would be open. That's in part because it's a popular spot for wedding receptions, and the previous owners would close to the public on those nights.\nThat will change under Wagner, who owns two bars in Oshkosh — Bar 430 and Peabody's Ale House.\nWagner has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into Casino renovations, including a new kitchen and beer garden. It's a gutsy move for a seasonal business that's heavily dependent on the weather.\n\"We're going to be open every day, even on days when we have a wedding reception,\" Wagner said.\nThat's great news to generations of visitors who have memories of summer nights hanging out on the Casino's porch, overlooking the channel connecting Columbia and Limekiln lakes.\n\"This is going to be great,\" said Mark Kellermann, 67, of Neenah, as he surveyed a freshly landscaped beer garden overlooking Columbia Lake. \"If he gets some good bands here, he's going to do really well.\"\nWagner's day job is as vice president of operations for a web development company that's based in California. He's promoting the refreshed Casino on Facebook and on local radio, which is where Kellermann heard about it.\nThe Casino opened on July 4, 1925 — before the big band era —- and featured \"programs that would be of interest to most of the dancing public,\" according to a Waupaca County Post article.\n\"Monday nights were billed as 'Waltz Nights,' \" the article says. \"Every other dance would be a waltz, and a waltz contest would be held at 10:30, with prizes given.\"\nWednesday and Friday evenings were “Get Acquainted Nights” and admission was \"50 cents for gents and 35 cents for ladies.\"\nOver the years, the Casino hosted shows by Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and acts like the Everly Brothers and Buffalo Springfield. An undated poster from the '60s promotes a Beach Boys show. Admission: $2.\nWagner has acts booked throughout the summer and has worked with general manager Dion Block to create a menu that doesn't disrupt other area businesses, such as the nearby Wheel House, which specializes in pizza.\n\"We want to be part of something that's already really great,\" Wagner said of the Chain O'Lakes.\nThe improvements made by Wagner are impressive, said previous owner Maria Behlke.\n\"It's been a part of our lives for so long,\" said Behlke, who had owned the Casino and adjacent Ding's Dock boat rental business with husband Bill since the early 1980s.\n\"He's younger and has a lot of good ideas. I'm sure he'll do well.\""},{"url":"http://www.hcn.org/issues/49.9/i-lost-my-friend-on-a-river-trip-heres-what-ive-learned","title":"Death on the river","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":null,"description":"As summer rafting season begins, safe passage to all river runners.","date":"","full_text":"Note: the opinions expressed in this column are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of High Country News, its board or staff. If you'd like to share an opinion piece of your own, please write Betsy Marston at betsym@hcn.org.\nAndrew Gulliford is a contributor to Writers on the Range, the opinion service of High Country News. He is a professor of history and environmental studies at Fort Lewis College, gulliford_a@fortlewis.edu.\nAs spring returns to the Rockies, I think about a day last summer when we packed for a rafting trip, never thinking to pack for death. We took clothes, cameras, river gear, sleeping bags and tents. We never dreamed there might be a tragedy, a whitewater death by drowning. And yet that accident happened, and our lives were forever changed the instant the raft flipped.\nIt took hours for a helicopter to come by, low and slow, searching for the kind of shadow that reveals where a body might be hidden underwater, pinned by boulders.\nFour other rafts were well ahead of us when our raft slammed into a submerged tree and the commercial river guide yelled, “High side! High side!” That meant we had to move fast to the upside of our raft to prevent water from getting into the low side and flipping us. But in a tight canyon with the river roaring at 9,000 cubic feet per second, everything happened simultaneously. The raft tossed all six of us into 45 degree water. I blew out the back end and swam to a log near an island. I looked around for my companions. I saw no one.\nIt was the first day and the first rapid on a four-day rafting trip. In those seconds after the accident, as I tried to understand what had happened, I heard only the rushing water. Then I saw the upside-down raft bobbing furiously in the river, caught in the kind of submerged tree that river-runners call a strainer.\nI stayed on the log, debating whether to try to get to the island, when our guide appeared out of the thick willows. He saw me and patted his head. I patted mine in turn to signal that I was OK. We couldn’t hear each other over the sound of the river. He turned around and melted back into the brush, and I stayed a few more minutes on the log, my impromptu sanctuary.\nIn 20 years of river running, I’ve experienced plenty of flips, but this one felt different. I reached the island, removed my lifejacket and helmet and tried to dry off as the sun climbed the cliff. Then one of the couples who had been in the front of our raft appeared, both of them barefoot because the river had ripped their sandals off. We hugged.\nWe explored the island. On both channels the river roared by too swiftly for us to make a safe exit. Then we saw two guides signaling to each other across the river about how many of us had been rescued. And that is when we knew: One of us was lost.\nRiver running, both in private boats and commercially, has become firmly established in the Rocky Mountain West. Families want a taste of adventure, cold water splashed on hot skin, yells and shouts of excitement, a reason to hang on to the “chicken line” as the rafts tumble through rapids. We crave excitement.\nOur group had planned this trip months in advance without knowing that a record snowpack would force the dam above us to release huge amounts of cold water, not only to save the dam but also for downstream irrigation. These pulse floods are healthy for the environment, re-establishing habitat for endangered fish and bird species. But with high flows, there is little margin for human error. Now, as the bright sunshine ebbed towards late afternoon shade, we survivors were grateful simply to be alive.\nThe next hours blend together. I recall deep wails and sobs of grief from the man whose partner was missing. He kept saying, “Why her, God? Why not me? Take me, I’m older.” The inevitable questions arose about the random nature of death, who dies, and why.\nWeeks later, I thought about the hidden complexities of the situation. Here we were, trapped in a canyon, and yet also caught between some of the West’s other competing activities, things like farming and irrigation, activities far removed from river running. The Bureau of Reclamation, I had learned, would not slow a scheduled release from one of their big dams — not even to retrieve a body.\nThere were 28 passengers on the trip, and among them were grandparents who’d brought their grandchildren. I hoped those children did not blame the river. We had chosen to be in the wilderness, and that choice had irrevocable consequences.\nSnow is melting now in the backcountry. Rivers will rise in June from snowmelt, and rafters will launch with a sense of nervous expectation. To every river runner and every excited passenger: I wish you safe passage."},{"url":"http://buffalonews.com/2017/06/02/100-things-lockport-caves","title":"100 Things: Try Lockport Cave Tour \u0026 Underground Boat Ride - The Buffalo News","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Buffalo News","description":"Summer is the time for road trips.

And so we celebrate Americana. We are talking weird roadside attractions, curiosities visitors see while passing through. Things you equate with the Travel Channel, Boy Scouts, and Ripley's Believe it Or Not.\nWestern New York has a gem of Americana in the Lockport Cave Tour and Underground Boat Ride.\nUnless you live in Lockport, you may not have heard of this tour. Out-of-towners flock to it, though, and praise it on travel sites. It's inexpensive, and surely unique in the world. The 70-minute tour, rain or shine, explores not a man-made cave but a vast tunnel blasted into solid rock in the middle of the 19th century.\nAbandoned for years, it was part of a huge factory owned by inventor Birdsill Holly, an Auburn native and friend of Thomas Edison. He used Erie Canal water to power his machinery.\nOh, do not ask what is it. Let us go and make our visit. The tour's quaint headquarters are at 5 Gooding St., right by Lockport's famous locks.\nTwo of us from The News caught a 1 p.m. tour. It was a rainy weekday, and our only fellow tourists were a pair from Maryland, Barbara LePont and her 17-year-old son, Kyle. Kyle was mechanically inclined and, shockingly, knew who Birdsill Holly was. Imagine that! Even our irrepressible tour guide, a Niagara University theater grad named Paige Donatelli, was momentarily speechless.\nIt's crazy, when an outsider knows more about Western New York than you do. I brooded about that as the Maryland visitors asked knowledgeable questions about the Flight of Five, Lockport's historic locks. And then came something I had no idea existed.\nWho has heard of the Lockport Upside-Down Railroad Bridge?\nPaige filled us in: During the Civil War, to save on steel, someone had the idea of building railroad bridges upside-down. She said ours is one of the few upside-down bridges still operating.\nSince then I have gotten on Google, and I have not been able to find one other one. Neither, apparently, has the website Buzzfeed. Because Buzzfeed named the Lockport Upside Down Railroad Bridge as the weirdest thing in New York State. Not one of the weirdest things. The weirdest thing. Up there with the Creepy Nightmare Whale in Oklahoma, Idaho's Spud Drive-In Movie Theater, and the great Jimmy Carter Peanut Statue in Georgia.\nIn contrast to these other attractions, our bridge is beautiful. Gawking up at it, I wondered: How had I missed this thing?\nThe ruins of Holly's factory, too, hide in plain sight.\n\"Sharknado\" features a scene shot inside this \"cave.\" Ghost hunting shows have come through with their creepy equipment. Paige, readying us for our visit, invited us to peer into a hole in the wall.\n\"People love it,\" she said. \"And you never see anything.\" True. All you see is darkness.\nYou enter that darkness by walking through a huge pipe that used to be full of cascading water. It takes a bit of nerve. And it takes more nerve, once you're inside, to get past the point where your guide kills the lights for a minute, plunging you into pitch darkness.\n\"This is what a miner would see if he kicked over his light,\" Paige told us.\nShe then explained, to our horror and fascination, how this tunnel was hewn in the 1850s out of hard Lockport dolomite. One guy would hold a giant drill bit while another guy bashed it into the rock. Once they had a good-sized hole, boys age 8 to 12 would go in with dynamite. The kids made more money than the grown-ups, but then they had a risky job -- to light the fuse and then run like crazy.\nPowder monkeys, those kids were called. You had to stop for a minute and let that all sink in, the courage involved in building Holly's dream.\nThe boat ride, 40 feet underground, ends the tour with a touch of romance. It's almost like the boat scene from \"The Phantom of the Opera.\" The darkness, the flickering lights, the soft rocking of the boat, the water beneath you --\nAnd the water above you.\n\"We like to call this our mini-Niagara Falls,\" Paige sang out. Sure enough, water came down, from drips to rivers. You are going to get wet.\nBut your sodden clothes can remind you the rest of the day that you were in the presence of greatness.\nHolly's gravestone, in Lockport's Cold Springs Cemetery, is worn by time and reads simply, \"B. Holly, 1820-1894.\" When you get his achievements straight, though, they are amazing. He had next to no formal education. Yet he revolutionized steam heating, coming up with a system that came into universal use. He also drew up the ingenious fire protection system of hydrants and pressurized water now used by virtually every city in America and Europe. Holly had 150 patents, second only to Edison.\nTo most visitors, the Lockport Cave Tour and Underground Boat Ride is a cool way to spend a hot day. To the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, it is hallowed ground, one of their national Heritage Sites.\nThomas Edison once came to Lockport and marveled at the Holly Manufacturing Co. We should, too.\nWhy should out-of-towners have all the fun?"},{"url":"https://qz.com/997008/emmanuel-macron-skewers-trump-in-the-first-ever-english-address-from-the-elysee-make-our-planet-great-again","title":"Macron skewers Trump in the first-ever English address by a French president from the Élysée","author_text":"Roya Wolverson","keywords":[],"publication_text":"Quartz","description":"With his fierce handshake and harsh words, France's new president is on an anti-Trump bender.

Macron reportedly told Trump that France would keep working with the US, but not on climate change. He also issued a joint statement with Germany and Italy affirming that the Paris accords would not be renegotiated.\nBut his strongest reprimand came in a televised address the same night from the Élysée Palace. Macron, who entered office less than a month ago, gave the address in French and English, making him the first French president (link in French) to stray from the cherished national tongue by speaking to his country and the world in English from the Élysée. While he started off in French, he briskly moved into a 3-minute lecture in English on Trump’s “error for the interests of his country, his people and a mistake for the future of our planet.”\n“Don’t be mistaken on climate; there is no plan B because there is no planet B,” he said.\nMacron went on to beckon American scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and committed citizens to “find in France a second homeland. I call on them: ‘Come here with us to work together on concrete solutions for our climate.'”\nIn a nod to Trump’s bravado about US power, Macron reassured Americans that “the world believes in you. I know that you are a great nation.” He wrapped it all up quite neatly, asking the world to abide by words Trump would understand: “Make our planet great again.”"},{"url":"https://thedevelopmentset.com/the-ahca-may-kill-me-27f55d186752","title":"The AHCA May Kill Me – The Development Set","author_text":"Katie MacBride","keywords":[],"publication_text":"The Development Set","description":"The first time I calculated the cost of my life, I was 21 years old.

But it can allow people like me — with “preexisting conditions” — access to affordable healthcare.\nThe first time I calculated the cost of my life, I was 21 years old. I was on my way to Lake Tahoe with a friend; the pain started slowly, the kind of abdominal discomfort I was used to after a lifetime of a self-diagnosed “sensitive stomach.” It felt as though there was too much air in my belly, a painful constricting that could be relieved by some loud, embarrassing farts. So we drove on. No farts.\nThe pain increased, oscillating between short, sharp pains and longer, stomach curling aches. It was as though hot, rubbery ropes were snaking their way through my lower abdomen, constricting the life out of anything in their way. With each labored breath, they got bigger and stronger, pushing against the walls of my stomach with increasing urgency. We pulled over at the rest stop outside Truckee so I could try to go to the bathroom. For the first time in my life, I desperately wanted to have explosive diarrhea. I prayed to the god of rest stops that whatever was happening inside me would find and orifice and get the hell out, it didn’t matter how. Nothing came. The pain continued to swell.\nI tried to hobble back to the car — pale, sweaty, and bent at the waist — but I couldn’t make it. I tumbled to the ground and pushed my face into the concrete. It was cool. Dirty as fuck but cool. Sweat streamed off my forehead and pooled onto the asphalt, making small rivers around the nearby bottle caps and cigarette butts.\nMy friend ran over. “Are you sure you don’t want to go to the hospital?” he asked, looking uncertain about how hard he should push me to go. “This is kind of your last chance.” The cabin we were driving to was at least an hour away from the closest hospital.\nI wasn’t sure. It was 2006, pre-Affordable Care Act. I was allowed to be on my parents’ insurance because of my status as a full-time college student (otherwise I would have been kicked off their insurance at 19). Still, I knew ER visits weren’t cheap and that insurance didn’t cover everything. What if I went to the hospital and it turned out to be nothing more than the most painful case of gas in human history? What if the hospital performed a bunch of tests not covered by insurance and it turned out that I had overreacted? When I applied for my own insurance after graduation the following year, would my rate be higher because of a potentially frivolous ER visit? I didn’t know how it worked; I’d been fortunate enough to not have to worry about it until now. But I had heard hospital bill horror stories–-friends who were denied insurance because they’d been diagnosed with depression, acquaintances who had gone into debt over services their insurance didn’t cover. These fought for space around the blinding pain in my head.\nFinally, the pain won. I was still worried that I was screwing myself out of insurance forever, but at some point I stopped caring. I just needed the pain to stop.\nBy the time my friend and I arrived at the hospital, I was slipping in and out of consciousness. Many tests, scans, and injections of blessed, blessed morphine later, we discovered that I had been living with a congenital birth defect. My colon had never properly attached to my body.\nThe doctor called it a floating colon. “Picture a shoelace floating through goo,” he said. Some people can live their whole lives with a floating colon, hence mine going undetected for so long. The other possibility — my reality — occurs when the colon twists itself into a knot. In that scenario, the blood to the organ is cut off and the colon becomes gangrenous. If left untreated, it’s fatal.\nI probably would have made it to the cabin that evening, but I certainly wouldn’t have made it back.\nI had two surgeries over the course of my month in the Tahoe Forest Hospital. In the first, the surgeon cut the knotted/gangrenous portion of my colon out and sewed the two healthy halves together. I began the slow, painful process of recovery. Five days later, I spiked a high fever. A nurse stood by my bed taking temperature reading after temperature reading when a team of nurses swooped in with ice packs and began shoving them under my armpits, behind my neck and the backs of my legs. The doctors determined that the stitches in my colon hadn’t held. I was septic. The surgeon rushed me back into the OR for a second procedure.\nThe second surgery took, but was not without its consequences. This is unavoidable. Rarely can a person have part of a major organ removed without consequences. The part of my colon they removed was, in addition to other functions, the part of the colon that breaks down and absorbs fat. They also removed the ileocecal valve, which separates the small and large intestine and helps regulate bacteria in the gut. I had to eliminate flour, dairy, and high fat, fried foods from my diet. Going out to dinner or traveling quickly became complicated and occasionally impossible. These were small prices I was more than willing to pay.\nRemoving parts of my intestines saved my life. But it also gave me a digestive system that is complicated and unpredictable. In short, it gave me a pre-existing condition.\nAfter leaving the hospital, few things lingered with more intensity than fear. The inescapable knowledge that I could feel fine one moment and be critically ill the next was all-consuming. I began to see my body not as something that was a working part of me but more like a rogue agent, unpredictable and utterly frightening.\nA few months after I was released from the hospital, this fear was confirmed. I was home from college for the semester to recover from the surgeries. My dad and I were eating takeout and watching a movie, and I was slowly crawling back towards some feeling of normalcy. As with the Tahoe trip, everything was fine until it wasn’t. The incongruous swelling of my stomach and constricting of my intestines was back. We rushed to the ER. I didn’t think about it this time.\nThe surgeries had left too much scar tissue in my colon. Something I had eaten was getting caught. Surgeries to fix one thing often create other, usually less serious problems. If it didn’t pass after 24 hours of NPO (no food or drink by mouth), they would have to operate again. Yes, the doctor said, operating again may well lead to more scar tissue and the whole process repeating.\nFortunately, the procedure worked. But it was, quite literally, a crapshoot. I had no control over the situation; I couldn’t do anything to tilt the scale in my favor. I just had to wait and hope.\nWaiting and hoping is a big theme for me, and for many other people with chronic conditions. I do everything within my power to make my digestive system happy — I adhere to a strict, boring diet, take probiotics, and have undergone every digestive test known to medical science. I have spent an inordinate amount of time on forums for people suffering from Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (not exactly my condition, but the closest approximation that’s common enough to have dedicated online discussion forums). I have spent endless hours sobbing on the toilet in pain while reluctantly texting friends to say I won’t be able to meet up after all.\nI tell myself it is the price of being alive, that I should be grateful — and I am. I was also grateful in 2014, when The Affordable Care Act took effect.\nWhat the Affordable Care Act offered me, and people like me, was a measure of freedom previously unknown to people with pre-existing conditions and otherwise complicated bodies. I was finally able to purchase insurance instead of being tied to an employer. My health did not have to determine the trajectory of my professional life, at least not as acutely as it had before. In May of last year, I left my full-time job to focus on freelance writing. That career move was only possible for me because the ACA mandated that I could not be priced out of the market because my weird colon hadn’t formed properly in utero.\nOn May 4th, the House of Representatives gleefully passed the AHCA. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the AHCA will result in 23 million people losing their health insurance, resulting in families making over $250,000 a year receiving a tax cut. Senate Republicans claim they don’t support the bill as passed, but many senators are as committed to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act as their House counterparts. This back and forth could take months, or even years, to be resolved. So it is back to waiting and hoping. Waiting and hoping to find out I haven’t sacrificed my health for my career.\nWhat precautions should I take during this period of uncertainty, as my healthcare is dangled about as a political prop and swatted at like a cat toy? Do I start squirreling money away in an account specifically for healthcare? Do I fill a prescription for a digestive medication I haven’t needed in a few years, in case I need it again at some point after I no longer have insurance? What should I do if my stomach starts to swell and constrict? Do I try to stay off the hospital’s radar — or do I simply accept my fate as An Uninsurable and get all the health care I can before it becomes too expensive for me to have any at all?\nMy intestinal problems are only one of the pre-existing conditions outlined by the AHCA. Like many of us with chronic conditions, I have also been diagnosed with clinical depression — another ailment corporations would rather not insure. Stress is a huge factor for many of us with chronic conditions, so I can only imagine the symptoms that flared up as politicians went on cable news shows to talk about CBO scores, midterm elections, and fiscal responsibility.\nThe ACA does not guarantee me, or anyone, health. It does not prevent the stitches from breaking, it doesn’t eliminate battles with insurance companies over medications that require prior authorizations, it doesn’t guarantee that you will be able to see the doctor of your choice, or that you won’t have to make huge sacrifices to pay for your healthcare and that even then, it might be tough sometimes.\nPeople with preexisting conditions do not magically get better because of the ACA. We simply have access to healthcare.\nWe are guaranteed that we will not be priced out of or denied insurance because of the way our bodies are built. We are guaranteed to not be kicked off insurance just because we hit an arbitrary lifetime limit or happen to be poor or elderly. The ACA was a sliver of comfort in an unpredictable world filled with unpredictable bodies.\nBut that sliver is gone. It vanished the same afternoon I watched a bunch of white men in suits gather in the Rose Garden of the White House to drink beer and congratulate themselves on a political win for their team.\nI am afraid for myself, for everyone who knows what it’s like when their body rebels against them. For the people who are covered with scars from incisions and central lines. I am brokenhearted that our access to healthcare will be limited, simply because of the way our bodies are built.\nUncertainty is part of being human. Our bodies are fallible in a million different ways and no one’s future is guaranteed. No government can change this. No matter what legislation the government passes you still might end up face down outside a truck stop, paralyzed by pain. But the government can do one thing: it can save you from lying there alone, trying to calculate if you can pay the cost of your own life.\nThe Development Set is made possible by funding from the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation.

As many as 50 percent to 70 percent of community college students enter college unprepared to take these courses, and fewer than 20 percent of such students ever successfully complete a college-level math course; the rest are effectively blocked from achieving a college degree. In 2012, the Charles A.

In 2014, the Center for the Analysis of Postsecondary Readiness, with support from the U.S. Department of Education’s Institute of Education Sciences, partnered with the Dana Center to launch a rigorous evaluation of the DCMP. Overall, the findings are encouraging; DCMP students are having qualitatively different classroom experiences from those of students in traditional developmental math courses and enrolling in and passing these courses at higher rates.

Her words resonate today amid the ever-increasing shopping frenzy and hype, and I, for one, refuse to get caught up in the fray.\nNot that I’m a total curmudgeon, mind you. Choosing just the right present for someone is one of life’s greatest pleasures. Below are some ideas fitting the sustainable ideal in one way or another that have caught my fancy.\nFor an Aspiring Orchardist or Cider Maker\nThanks to the thriving interest in eating locally wherever you may be, a whole new generation or two has discovered not just the amazing diversity of apples in the United States but their links to the culture and history of various regions. In the postelection turmoil, I can also think of nothing more optimistic and cheering than cultivating trees.\nThe folks at your local county extension service can help you find nearby specialty nurseries for heirloom stock, but here are several mail-order sources I know about firsthand: in the East, Century Farm Orchards in North Carolina, which specializes in old Southern varieties, and Vintage Virginia Apples. Trees from $20.\nIf you’re feeling flush, why not include a copy of Old Southern Apples, by Creighton Lee Calhoun Jr. or Apples of North America, by Tom Burford—both classics and beautiful books to boot.\nFans of Diane Flynt’s splendid Foggy Ridge hard ciders (which made my 2015 list of gift picks) should know that the award-winning cider house in the Blue Ridge Mountains also offers a wide array of scion wood (budded dormant sticks) for traditional English cider apples (including Dabinett and Tremlett’s Bitter), as well as American heirlooms such as Hewes Crab and Harrison. The scion wood comes in 10-inch sticks. $3.50 each ($35 minimum order). Curious about hard cider in general? Got you covered.\nIf you’re based in the western United States, one small yet great source for apple and other fruit and nut trees is the Felix Gillet Institute, named for the father of perennial agriculture in California and the Pacific Northwest and “dedicated to the appreciation, preservation and propagation of edible and ornamental heirloom perennials from the Sierra.” Trees from $30.\nFor Bakers and Whole-Grain Lovers\nWe all know that messing around in the kitchen somehow makes us feel better, but as it turns out, there might be a scientific reason why. On Nov. 29, the Smithsonian reported that a study published in the Journal of Positive Psychology may suggest that people who frequently involve themselves in small, creative projects like baking report feeling more relaxed and happier in their everyday lives. Let’s take that and run with it.\nEver since I wrote about the virtues of grinding your own flour—a terrific example of how something that takes just minutes repays you a thousand times over with freshness and flavor—I’ve been mildly obsessed with household mills. Yes, they can be super expensive, but personally, I’d be thrilled to find a Mockmill, an attachment to fit stand mixers, under the tree this year. $149, Mockmill.\nFor DIY Fermenters\nThe beauty of this countertop-friendly two-liter fermentation crock from J.B. Prince, one of the world’s top purveyors of culinary equipment, is that it’s clear glass, so it’s easy to keep an eye on the transformative process within, whether making pickles, kimchi, sauerkraut for a simple choucroute garnie, or more. $30.\nNow, a spot of shameless self-promotion: Throw in a copy of the inaugural issue of Cured, a magazine devoted to the art and craft of preserving food. I’m the executive editor, but even if I weren’t, I’d still think it’s the hottest new publication out there. Available at selected indie bookstores, Barnes \u0026 Noble, and by mail order from curedmagazine.com (shipping is free, free, free); $20.\nFor Cheese Heads\nThese days, when you can get a perfectly serviceable piece of cheese at a big-box store, a cheese-of-the-month club or sampler sounds outmoded—but not when you’re talking the finest artisanal examples from Formaggio Kitchen, the legendary shop in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, and New York (it also offers tasting classes). Gild the lily by adding a copy of the just-published The Oxford Companion to Cheese, the most comprehensive (and compulsively readable) reference book on the subject. Cheese clubs, from $225; samplers, from $33.\nFor the Hostess\nHelping to fill someone’s house with delicious things to eat or otherwise use up and enjoy is something that will be appreciated and remembered long after the holidays are over. In a perfect world, of course, you would have the time to make something—a roll of slice-and-bake cookies or cheese wafers, for instance, that the lucky recipient could tuck into the freezer for a later date (or not).\nAn inspired pairing of honey and beeswax candles or pure maple syrup and artisanal pancake mix are a couple of tried-and-true options. When it comes to the freshest possible extra-virgin olive oil, look no farther than the new Limited Reserve from top-drawer producer California Olive Ranch. This, the first harvest of the 2016 season and tremendous bang for the buck, is made in the Italian “early harvest” tradition—that is, bottled with little nuggets of the olive fruit, and it’s richly flavored without being too grab-you-by-the-throat peppery. 500 ml bottle, $20."},{"url":"http://www.newsminer.com/news/local_news/johnsen-senate-cuts-will-force-another-tuition-hike/article_487bd714-4833-11e7-9e20-1339154b7ac8.html","title":"Johnsen: Senate cuts will force another tuition hike","author_text":"Matt Buxton mbuxton@newsminer.com","keywords":["Tuition","Legislature","Budget","Cuts","Senate"],"publication_text":"Fairbanks Daily News-Miner","description":"FAIRBANKS — The University of Alaska has resisted mid-year tuition increases amid year-after-year cuts handed down by the Legislature, but the UA president said it would be forced to make","date":"","full_text":"FAIRBANKS — The University of Alaska has resisted mid-year tuition increases amid year-after-year cuts handed down by the Legislature, but the UA president said it would be forced to make one if the state Senate’s proposed cuts are adopted.\nUncertainty about state funding for the UA system dominated discussions during the two-day Board of Regents meeting that concluded Friday in Fairbanks.\nThe House and Gov. Bill Walker have proposed flat funding for the university at\n$325 million while the Senate first proposed $309 million before cutting it further to $303 million. The figure is part of the state operating budget, which is one of the many pieces of the state’s fiscal plan that are unresolved as the Legislature enters the second half of its special session.\nUA President Jim Johnsen offered a variety of contingency plans for different possible funding levels, ranging from flat funding to the Senate’s $303 million figure. Much of the cuts would come from reductions to expenses divvied out across campuses.\nThe University of Alaska Fairbanks would suspend and discontinue additional academic programs, offer fewer courses of the remaining classes and close a dorm amid four pages of potential changes presented to the regents.\nJohnsen said he’s against a mid-year tuition increase and said that regents had heard as much from students during recent public testimony sessions but said the Senate’s figures would leave the university little choice in the matter.\n“We’ve talked about tuition a little bit and we’ve addressed a mid-year tuition increase. It’s my recommendation that we don’t introduce a mid-year tuition increase for the reasons that our students have expressed to us ... until a $309 (million) scenario or a $303 (million) worst-case scenario,” he said. “We need to do our best as long as we possibly can to avoid a mid-year tuition increase.”\nThe budget proposals for either Senate figure contain a 10 percent tuition increase that would be expected to raise about $5 million in additional revenue. Even under those scenarios, the university would still have to cut more than $12 million across the system.\nThe university budget for the coming year already contains a 5 percent tuition increase, but Johnsen said with declining enrollment it’s expected that there will be no overall change in tuition revenue for the university.\nThe issue highlights an ongoing problem for the university of declining enrollment, and much of the rest of the meeting was spent addressing plans to boost enrollment and student retention on each campus.\nPart of those are considered strategic investments, which include $2.1 million spread across the three campuses for what Johnsen called an “aggressive strategic marketing” plan for the university.\nThe chancellors of each university also presented each campus’ plan to boost enrollment and retention.\nOutgoing interim UAF Chancellor Dana Thomas said the Fairbanks campus has put together many recruitment and retention teams that generated more than 150 ideas to bolster the student population.\n“Recruitment is a long-term effort. It’s all about relationships,” he said. “It takes an effort, a concerted effort.”\nThomas explained that much of the recruitment is focused on traditional efforts such as school counselors, career fairs and direct relationships but said that targeted digital advertising could also be effective. He also said the university saw great potential in the stationing of the F-35s at Eielson Air Force Base.\nContact staff writer Matt Buxton at 459-7544.

Baumgart, now 25, is the individual contributions researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent, nonpartisan organization.\nDuring last year’s presidential election, he spent a lot of time keeping track of the financial contributions candidates received from a variety of groups, including finance and real estate, fossil fuels, and even from Hollywood. The organization’s copywriters used Baumgart’s data in articles published on the organization’s website, Opensecrets.org, which was used as a fact-checking source for those wanting clarity on where candidates got their money.\n“It’s an accountability thing,” he says. “You want to know who is financially supporting candidates and how their support may influence candidates’ policies and regulations. It all comes down to transparency.”\nBaumgart says his work carries a tremendous responsibility. Helping Americans gain access to factual and easy-to-read information about the role of money in politics and policy, he believes, strengthens the nation’s democracy.\nAngie Drobnic Holan\nRanking degrees of accuracy\nAngie Drobnic Holan has always been a political news junkie. When she was 11, she faithfully tuned in to The McLaughlin Group, a weekly public affairs TV program hosted by political commentator John McLaughlin.\nToday Holan is pursuing a similar mission to that of the now-deceased McLaughlin, but she doesn’t provide commentary on politicians’ statements—she fact-checks them.\nIn 2007, Holan, who had worked in journalism for nearly 15 years, helped launch PolitiFact, a fact-checking website run by editors from the Tampa Bay Times, an independent newspaper in Florida. At PolitiFact, Holan rates the accuracy of claims made by America’s elected officials, lobbyists, and interest groups.\nHolan uses a variety of fact-checking tools: She asks the politicians themselves for their sources, and searches online news databases and archives. Politifact won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the 2008 presidential election and conducted a high-profile fact-checking effort during the drafting of the Affordable Care Act.\n“We debunked a lot of rumors and misconceptions around that law,” Holan says.\nFact-checking is satisfying work, she says, because it informs democracy.\nTaking leads from whispers to fact\nGary Ruskin is the co-founder and co-director of U.S. Right to Know, a nonprofit food industry watchdog group, where he produces reports that reveal the harmful effects of chemicals used in the food system.\nRuskin says most of his investigations stem from leads given to him by food industry insiders and whistleblowers, sources with whom he has made connections over the past 30 years. Ruskin then tracks down official documents to fact-check these leads and publishes the documents on the organization’s website, where members of the public and media professionals can also use them as a fact-checking source.\nIn 2013, while director of the Center for Corporate Policy, Ruskin published Spooky Business: Corporate Espionage Against Non-profits, a report detailing how some businesses spy on nonprofit groups they regard as potential threats. He says fact-checking information and tips from sources was a crucial part in publishing the report.\n“I really had to put on my fact-checking hat and read documents line by line with a skeptical eye, because our work is only as good as our reputation,” Ruskin says. “So if we say things that aren’t true, then no one would listen to us.”"},{"url":"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/The-best-things-I-learned-after-I-moved-to-the-6573241.php","title":"Things I learned after I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area","author_text":null,"keywords":[],"publication_text":"SFGate","description":"Not everyone is lucky enough to be born and raised in San Francisco, and for those of us who had the opportunity to move to the Bay Area, there may have been a steep learning curve.","date":"","full_text":"Not everyone is lucky enough to be born and raised in San Francisco, and for those of us who had the opportunity to move to the Bay Area, there may have been a steep learning curve.\nThere are the obvious lessons many of us expect to face, such as figuring out how to pay an exorbitant amount of money for rent each month or navigating the complications that can come with riding Muni and BART.\nRelated Stories\nThe stories behind San Francisco's street names\n14 Bay Area facts that sound like urban legends\nReader reactions to Bay Area pronunciations and what we got ‘wrong’\nSome things you learn quickly, such as needing to hold your breath and watching where you step while walking down certain San Francisco streets.\nOther things you'll learn the embarrassing way.

For the past two years, selling artwork on the street has helped the previously homeless San Francisco native afford an SRO senior housing unit on 6th Street.\nTo make the art, Sanchez says he’s been visiting the public art studio every day for the past two-and-a-half years. The practice acts as a kind of self-driven art therapy for him. “I’d rather be constructive than destructive,” he says.\n“I’ve never been able to beg,” Sanchez continued. “I don’t want to ask for something for nothing.” By creating and selling art, he’s able to contribute to the culture of the city. Much of the money he makes goes back into buying art supplies, some of which he distributes to homeless youth he meets on the streets. During the holidays, he devotes a chunk of money to making copies of his Santa Claus poster to pass out to homeless children.\n“The main reason I [make art] is to put a smile on people’s faces,” says Sanchez.\nThat day, Sanchez had covered an entire table with his work: vibrant visual love letters — and notes of criticism — to San Francisco. On the right, are his signature San Francisco post cards, featuring Betty Boop posing in front of the Golden Gate Bridge and a banner with the nickname “Frisco” across the top. He originally created the scene as a large painting, but made small copies so he could sell them for $3 a pop to tourists. Like the rest of his artwork, the image is rendered in an aesthetic nostalgic for the San Francisco of the ’60s — a playful, gritty illustration style reminiscent of early underground comics, mixed with a psychedelic palette harkening back to Haight and Ashbury’s heyday.\nDespite his stylistic allusions to the past, Sanchez’s content is cleverly contemporary. On the left, a clock with a painted face features a comical critique of texting: Two skeleton-like figures are drawn with their eyes literally popped out of their sockets and glued to their smart phones; In the center, a massive hand emerges from the ground like an awakened zombie, clutching a phone chained to its wrist.\n“I get inspiration from the news,” said Sanchez, pulling out a poster that comments on house flipping practices, featuring a caricature of mayor Ed Lee with his hands up in a panic. “Luckily, the mayor looks like a cartoon.”\nSanchez says he pushes his artwork around in a mail cart and sells it wherever he happens to be: “On BART, in a café, on the street.” Aside from cards, he has a huge selection of posters, which he gets printed at a copy shop. He also sells screen-printed shirts and hand-painted jackets with his original designs. And, once in a while, his illustrations are published in the newspaper Street Sheet, which focuses on problems that homeless people face.\nWhen speaking about the past, Sanchez maneuvers around the less savory stuff, always staying positive. He speaks only sparingly about his time living on the streets and in his car, and how seeing kids attempting to light homeless people on fire drove him to finally find housing.\n‘I get inspiration from the news. Luckily, the mayor looks like a cartoon.’\nInstead, he talks about being born on Candlestick Drive into a family with 11 kids, riding bikes around the city with his siblings and being thrown free peanuts from the salesman at Candlestick Park. A poet and musician before he was ever a visual artist, Sanchez also recalls jamming at big bonfire parties in the late ’70s and reading poetry at City Lights bookstore. Sometimes, he would make art under a now towering tree in Golden Gate Park that he and fellow classmates planted 45 years ago as a seedling.\nBut in the decades since, Sanchez says that his daughter and grandkids were evicted from their home on the basis of the Ellis Act and forced to move out of the Bay Area because they could no longer afford it. So, his primary goal is to acquire a vehicle in order to visit them.\n“San Francisco isn’t the same as it used to be,” he says."},{"url":"https://sfhomelessproject.com/why-art-making-is-essential-to-the-tenderloins-homeless-population-8bb95728b01e","title":"Why Art-Making is Essential to the Tenderloin’s Homeless Population","author_text":"KQED","keywords":[],"publication_text":"SF Homeless Project","description":"Jo Jackson is working this sunny late spring afternoon on a series of small watercolors. “I like to build colors,” Jackson says. “I’m making a sun shape first, so that’s just an easy circular motion…","date":"2016-06-29","full_text":"By Cy Musiker\nJo Jackson is working this sunny late spring afternoon on a series of small watercolors. “I like to build colors,” Jackson says. “I’m making a sun shape first, so that’s just an easy circular motion that’s so relaxing for me, then I get very bold and add a bright red.”\nJackson is a thin white woman, often bundled in a sweater and scarf. For years, she taught dance in Bolivia and Venezuela. But a series of personal setbacks over the past few years left her living in a San Francisco single room occupancy hotel (SRO), and then in a numbered bunk bed in a Tenderloin women’s shelter.\nJackson especially likes making collages and working with paints. Art, Jackson says, is both a form of expression and a kind of therapy. “Art for me is like water, like a river,” she says. “And water is very life giving and healing.”\nJackson values the free art studio provided by Hospitality House. The homeless services provider is located in the mid-Market neighborhood near 6th Street, a fast gentrifying part of the city.\nIt’s a busy place. As Jackson works on her painting, more than dozen artists, most in living situations like Jackson’s, sketch with pastels or paint with acrylics. A pottery wheel sits against a wall in the studio, next to racks of paper and other supplies.\nHospitality House has served the homeless for nearly 50 years. The facility offers a men’s shelter, leadership development workshops, and job training programs. It also offers the only fine arts studio for the homeless in San Francisco, with more than 3,500 people using the space each year.\nHow art helps homeless people\nWhen you’re lacking the basics of food and shelter, art might not seem like a priority. Yet visitors to Hospitality House consider the creative offerings essential to their existence. “The opportunity to create should be open to everyone, whether you have a home or not,” says Hospitality House executive director Jackie Jenks.\nJackson, together with fellow Hospitality House artist Billy Crawford, recently had an art opening at the space. They’re showing their work at Hospitality House through Friday, Jul. 22. Jackson has sold a few paintings, she says. And all the artists gets 100 percent of the proceeds from sales of their work. Jenks says Hospitality House artists made $16,000 last year.\nArt has been an essential service for Hospitality House since 1969, two years after its founding. “The walls can really seem to close in on you in an SRO or a shelter,” Jenks says. “But here, they’re sharing the beauty of what they can create and what’s in their hearts.”\nA common vision\nHospitality House isn’t only organization in the neighborhood that offers opportunities for homeless people to tap into their creative selves. Jackson is also a frequent visitor at The Healing Well, an offshoot of the street ministry called Faithful Fools. The two organizations share a narrow and cozy building on Hyde Street on the edge of the Tenderloin, where they offer free poetry, yoga, meditation, and clowning classes.\n“When I first got involved in this work, I thought, you’ve got to be kidding,” says Kathy Curran, Healing Well’s founder and director.\n“We’re offering classes like yoga and meditation, and art and poetry. Shouldn’t we be helping these people find housing and get jobs?”\nBut Curran soon saw the value of Healing Well’s offerings. “I quickly realized how important it is for people to have a place where they can develop a sense of calm and confidence in coping with the trials of the past and the opportunities of the future,” she says.\nBack at Hospitality House, Jackson puts her paintbrush in a cup of water. Jackson has found temporary housing for the next three months. She says should be okay, as long as she can continue to make art. “Homelessness isn’t who I am,” Jackson says. “It happens to be something I’m going through right now.”"},{"url":"http://www.businessinsider.com/lifestraw-filtering-straw-overview-2017-3","title":"Hikers and campers don’t need to worry about refilling water bottles anymore thanks to this filtering straw","author_text":"Tyler Lauletta, Insider Picks","keywords":[],"publication_text":"Business Insider","description":"If you’re looking for something to add to your camping bag, survival kit, or bug-out bag, a LifeStraw is a great purchase to make.","date":"","full_text":"The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

We recently wrote about LuminAID, an inflatable, solar-powered lantern that was initially created in order to help bring light to earthquake relief efforts in Haiti. While the company still focuses on good works, LuminAID now also markets to outdoorsmen and women across the country as it's a perfect camping product.\nFollowing a similar trajectory, LifeStraw began with the goal of creating a simple, direct, water-filtration system that would help people in developing countries who don’t have access to clean water. The product, a straw with an internal filter that you can dip into any water source to produce drinkable water, has helped countless people since its invention over a decade ago.\nToday, in addition to its philanthropic origins, LifeStraw is an extremely popular product among campers, climbers, and all other sorts of outdoor explorers. With the ability to get a drink from any water source around, it allows hikers to spends days at a time away from basecamp without carrying around bottle after bottle of extra water, provided they plan on staying close to a river or lake. And with a 4.8/5 star rating on Amazon after over 5,000 reviews, it’s safe to say customers are pleased with the product.\nStill, even with commercial success, LifeStraw stays committed to its charitable roots — for each LifeStraw you purchase, one school child in a developing community receives safe drinking water for an entire school year. If you’re looking for something to add to your camping bag, survival kit, or bug-out bag, a LifeStraw is a great purchase to make.\nLifeStraw Personal Water Filter, $19.95, available at Amazon\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

The Valley employs only 8 percent of the nation’s coders. All the other millions? They’re more like Devon, a programmer I met who helps maintain a security-software service in Portland, Oregon. He isn’t going to get fabulously rich, but his job is stable and rewarding: It’s 40 hours a week, well paid, and intellectually challenging. “My dad was a blue-collar guy,” he tells me—and in many ways, Devon is too.\nPoliticians routinely bemoan the loss of good blue-collar jobs. Work like that is correctly seen as a pillar of civil middle-class society. And it may yet be again. What if the next big blue-collar job category is already here—and it’s programming? What if we regarded code not as a high-stakes, sexy affair, but the equivalent of skilled work at a Chrysler plant?\nAmong other things, it would change training for programming jobs—and who gets encouraged to pursue them. As my friend Anil Dash, a technology thinker and entrepreneur, notes, teachers and businesses would spend less time urging kids to do expensive four-year computer-science degrees and instead introduce more code at the vocational level in high school. You could learn how to do it at a community college; midcareer folks would attend intense months-long programs like Dev Bootcamp. There’d be less focus on the wunderkinds and more on the proletariat.\nThese sorts of coders won’t have the deep knowledge to craft wild new algorithms for flash trading or neural networks. Why would they need to? That level of expertise is rarely necessary at a job. But any blue-collar coder will be plenty qualified to sling JavaScript for their local bank. That’s a solidly middle-class job, and middle-class jobs are growing: The national average salary for IT jobs is about $81,000 (more than double the national average for all jobs), and the field is set to expand by 12 percent from 2014 to 2024, faster than most other occupations.\nAcross the country, people are seizing this opportunity, particularly in states hit hardest by deindustrialization. In Kentucky, mining veteran Rusty Justice decided that code could replace coal. He cofounded Bit Source, a code shop that builds its workforce by retraining coal miners as programmers. Enthusiasm is sky high: Justice got 950 applications for his first 11 positions. Miners, it turns out, are accustomed to deep focus, team play, and working with complex engineering tech. “Coal miners are really technology workers who get dirty,” Justice says.\nMeanwhile, the Tennessee nonprofit CodeTN is trying to nudge high school kids into coding programs at community colleges. Some students (and teachers) worry that the kids don’t fit the Zuckerbergian cliché. That’s a cultural albatross, CodeTN cofounder Caleb Fristoe says. “We need to get more employers saying, ‘Yeah, we just need someone to manage the login page,’” he says. “You don’t have to be a superstar.”\nNow, to be sure, society does need some superstars! Serious innovators, at companies and in academia, are the ones who create new fields like machine learning. But that doesn’t preclude a new mainstream vision of what most programming work actually* is*. For decades, pop culture (and, frankly, writers like me) have overpromoted the “lone genius” coder. We’ve cooed over the billionaire programmers of The Social Network and the Anonymized, emo, leather-clad hackers of Mr. Robot. But the real heroes are people who go to work every day and turn out good stuff—whether it’s cars, coal, or code.\n*This article appears in the December 2016 issue.

The grants were aimed at developing technologies to help make bio-based fuels cost-competitive with fossil fuels in the marketplace.\nUnder former President Barack Obama, the Department of Defense in 2014 called for the addition of 3 gigawatts worth of renewable energy to help meet the electricity demands of military facilities. The mandate was part of a broader departmental directive to use renewable energy resources for at least 25 percent of its energy consumption.\nIn the wake of the 2014 initiative, defense company Lockheed Martin formed a commercial line that would focus on expanding into the energy technology market.\nThe Energy Department said the Fort Drum operation is covered under an 11-year contract that includes arrangements with local growers to source the fuels needed for the power facility.\n\"This project marks a significant step forward in demonstrating the commercial viability of short-rotation woody biomass crops,\" the department said."}]
